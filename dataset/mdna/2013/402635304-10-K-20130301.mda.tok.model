in addition  we own a non operated working interest nri in depths below the base of the sand  which is operated by chevron corporation 
our leasehold interests at wcbb contain  gross acres 
area history and production texaco  now chevron corporation  drilled the discovery well in this field in based on a seismic and gravitational anomaly 
wcbb was subsequently developed on an even acre pattern for much of the remainder of the decade 
developmental drilling continued and reached its peak in the s when over wells were drilled in the field 
of the  wells drilled as of december   were completed as producing wells 
as a result  the field has a historic success rate of for all wells drilled 
from the date of our acquisition of wcbb in through december   we drilled new wells  of which were productive  for a success rate 
as of december   estimated field cumulative gross production was mmboe and bcf of gas 
of the  wells drilled in wcbb as of december   were producing  were shut in  seven were producing intermittently and five were being used as salt water disposal wells 
the other wells have been plugged and abandoned 
in  texaco conducted a square mile d seismic survey with  shot points per mile that processed out fold

we own the rights to the seismic data 
in december  we completed the reprocessing of the seismic data and our technical staff developed prospects from the data 
the reprocessed data has enabled us to identify prospects in areas of the field that would have otherwise remained obscure 
during the first half of  we again reprocessed the seismic data using advanced seismic data processing

index to financial statements and created a complex system of fault traps 
the compensating fault sets generally trend northwest to southeast and are intersected by sets having a major radial component 
later stage movement caused extension over the dome and a large graben system a downthrown area bounded by normal faults was formed 
there are over distinct sandstone reservoirs recognized throughout most of the field  and nearly major and minor discrete intervals have been tested 
within the  wells that had been drilled in the field as of december   over  potential zones have been penetrated 
these sands are highly porous and permeable reservoirs primarily with a strong water drive 
wcbb is a structurally and stratigraphically complex field 
all of the proved undeveloped  or pud  locations at wcbb are adjacent to faults and abut at least one fault 
our drilling programs are designed to penetrate each pud trap with a new wellbore in a structurally optimum position  usually very close to the fault seal 
the majority of these wells have been  and new wells drilled in connection with our drilling programs will be  directionally drilled using steering tools and downhole motors 
the tolerance for error in getting near the fault is low  so the complex faulting does introduce the risk of crossing the fault before encountering the zone of interest  which could result in part or all of the zone being absent in the borehole 
this  in turn  can result in lower than expected or no reserves for that zone 
the new wellbores eliminate the mechanical risk associated with trying to produce the zone from an old existing wellbore  while the wellbore locations are selected in an effort to more efficiently drain each reservoir 
the vast majority of the pud targets are up dip offsets to wells that produced from a sub optimal position within a particular zone 
our inventory of prospects at wcbb as of december  included pud wells 
the drilling schedule used in the reserve report anticipates that all of those wells will be drilled by facilities we own and operate a production facility at wcbb that includes four production tank batteries  eight natural gas compressors  a storage barge facility  a dock  a dehydration unit and a salt water disposal system 
recent and future activity in  we recompleted gross and net wells and drilled gross and net wells at wcbb 
of the new wells drilled at wcbb in  were completed as producers and four were non productive 
as of february   we had recompleted wells during of the wells drilled in  were considered deep wells 
the productive wells  with total depths ranging from  to  feet  have approximately  feet of aggregate apparent net pay 
we currently anticipate drilling to gross and net wells and recompleting gross and net wells at wcbb during production status in the fourth quarter of  our production at wcbb was approximately  net boe  or an average of  boe per day  of which was from oil and of which was from natural gas 
from january  through january   our average net daily production at wcbb was approximately  boe  of which was from oil and of which was from natural gas 
as there was no production from new wells brought on line in january  the decrease in average net daily production was due to normal production declines

structurally  our east hackberry acreage is located on the eastern end of the hackberry salt ridge 
there are over pay zones at this field 
the salt intrusion formed a series of structurally complex and steeply dipping fault blocks in the lower miocene and oligocene age rocks 
these fault blocks serve as traps for hydrocarbon accumulation 
our wells currently produce from perforations found between  and  feet 
facilities we have a field office that serves both the east and west hackberry fields 
in addition  we own and operate three production facilities at east hackberry that include two land based tank batteries  a production barge  four natural gas compressors  dehydration units and salt water disposal systems

utica shale eastern ohio location and land as of december   we had acquired leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres in the utica shale in eastern ohio  including the approximately  net acres acquired in december in february  we acquired approximately  additional net acres in the utica shale 
see recent developments february utica acreage acquisition 
area history based on the estimates published by the ohio department of natural resources  or odnr  in  the utica shale has a recoverable potential of billion to billion barrels of oil and to trillion cubic feet of natural gas in ohio alone 
during  a number of oil and gas companies made significant investments in acquiring utica shale acreage in eastern ohio 
as of february   the odnr reported that in the utica shale in ohio there were producing horizontal wells  horizontal wells that had been drilled but were not yet completed or connected to a pipeline  horizontal wells that were being drilled and an additional horizontal wells that had been permitted 
during  most of the drilling activity in the utica shale occurred in eastern ohio  where our acreage is located 
based on the initial drilling results  the utica shale is prospective for oil and ngls 
specifically  early wells drilled in the utica shale indicated potential for production of significant amounts of ngls  which generally have a higher value  on an energy equivalent basis  than natural gas 
geology the utica shale is located in the appalachian basin of the united states and canada 
the utica shale is a rock unit comprised of organic rich calcareous black shale that was deposited about million to million years ago during the late ordovician period 
it overlies the trenton limestone and is located a few thousand feet below the marcellus shale  which is estimated to be the largest exploration play in the eastern united states 
recently  the application of horizontal drilling  combined with multistaged hydraulic fracturing to create permeable flow paths from wellbores into shale units  has resulted in increased drilling activity and production in the devonian age marcellus shale in the appalachian basin states of pennsylvania  west virginia  southern new york and eastern ohio 
this proven technology has potential for application in other shale units  such as the ordovician age utica shale  which extends across much of the appalachian basin region 
the utica shale is estimated to be thicker and more geographically extensive than the marcellus shale 
the potential source rock portion of the utica shale underlies portions of kentucky  maryland  new york  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  west virginia and virginia in the united states and is also present beneath parts of lake ontario  lake erie and ontario  canada 
throughout the potential source rock area  the utica shale ranges in thickness from less than feet to over feet 
over the rock unit as a whole  there is a general thinning from east to west 
the utica shale is also significantly deeper than the marcellus shale 
in some parts of pennsylvania  the utica shale is estimated to be over two miles below sea level and up to  feet below the marcellus shale 
however  the depth of the utica shale decreases to the west into ohio and to the northwest under the great lakes and into canada to less than  feet below sea level 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the utica shale is estimated to have higher carbonate and lower clay mineral content than the marcellus shale 
the difference in mineralogy generally produces a different response to hydraulic fracturing treatments 
based on early fracturing results in the utica shale  the hydraulic fracturing methods used in the marcellus shale are less productive when applied in the utica shale 
however  drillers have improved the fracturing rates in other gas shales with similar carbonate content 
for example  drillers have discovered methods to make the brittle carbonate zones fracture at higher rates than other gas shale rock units in the eagle ford shale in texas 
drillers are researching methods to make similar fracturing improvements in the utica shale 
facilities there are typical land oil and gas processing facilities in the utica shale 
we will be required to build facilities located at well locations including storage tank batteries  oil gas water separation equipment  vapor recovery line heaters and compression 
recent and future activities we spud our first well  the wagner h  on our utica shale acreage in february and  as of december   had drilled wells  ten of which had been completed 
as of february   three of these wells were producing 
of the additional wells  seven are projected to be producing by april  and the other four wells are projected to be producing by june  the delays in bringing these additional wells online have primarily been associated with markwest energy partners  lp challenges in obtaining rights of way and acquiring necessary state and federal permitting 
these rights of way and permits have now been obtained 
in addition  gross one net wells were drilled by another operator on our utica shale acreage during in february  we acquired approximately  additional net acres in the utica shale 
we have three rigs under contract on our utica shale acreage 
we currently intend to drill gross net wells on our utica shale acreage in production status aggregate net production from the utica shale during the three months ended december  was approximately  boe  or boe per day  of which was from oil and ngls and of which was from natural gas 
during january  our average daily net production from the utica shale was approximately boe  of which was from oil and ngls and of which was from natural gas 
the wagner h well  our longest producing well in the utica shale  was assigned gross proved estimated ultimate recovery reserves at december  of mbbls of oil and bcf of unshrunk natural gas by ryder scott 
adjusting for shrinkage and the extraction of ngls  we estimate that this is equivalent to mmboe of proved reserves 
permian basin west texas location and land in  we acquired approximately  net acres in west texas in the permian basin with production at the time of acquisition from gross net wells  predominately in the wolfcamp formation 
subsequently  we acquired approximately  additional net acres  which brought our total net acreage position in the permian basin to approximately  net acres as of september  from our initial acquisition in the permian basin through the contribution of our permian basin acreage to diamondback on october   gross net wells were drilled on our leasehold acreage in this area  primarily targeting the wolfberry formation 
we were not the operator of our permian basin acreage but were actively involved in the planning and execution of the drilling plans governed by a joint operating agreement with a subsidiary of diamondback  which is the operator in this field 
from january  through the closing of the contribution of our permian basin acreage to diamondback on october   gross net wells  including our first horizontal well  were spud on our permian basin acreage  all of which were completed as producing wells 
one gross net existing well was recompleted from january  to october  aggregate net production from our permian basin acreage during the first eleven days of october was approximately  boe  or  boe per day  of which approximately was oil  was ngls and was natural gas 
the permian basin area covers a significant portion of western texas and eastern new mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the united states 
the terrain in the permian basin is semi arid mesquite mixed grassland steppe 

table of contents 
index to financial statements area history the permian basin formed as an area of rapid mississippian pennsylvanian subsidence in the foreland of the ouachita foldbelt 
the wolfcamp play was a long established reservoir in west texas  first found in the s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or reef facies with reservoir properties 
exploration with d seismic located additional fields  but it was not until the use of d seismic in the s that the greater extent of the wolfcamp prospects was revealed 
during the late s  arco began a drilling program targeting the spraberry formation at  feet and then drilled another to feet to pick up the upper part of the wolfcamp formation 
henry petroleum  a private firm  owned interest in the pegasus field in midland and upton counties 
while drilling in the same area as the arco project  henry petroleum decided to drill completely through the wolfcamp section as devonian wells 
henry petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells using multiple slick water fracs across the entire wolfcamp interval 
in  former members of henry petroleum wolfcamp team formed their own private company  exl petroleum  and began replicating henry petroleum program 
after exl had drilled productive wolfcamp spraberry wells through late  they decided to monetize approximately of their acreage position which enabled us to participate in this play 
recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques continue to make the basin an active play for exploration and production companies 
geology the wolfcamp spraberry play  which we refer to as wolfberry  of the midland basin lies in the area where the historically productive spraberry trend geographically overlaps the productive area of the emerging wolfcamp carbonate play 
the wolfcamp is characterized by an approximately  feet section of organic rich basin floor debris flows shed from the central basin platform 
the best reservoir rock within the section is generally found in close proximity to the central basin platform 
facilities there are typical land oil and natural gas processing facilities in the permian basin 
the facilities located at well locations included storage tank batteries  oil gas water separation equipment and pumping units 
recent and future activity as discussed above under the heading recent developments contribution  on october   we contributed to diamondback  prior to the closing of the diamondback ipo  all of our oil and natural gas interests in the permian basin 
at the closing of this contribution  diamondback issued to us i  shares of diamondback common stock and ii a promissory note for million  which was repaid to us at the closing of the diamondback ipo on october  this aggregate consideration was subject to a post closing cash adjustment based on changes in the working capital  long term debt and certain other items of a subsidiary of diamondback as of the date of this contribution

niobrara formation northwestern colorado location and land effective as of april   we acquired leasehold interests in the niobrara formation in northwestern colorado  and held leases for approximately  net acres as of december  in  three gross one net wells  including one gross 
net well drilled by another operator  were spud on our niobrara formation acreage  two of which were completed as producers and one of which was non productive 
area history the niobrara formation is a shale oil rock formation located in colorado  northwest kansas  southwest nebraska  and southeast wyoming 
oil and natural gas can be found at depths of  to  feet and is drilled both vertically and horizontally 
the upper cretaceous niobrara formation has emerged as another potential crude oil resource play in various basins throughout the northern rocky mountain region 
as with most resource plays  the niobrara formation has a history of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements producing through conventional technology with some of the earliest production dating back to the early s 
natural fracturing has played a key role in producing the niobrara formation historically due to the low porosity and low permeability of the formation 
because of this  conventional production has been very localized and limited in area extent 
we believe the niobrara formation can be produced on a more widespread basis using today horizontal multi stage fracture stimulation technology where the niobrara formation is thermally mature 
geology the niobrara formation oil play in northwestern colorado is located between the piceance basin to the south and the sand wash basin to the north 
rocks mainly consist of interbedded organic rich shales  calcareous shales and marlstones 
it is the fractured marlstone intervals locally known as the buck peak  tow creek and wolf mountain benches that account for the majority of the areas production 
these fractured carbonate reservoirs are associated with anticlinal  synclinal and monoclinal folds  and fault zones 
this proven oil accumulation is considered to be continuous in nature and lightly explored 
source rocks are predominantly oil prone and thermally mature with respect oil generation 
the producing intervals are geologically equivalent to the niobrara formation reservoirs of the dj and powder river basins  which are currently emerging as a major crude resource play 
production status in the fourth quarter of  our net production from our niobrara formation acreage was approximately  boe  or an average of boe per day  of which was from oil

competition and markets the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive  and we compete with other companies that have greater resources 
many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas  but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional  national or worldwide basis 
these competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of industry opportunities and to withstand changes affecting the industry  such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production  the availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulation 
in addition  oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers  primarily based on price 
these alternate forms of energy include electricity  coal and fuel oils 
changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy  as well as business conditions  conservation  legislation  regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the availability of a ready market for any oil and or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management  including but not limited to the demand for oil and natural gas and the level of domestic production and imports of oil  the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines  the availability of skilled labor  materials and equipment  the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of gas sold in interstate commerce 
the oil and natural gas we produce in louisiana is sold to purchasers who service the areas where our wells are located 
we sell the majority of our oil to shell trading company  or shell 
shell takes custody of the oil at the outlet from our oil storage barge 
our production from wcbb is being sold in accordance with the shell posted price for west texas new mexico intermediate crude plus or minus platt trade month average p value  plus or minus the platt hls wti trade month average differential less per barrel for transportation 
during the year ended december   we sold approximately and of our oil production to shell trading company  or shell  and diamondback o g llc a wholly owned subsidiary of diamondback formerly known as windsor permian llc  or diamondback o g  respectively  of our natural gas liquids production to diamondback o g and  and of our natural gas production to noble americas gas  hess and chevron  respectively 
during  we sold and of our oil production to shell and diamondback o g  respectively  of our natural gas liquids production to diamondback o g  and  and of our natural gas production to diamondback o g  chevron and hilcorp energy company  respectively 
during  we sold and of our oil production to shell and diamondback o g  respectively  and   and of our natural gas production to diamondback o g  chevron and hilcorp energy company  respectively 
shell has agreed to purchase our utica shale oil and we have agreements in place with various purchasers for our utica shale natural gas production 
we may not continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production and if a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us  revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed 
however  based on the current demand for oil and natural gas  and the availability of other purchasers  we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well established markets and numerous purchasers 
oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile and are subject to substantial seasonal  political and other fluctuations 
the price at which the oil and natural gas we produce may be sold is uncertain and it is possible that under some market conditions the production and sale of oil and natural gas from some or all of our properties may not be economical 
because of all of the factors influencing the price of oil and natural gas  it is impossible to accurately predict future prices 
to mitigate the effects of commodity price fluctuations  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel  before transportation costs and differentials  for the period january through february for the period march through december  we were party to forward sales contracts for the sale of  barrels of wcbb production per day at a weighted average daily price of per barrel before transportation costs and differentials 
in november  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel for the period january through december for january through february  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel 
for the period from march through july  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel 
for the period from august through december  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel 
for the period from january through december  we have entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel 
under the contracts  we hedged approximately of our production 
under the contracts  we hedged approximately of our production 
under the contracts  we have hedged approximately of our estimated production 
such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 
in addition  these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil 
these forward sales contracts and fixed price swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value pursuant to fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  and related pronouncements 
regulation regulation of gas and oil production oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation  regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities 
this legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion 
some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we own interests in a number of producing oil and natural gas properties located along the louisiana gulf coast  and in the utica shale in eastern ohio  the niobrara formation in northwestern colorado and the bakken formation in western north dakota and eastern montana 
the states in which our fields are located in regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas  including requirements for obtaining drilling permits  the method of developing new fields and the spacing and operation of wells 
in addition  regulations governing conservation matters aimed at preventing the waste of oil and natural gas resources could affect the rate of production and may include maximum daily production allowables for wells on a market demand or conservation basis 
environmental regulation our oil and natural gas exploration  development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
numerous governmental agencies  such as the us environmental protection agency  or the epa  issue regulations which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non compliance 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands  ecologically sensitive and other protected areas  require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits  result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits  licenses and authorizations  require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relate to our owned or operated facilities 
the strict and joint and several liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon us regardless of fault 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances  hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position  as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general 
our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements 
this trend  however  may not continue in the future 
waste handling 
the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended  or rcra  and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder  affect oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation  transportation  treatment  storage  disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
with federal approval  the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra  sometimes in conjunction with their own  more stringent requirements 
although most wastes associated with the exploration  development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra  such wastes may constitute solid wastes that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non hazardous waste provisions 
however  we cannot assure you that the epa or state or local governments will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non hazardous wastes or categorize some non hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation 
indeed  legislation has been proposed from time to time in congress to re categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration  development and production wastes as hazardous wastes 
any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses 
administrative  civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling  and that we hold all necessary and up to date permits  registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations 
although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes  as presently classified  to be significant  any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes 
remediation of hazardous substances 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended  also known as cercla or the superfund law  and analogous state laws  generally imposes strict and joint and several liability  without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct  on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility  a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination  and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility 
under cercla and comparable state statutes  persons deemed responsible parties may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property 
table of contents 
index to financial statements contamination including groundwater contamination  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
in the course of our operations  we use materials that  if released  would be subject to cercla and comparable state statutes 
therefore  governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under cercla and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been released 
water discharges 
the federal water pollution control act of  as amended  also known as the clean water act  the safe drinking water act  the oil pollution act  or opa  and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants  including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes  into navigable waters of the united states  as well as state waters 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the epa or the state 
the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters  including jurisdictional wetlands  unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit 
spill prevention  control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill  rupture or leak 
these laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers 
the epa has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges 
in addition  on october   the epa announced a schedule to develop pre treatment standards for wastewater discharges produced by natural gas extraction from underground coalbed and shale formations 
the epa stated that it will gather data  consult with stakeholders  including ongoing consultation with industry  and solicit public comment on a proposed rule for coalbed methane in and a proposed rule for shale gas in costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans  as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities 
some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 
the oil pollution act  or opa  is the primary federal law for oil spill liability 
the opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the united states  including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs 
the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict  joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release  including  but not limited to  the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 
noncompliance with the clean water act or opa may result in substantial administrative  civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive obligations 
we believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws 
air emissions 
the federal clean air act  as amended  and comparable state laws and regulations  regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements 
the epa has developed  and continues to develop  stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources 
new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin  and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
for example  on april   the epa approved final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations  which regulations are discussed in more detail under the caption regulation of hydraulic fracturing 
these laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate  and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations 
obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 
climate change 
many nations have agreed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol 
methane  a primary component of natural gas  and carbon dioxide  a byproduct of the burning of oil  natural gas  and refined petroleum products  are greenhouse gases  or ghgs  regulated by the kyoto protocol 
although the united states is not participating in the kyoto protocol at this time  several states or geographic regions have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
additionally  on april   the us supreme court ruled  in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles as air pollutants under the federal clean air act 
thereafter  in december  the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because  according to the epa  emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
subsequently  the epa adopted two sets of related rules  one of which purports to regulate emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities 
the epa finalized the motor vehicle rule  which purports to limit emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles manufactured in model years  in april and it became effective in january  although it does not require immediate reductions in ghg emissions 
a recent rulemaking proposal by the epa and the department of transportation national highway traffic safety administration seeks to expand the motor vehicle rule to include vehicles manufactured in model years the epa adopted the stationary source rule  also known as the tailoring rule  in may  and it also became effective in january  although it remains subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups 
the tailoring rule establishes new ghg emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the prevention of significant deterioration  or psd  and title v programs of the clean air act 
the permitting requirements of the psd program apply only to newly constructed or modified major sources 
obtaining a psd permit requires a source to install best available control technology  or bact  for those regulated pollutants that are emitted in certain quantities 
phase i of the tailoring rule  which became effective on january   requires projects already triggering psd permitting that are also increasing ghg emissions by more than  tons per year to comply with bact rules for their ghg emissions 
phase ii of the tailoring rule  which became effective on july   requires preconstruction permits using bact for new projects that emit  tons of ghg emissions per year or existing facilities that make major modifications increasing ghg emissions by more than  tons per year 
phase iii of the tailoring rule  which is expected to go into effect in  will seek to streamline the permitting process and permanently exclude smaller sources from the permitting process 
additionally  in september  the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us  including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies  beginning in for emissions occurring in in november  the epa expanded its existing ghg reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing  transmission  storage and distribution facilities  which may include certain of our facilities  beginning in for emissions occurring in in addition  the epa has continued to adopt ghg regulations of other industries  such as the march proposed ghg rule restricting future development of coal fired power plants 
the proposed rule underwent an extended public comment process  which concluded on june  the epa is also under a legal obligation pursuant to a consent decree with certain environmental groups to issue new source performance standards for refineries 
the epa has also adopted regulations imposing best available control technology requirements on the largest greenhouse gas stationary sources  regulations requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities  and it is considering additional regulation of greenhouse gases as air pollutants 
as a result of this continued regulatory focus  future ghg regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility 
in addition  the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time  it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions  such as electric power plants  or major producers of fuels  such as refineries and gas processing plants  to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of ghgs 
the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved 
as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year  the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly 
restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry 
currently  while we are subject to certain federal ghg monitoring and reporting requirements  our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal  state and local climate change initiatives and  at this time  it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 
in addition  there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes  thunderstorms  tornadoes and snow or ice storms  as well as rising sea levels 
another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures 
some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages 
extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured 
however  at this time  we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations

index to financial statements regulation of hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations  including shales 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
the federal safe drinking water act  or sdwa  regulates the underground injection of substances through the underground injection control  or uic  program 
hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the uic program  and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
the epa  however  has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the uic program  specifically as class ii uic wells 
at the same time  the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities 
moreover  the epa announced on october  that it is also launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards by that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant 
as part of these studies  the epa has requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
these studies  depending on their results  could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or otherwise 
legislation to amend the sdwa to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing  as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process  were proposed in recent sessions of congress 
the us congress continues to consider legislation to amend the sdwa 
on april   the epa approved final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations 
specifically  the epa rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds  or vocs  and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities 
the final rule includes a reduction in vocs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january  the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors  controllers  dehydrators  storage tanks and other production equipment 
these rules will require a number of modifications to our operations  including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by january  compliance with such rules could result in significant costs  including increased capital expenditures and operating costs  and could adversely impact our business 
in addition  there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturing potential impacts  the results of which are expected between later in and these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory authorities 
the us department of energy is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods 
additionally  certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources  the sec to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale formations by means of hydraulic fracturing  and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency estimates regarding natural gas reserves  including reserves from shale formations  as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 
some states in which we operate or hold oil and natural gas interests have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances and or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids 
for example  in january  the ohio department of natural resources issued a temporary moratorium on the development of hydraulic fracturing disposal wells in northeast ohio  to study the relationship between these wells and minor earthquakes reported in the area 
the texas railroad commission and louisiana department of natural resources recently adopted rules and regulations requiring that well operators disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of federal occupational safety and health act osha to state regulators and on a public internet website 
effective august   montana adopted hydraulic fracturing disclosure regulations under which well operators must provide information in drilling permit applications on the estimated volume and types of materials to be used in the proposed hydraulic fracturing activities 
upon completion of the well  well operators must provide the montana board of oil and gas conservation with the volume and type of chemicals used  including the additive type  chemical ingredient names  and chemical abstracts service  or cas  number  subject to certain trade secret protections 
on april   the north dakota 
table of contents 
index to financial statements industrial commission enacted regulations requiring hydraulic fracturing well operators to disclose the hydraulic fluid composition  including the trade name  supplier  ingredients  cas number  and the maximum ingredient concentrations of all additives in the hydraulic fracturing fluid 
colorado enacted rules requiring similar disclosures on january  also  on may   the us department of interior  or doi  issued a draft rule that seeks to require companies operating on federal and indian lands to i publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process  ii confirm its wells meet certain construction standards and iii establish site plans to manage flowback water 
we plan to use hydraulic fracturing in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal  state  local  foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing or offshore drilling  including legislation and regulation in the states in which we operate  could reduce the volumes of oil and gas that we can economically recover  which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids  impacts on drinking water supplies  use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water  groundwater and the environment generally 
a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices 
if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted  such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
in addition  if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level  our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements  more stringent construction specifications  increased monitoring  reporting and recordkeeping obligations  plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs 
such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs  and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
at this time  it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing 
other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal  state and local authorities 
legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing the regulatory burden 
also  numerous departments and agencies  both federal and state  are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members  some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability  these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types  quantities and locations of production 
the availability  terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas 
the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including regulation of the terms  conditions and rates for interstate transportation  storage and various other matters  primarily by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc 
federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation 
ferc regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 
although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated  congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation 
we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed  what proposals  if any  might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures  and what effect  if any  the proposals might have on our operations 
sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
drilling and production 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local level 
these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
the state  and some counties and municipalities  in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the timing of construction or drilling activities  including seasonal wildlife closures  the rates of production or allowables  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the plugging and abandoning of wells  and notice to  and consultation with  surface owners and other third parties 
state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties 
some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in some instances  forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production 
these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
moreover  each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation  but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future 
the effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells  negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill 
federal  state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells  closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate 
the us army corps of engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment  decommissioning and site restoration 
although the us army corps of engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances  some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements 
natural gas sales and transportation 
historically  federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production 
ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of since  various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales  which include all of our sales of our own production 
under the energy policy act of  ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders  including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties 
ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity  which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce  as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity 
commencing in  ferc promulgated a series of orders  regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas 
today  interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers  marketers and other shippers  regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company 
ferc initiatives have led to the development of a competitive  open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third party sellers other than pipelines 
however  the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect  if any  future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities 
under ferc current regulatory regime  transmission services must be provided on an open access  non discriminatory basis at cost based rates or at market based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive 
gathering service  which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services  is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters 
although its policy is still in flux  ferc has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non jurisdictional gathering facilities  which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to point of sale locations 
oil sales and transportation 
sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices 
nevertheless  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
our crude oil sales are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation 
ferc regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions 
the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation  and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates  varies from state to state 
insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers  we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors 

table of contents 
index to financial statements further  interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non discriminatory basis 
under this open access standard  common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates 
when oil pipelines operate at full capacity  access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines published tariffs 
accordingly  we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors 
state regulation 
the states in which we operate regulate the drilling for  and the production and gathering of  oil and natural gas  including through requirements relating to the method of developing new fields  the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources 
states may also regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from wells based on market demand or resource conservation  or both 
states do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation  but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future 
the effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill 
the petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal  state and local regulations and laws 
some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity 
we do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us 
operational hazards and insurance the oil business involves a variety of operating risks  including the risk of fire  explosions  blow outs  pipe failures and  in some cases  abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases 
if any of these should occur  we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury  loss of life  damage or destruction to property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or environmental damage  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in accordance with what we believe to be industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the operating risks to which our business is exposed 
we insure some  but not all  of our properties for operational and hurricane related events 
we currently have insurance policies that include coverage for general liability  physical damage to our oil and gas properties  operational control of certain wells  oil pollution  third party liability  workers compensation and employers liability and other coverage 
our insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery 
additionally  our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations  and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences  damages and losses 
any of these events could cause a significant disruption to our business 
for example  we experienced production interruptions in and from hurricanes katrina and rita and  in  from hurricanes gustav and ike 
a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse affect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
currently  we have general liability insurance coverage with an annual aggregate limit of up to million which includes environmental impairment coverage for the effects of onshore and offshore pollution on third parties arising from our operations 
for our offshore wcbb properties  we also have a million property physical damage policy which insures against most operational perils  such as explosions  fire  vandalism  theft  hail and windstorms  provided  however  that this policy is limited to million for damages arising as a result of a named windstorm 
in the event of a loss under this policy  we have up to million of business interruption coverage available after a day waiting period 
all of our insurance coverage includes deductibles of up to  per occurrence million in the case of a named windstorm that must be met prior to recovery 
additionally  our insurance is subject to customary exclusions and limitations 
we reevaluate the purchase of insurance  policy terms and limits annually each may 
future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions 
in addition  some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage 
we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations 
this may cause us to restrict our operations  which might severely impact our financial position 
the occurrence of a significant event  not fully insured against  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
at the depths and in the areas in which we operate  and in light of the vertical and directional drilling that we undertake  we typically do not encounter high pressures or extreme drilling conditions 
accordingly  we typically do not carry a control of well policy  although we currently have such coverage in place for five specific southern louisiana wells 
in addition  it is currently anticipated that we will carry control of well coverage for all of our utica shale wells 
we also require all of our third

index to financial statements party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider 
we have prepared and have in place spill prevention control and countermeasure plans for each of our principal facilities at wcbb in response to federal and state requirements 
the plans are reviewed annually and updated as necessary 
as required by applicable regulations  our facilities are built with oil containment features and we own certain oil containment equipment  such as oil boom to surround drill sites and production facilities if needed 
in addition  we have a national emergency response company on retainer 
this company specializes in the clean up of hydrocarbons as a result of spills  blow outs and natural disasters 
this emergency response company has been involved in the clean up efforts of some of the largest oil spills along the gulf coast and is on call to us hours a day when its services are needed 
it has previously reported that it owns over response vehicles  response vessels  response trailers equipped with decontaminant supplies  personal protective equipment and other equipment used in responding to oil spills  two storage barge sets  allowing for storage of up to barrels of recovered oil each  and over roll off boxes and vacuum boxes 
we pay this company a retainer plus additional amounts when it provides us with clean up services 
our aggregate payments for the retainer and clean up services during and were approximately  and  respectively 
while this company has been able to meet our service needs when required from time to time in the past  it is possible that its ability to provide services to us in the future  if and when needed  could be hindered or delayed in the event of a widespread disaster 
however  in light of the depths and the areas in which we operate  and the necessity for gas lift to produce our wcbb wells due to low reservoir pressure at our wcbb field  we believe other companies would be available to us in the event our primary remediation company was unable to perform 
headquarters and other facilities we own an approximately  square foot office building in oklahoma city  oklahoma that serves as our corporate headquarters 
additionally  we lease approximately  square feet of office space in other buildings in oklahoma city 
we also own an approximately  square foot building in lafayette  louisiana 
this building contains approximately  square feet of finished office area and  square feet of clear span warehouse area 
we also lease approximately  square feet in a building in lafayette that we use as our louisiana headquarters 
we lease  square feet of office space in st 
clairsville  ohio that serves as our ohio headquarters 
each of these properties is suitable and adequate for its use 
employees at december   we had employees 
an unrelated louisiana well servicing company provides all necessary field personnel needed to operate the wcbb and the hackberry fields

risk factors risks related to our business and industry the volatility of oil and natural gas prices due to factors beyond our control greatly affects our profitability 
our revenues  operating results  profitability  future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
historically  oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  including worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and natural gas  the expected rates of declining current production  
table of contents 
index to financial statements weather conditions  including hurricanes  and other natural disasters that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  technical advances affecting energy consumption  risks associated with operating drilling rigs  the availability of pipeline capacity and other transportation facilities  the price and level of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts  political or economic instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions  including the middle east  africa  south america and russia  and the overall domestic and global economic environment 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example  during the past five years  the posted price for west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil  which we refer to herein as west texas intermediate or wti  has ranged from a low of per barrel  or bbl  in december to a high of per bbl in july the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of per mmbtu in september to a high of per mmbtu in july during  west texas intermediate prices ranged from to per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from to per mmbtu 
on december   the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was per barrel and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was per mmbtu 
any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves 
in addition  lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
if this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development results deteriorate  full cost accounting rules may require us to write down  as a non cash charge to earnings  the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
declining general economic  business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
concerns over global economic conditions  energy costs  geopolitical issues  inflation  the availability and cost of credit  the european debt crisis  the united states mortgage market and a weak real estate market in the united states have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy 
these factors  combined with volatile prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession 
in addition  continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the united states or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the united states and other countries 
concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices 
if the economic climate in the united states or abroad deteriorates further  worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish  which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  affect the ability of our vendors  suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
our success depends on finding  developing or acquiring additional reserves  which requires significant capital expenditures 
our future success depends upon our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted  except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both 
to increase reserves and production  we undertake development  exploration and other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish these activities 
we have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development  production  exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have financed capital expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations  the issuance of equity securities and borrowings under our bank and other credit facilities 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
we may not have sufficient resources to acquire additional reserves or to undertake exploration  development  production or other replacement activities  such activities may not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and development costs 
furthermore  although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase significantly  our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase 
our failure to successfully identify  complete and integrate future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce our earnings and slow our growth 
there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry 
competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of  or cause us to refrain from  completing acquisitions 
our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and  in some cases  regulatory approvals 
further  these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate  which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations  personnel and facilities 
in addition  if we enter into new geographic markets  we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements 
compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations on us and our management  cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non compliance with such additional legal requirements 
completed acquisitions could require us to invest further in operational  financial and management information systems and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage additional employees 
the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations  which  in turn  could negatively impact our earnings and growth 
our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 
if we are unable to complete capital projects in a timely manner  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
delays related to capital spending programs involving engineering  procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results 
delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce 
such delays may arise as a result of unpredictable factors  many of which are beyond our control  including denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and or permits  unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor  disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters or other events such as equipment malfunctions  explosions  fires or spills affecting our facilities  or those of vendors or suppliers  shortages of sufficiently skilled labor  or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages  market related increases in a project debt or equity financing costs  and nonperformance by  or disputes with  vendors  suppliers  contractors or subcontractors 
any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects 
our canadian oil sands projects are complex undertakings and may not be completed at our estimated cost or at all 
we  through our wholly owned subsidiary grizzly holdings inc  own a interest in grizzly 
the remaining interest in grizzly is owned by grizzly oils sands inc  an entity owned by certain investment funds managed by wexford 
as of december   grizzly had approximately  acres under lease in the athabasca and peace river oil sands regions of alberta  canada 
our total net investment in grizzly was approximately million as of december  as of that date  grizzly had drilled an aggregate of core holes and six water supply test wells on ten separate lease blocks and conducted a number of seismic programs 
in march  grizzly filed an application for the development of an  barrel per day oil sand project at algar lake 
in november  the government of alberta provided a formal order in council authorizing the ercb to issue the formal regulatory approval of grizzly algar lake steam assisted gravity drainage  or sagd  project 
construction of the algar lake phase sagd project commenced in during  an kilometer

index to financial statements road was constructed to the project site  water and natural gas supply pipelines were installed  central plant modules were assembled  transported to the project site and lifted into place  ten production well pairs were drilled and completed and well pad modules and flow lines back to the central plant were installed 
grizzly expects first oil production at algar lake during the third quarter of in the first quarter of  grizzly completed the acquisition of the may river property comprising approximately  acres 
in the fourth quarter of  grizzly initiated a well core hole drilling program at may river and plans to file an initial  barrel per day development application with the ercb by the end of at the thickwood thermal project  grizzly activities included the completion of a well core hole drilling program and the acquisition of kilometers of seismic data 
a development application for a  barrel per day oil sands project at thickwood was filed in the fourth quarter of grizzly anticipates approval of this development application in mid and first oil production by mid grizzly has also entered into a memorandum of understanding that outlines the rate structure for a ten year agreement with canadian national railway company  or cn  to transport its bitumen to the us gulf coast via cn rail network 
grizzly expects that this arrangement will provide consistent access to brent based pricing from grizzly algar lake project 
grizzly is also pursuing the design  permitting and construction of rail terminals in northern alberta and on the lower mississippi river  where it plans to develop scalable capacity to accommodate unit trains to ship and receive up to  barrels per day 
grizzly anticipates beginning to transport the company bitumen starting in the third quarter of these are complex projects and additional financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such financing  if required  could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the unavailability  high cost or shortages of rigs  equipment  raw materials  supplies or personnel may restrict our operations 
the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical  which can result in shortages of drilling rigs  equipment  raw materials particularly sand and other proppants  supplies and personnel 
when shortages occur  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and supplies increase and demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we rely on independent third party service providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells 
if we are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer  and we may not be able to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire 
shortages of drilling rigs  equipment  raw materials particularly sand and other proppants  supplies  personnel  trucking services  tubulars  fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations  which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could disrupt our operations resulting in a loss of revenues 
many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees 
the loss of their services  particularly the loss of mike liddell  our chairman of the board  james d 
palm  our chief executive officer  michael g 
moore  our chief financial officer  or our two geophysicists could disrupt our operations resulting in a loss of revenues 
our executives are not restricted from competing with us if they cease to be employed by us  except under certain limited circumstances prohibiting competition while making use of our trade secrets 
we are party to an employment agreement with each of these executive officers 
as a practical matter  however  employment agreements may not assure the retention of our employees 
further  we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
as a result  we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees 
sec rules that went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after december  could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future 
sec rules that went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after december  require that  subject to limited exceptions  proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking 
this requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program 
moreover  we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required five year timeframe 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are uncertain and may vary substantially from actual production 
there are numerous uncertainties associated with estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of expenditures

information relating to our proved oil and natural gas reserves is based upon engineering estimates 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  future site restoration and abandonment costs  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
estimates of reserves as of year end  and were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field by field basis on the first day of each month within the month period ended december   and  respectively  in accordance with the revised guidelines of the sec applicable to reserves estimates for such years 
reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist  nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage 
the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 
the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net revenue from our proved reserves for  and on an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of prices received on a field by field basis on the first day of each month within the month period ended december   and  respectively  in accordance with the revised guidelines of the sec applicable to reserves estimates for such years 
however  actual future net revenues from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas  the amount and timing of actual production  supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net revenues from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
as of december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and may require successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully  but these assumptions may not be accurate  and this may not occur 
there are numerous uncertainties in estimating quantities of bitumen reserves and resources in connection with our equity investment in grizzly and the indicated level of reserves or recovery of bitumen may not be realized 
there are numerous uncertainties in estimating quantities of bitumen reserves and resources  and the indicated level of reserves or recovery of bitumen may not be realized 
in general  estimates of economically recoverable bitumen reserves and the future net cash flow from such reserves are based upon a number of factors and assumptions made as of the date on which the reserve and resource estimates were determined  such as geological and engineering estimates which have uncertainties  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and estimates of future commodity prices and operating costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
all such estimates are  to some degree  uncertain and classifications of reserves are only attempts to define the degree of uncertainty involved 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable bitumen  the classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues expected therefrom  prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times  may vary substantially 

table of contents 
index to financial statements estimates with respect to reserves and resources that may be developed and produced in the future are often based upon volumetric calculations and upon analogy to similar types of reserves  rather than upon actual production history 
estimates based on these methods generally are less reliable than those based on actual production history 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history may result in variations in the estimated reserves 
reserve and resource estimates may require revision based on actual production experience 
reserve and resources estimates are determined with reference to assumed oil prices and operating costs 
market price fluctuations of oil prices may render uneconomic the recovery of certain grades of bitumen 
the actual gravity or quality of bitumen to be produced from grizzly lands cannot be determined at this time 
the marketability of our production is dependent upon compressors  gathering lines  transportation barges and other facilities  certain of which we do not control 
when these facilities are unavailable  our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas lines and transportation barges owned by third parties 
in general  we do not control these transportation facilities and our access to them may be limited or denied 
a significant disruption in the availability of these transportation facilities or our compression and other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations 
we are at particular risk with respect to oil and natural gas produced at our wcbb field  which is our largest producing field 
in october  for example  a natural gas line in this field operated by our natural gas purchaser was ruptured by a third party contractor  requiring the field to be shut in for approximately seven weeks until the line could be repaired 
further  we are dependent on our oil purchaser to provide the barges necessary to transport our oil production from the wcbb field 
in addition  we currently intend to focus a significant portion of our future exploration and development activity on our utica shale acreage 
historically  there has been no or only limited infrastructure in this area and the commencement of production from our initial wells on our utica shale acreage has been delayed due to challenges in obtaining rights of way and acquiring necessary state and federal permitting 
if we are unable  for any sustained period  to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter compression or other production related difficulties  we will be required to shut in or curtail production from the impacted field s 
any such shut in or curtailment  or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields  would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial portion of our producing properties is located in louisiana  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in this region 
our largest field by production  wcbb  is located approximately five miles off the coast of louisiana in a shallow bay with water depths averaging eight to ten feet 
as a result  we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from this region caused by weather conditions such as fog or rain  hurricanes or other natural disasters or lack of field infrastructure 
losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of any existing insurance coverage 
we may not be able to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will be available 
our identified drilling locations  which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans  are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 
we have identified over drilling locations on our louisiana  ohio and western colorado properties 
these drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties  including the availability of capital  oil and natural gas prices  inclement weather  costs  drilling results and regulatory changes 
because of these uncertainties  we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations 
as such  our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified  which could adversely affect our business 
drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our drilling activities are subject to many risks 
for example  we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 
drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling  operating and other costs 
the seismic data and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically 
the costs of exploration  exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control  and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project 
further  our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed  delayed  canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors  including unusual or unexpected geological formations  loss of drilling fluid circulation  title problems  facility or equipment malfunctions  unexpected operational events  shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements  and adverse weather conditions 
any of these risks can cause substantial losses  including personal injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution  environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties 
operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits 
our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas  including the risk of fire  explosions  blowouts  surface cratering  uncontrollable flows of natural gas  oil and formation water  pipe or pipeline failures  abnormally pressured formations  casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills  gas leaks  ruptures or discharges of toxic gases 
in addition  our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing  including any mishandling  surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids  including chemical additives 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations 
in accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice  we historically have maintained insurance against some  but not all  of our business risks 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities we may suffer 
also  insurance may no longer be available to us or  if it is  its availability may be at premium levels that do not justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant uninsured claim  a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
in addition  we understand that insurance carriers are modifying or otherwise restricting insurance coverage or ceasing to provide certain types of insurance coverage in the gulf coast region 
we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations 
this may cause us to restrict our operations  which might severely impact our financial position 
we may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us  which liabilities may not be covered by insurance 
a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest 
it is our practice in acquiring oil and gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest 
rather  we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a specific mineral interest 
prior to the drilling of an oil or gas well  however  it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to the well 
frequently  as a result of such examinations  certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the marketability of the title  and such curative work entails expense 
our failure to cure any title defects may delay or prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest  which may adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves 
additionally  undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed acreage 
if there are any title defects or defects in the assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest  we will suffer a financial loss

index to financial statements our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 
we acquire significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future 
development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered 
we acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time 
however  we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments 
additionally  we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed  that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells 
drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover the drilling  operating and other costs 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property 
drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions  equipment failures or accidents  shortages of equipment or personnel  environmental issues and for other reasons 
in addition  wells that are profitable may not meet our internal return targets  which are dependent upon the current and expected future market prices for oil and natural gas  expected costs associated with producing oil and natural gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 
drilling results in our newer oil and liquids rich shale plays may be more uncertain than in shale plays that are more developed and have longer established production histories  and we can provide no assurance that drilling and completion techniques that have proven to be successful in other shale formations to maximize recoveries will be ultimately successful when used in newly developed shale formations 
part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques  therefore  the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production 
our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers 
risks that we face while drilling include  but are not limited to  landing our well bore in the desired drilling zone  staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation  running our casing the entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore 
risks that we face while completing our wells include  but are not limited to  being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages  being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage 
the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production 
newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas 
ultimately  the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period 
if our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints  lease expirations  access to gathering systems  and or natural gas and oil prices decline  the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate 
further  as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write downs of our oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future 
we are not the operator of all of our oil and natural gas properties and therefore are not in a position to control the timing of development efforts  the associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves on such properties 
we are not the operator of all of the properties in which we have an interest  and have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of such non operated properties or their associated costs 
dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects  and limited ability to influence operations and associated costs  could prevent the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities 
the success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others will depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control  including the timing and amount of capital expenditures  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the availability of suitable drilling equipment  production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel  the operator expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells  selection of technology  and the rate of production of the reserves 
in addition  when we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular oil or natural gas project  if we are not willing or able to fund our capital expenditures relating to such projects when required by the majority owner or operator  our interests in these projects may be reduced or forfeited 
our undeveloped acreage must be drilled before lease expiration to hold the acreage by production 
in highly competitive markets for acreage  failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage could result in a substantial lease renewal cost or  if renewal is not feasible  loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities 
unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified  the leases for such acreage will expire 
as of december   leases representing    and  respectively  of our total niobrara formation undeveloped acreage are scheduled to expire in    and thereafter 
none of our utica shale acreage leases are scheduled to expire until  at which time of our total utica shale undeveloped acreage as of december  will be subject to expiration  with of such acreage expiring thereafter  although our utica shale leases generally grant us the right to extend these leases for an additional five year period 
the cost to renew such leases may increase significantly  and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
as such  our actual drilling activities may differ materially from our current expectations  which could adversely affect our business 
properties we acquire may not produce as projected  and we may be unable to determine reserve potential  identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities 
acquiring oil and gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics  including recoverable reserves  development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain 
in connection with the assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  but such a review will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well or pipeline 
we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems  such as pipe corrosion  when an inspection is made 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property 
we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
our operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and expensive 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal  state and local governmental regulations that may be changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
from time to time  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas 
in addition  the production  handling  storage  transportation  remediation  emission and disposal of oil and gas  by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal  state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions  including administrative  civil or criminal penalties  permit revocations  requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
moreover  these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for water and air pollution control and solid waste management 
significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us 
we believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue

index to financial statements federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 
hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations  including shales 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
the federal safe drinking water act  or sdwa  regulates the underground injection of substances through the underground injection control  or uic  program 
hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the uic program  and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
the epa  however  has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the uic program  specifically as class ii uic wells 
at the same time  the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices and the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities 
moreover  the epa announced on october  that it is also launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose standards by that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant 
as part of these studies  the epa has requested that certain companies provide them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
these studies  depending on their results  could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or otherwise 
legislation to amend the sdwa to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of underground injection and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing  as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process  were proposed in recent sessions of congress 
the us congress continues to consider legislation to amend the sdwa 
on april   the epa approved final regulations under the federal clean air act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations 
specifically  the epa rule package includes new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds  or vocs  and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities 
the final rule seeks to achieve a reduction in vocs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january  the rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors  controllers  dehydrators  storage tanks and other production equipment 
these rules will require a number of modifications to our operations  including the installation of new equipment to control emissions from our wells by january  compliance with such rules could result in significant costs  including increased capital expenditures and operating costs  and could adversely impact our business 
in addition  there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic fracturing potential impacts  the results of which are expected between later in and these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory authorities 
the us department of energy is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods 
additionally  certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources  the sec to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale formations by means of hydraulic fracturing  and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency estimates regarding natural gas reserves  including reserves from shale formations  as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 
some states in which we operate or hold oil and natural gas interests have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances and or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids 
for example  in january  the ohio department of natural resources issued a temporary moratorium on the development of hydraulic fracturing disposal wells in northeast ohio  to study the relationship between these wells and minor earthquakes reported in the area 
the texas railroad commission and louisiana department of natural resources recently adopted rules and regulations requiring that well operators disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of federal occupational safety and health act osha to state regulators and on a public internet website 
effective august   montana adopted hydraulic fracturing disclosure regulations under which well operators must provide information in drilling permit applications on the estimated volume and types of materials to be used in the proposed hydraulic fracturing activities 
upon completion of the well  well operators must provide the montana board of oil and gas 
table of contents 
index to financial statements conservation with the volume and type of chemicals used  including the additive type  chemical ingredient names  and chemical abstracts service  or cas  number  subject to certain trade secret protections 
on april   the north dakota industrial commission enacted regulations requiring hydraulic fracturing well operators to disclose the hydraulic fluid composition  including the trade name  supplier  ingredients  cas number  and the maximum ingredient concentrations of all additives in the hydraulic fracturing fluid 
colorado enacted rules requiring similar disclosures on january  also  on may   the us department of interior  or doi  issued a draft rule that seeks to require companies operating on federal and indian lands to i publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process  ii confirm its wells meet certain construction standards and iii establish site plans to manage flowback water 
we plan to use hydraulic fracturing in connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased federal  state  local  foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing or offshore drilling  including legislation and regulation in the states in which we operate  could reduce the volumes of oil and gas that we can economically recover  which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
there has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids  impacts on drinking water supplies  use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water  groundwater and the environment generally 
a number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices 
if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted  such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
in addition  if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level  our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements  more stringent construction specifications  increased monitoring  reporting and recordkeeping obligations  plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs 
such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs  and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
at this time  it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing 
our operations may be exposed to significant delays  costs and liabilities as a result of environmental  health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities 
we may incur significant delays  costs and liabilities as a result of federal  state and local environmental  health and safety requirements applicable to our exploration  development and production activities 
these laws and regulations may  among other things i require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions  water discharges  waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling  producing and other operations  ii regulate the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling  fracturing and completion processes  iii limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands  frontier and other protected areas  iv require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits  and or v impose substantial liabilities for spills  pollution or failure to comply with regulatory filings 
in addition  these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production 
these laws and regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  the suspension or revocation of necessary permits  licenses and authorizations  the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and  in some instances  issuance of orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations 
under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability  we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken 
in addition  claims for damages to persons or property  including natural resources  may result from the environmental  health and safety impacts of our operations 
in addition  the risk of accidental and or unpermitted spills or releases from our operations could expose us to significant liabilities  penalties and other sanctions under applicable laws 
in this regard  in november  we and other entities involved in our wcbb field operations received a government subpoena  to which we have responded  for the production of documents and other information related primarily to a discharge of produced water that allegedly was identified by the us coast guard in march moreover  public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
the trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue  resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more

index to financial statements stringent and costly operating  waste handling  disposal and cleanup requirements  our business  prospects  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 
oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife 
seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs  oilfield equipment  services  supplies and qualified personnel  which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed 
these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs 
permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures 
the designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with our business 
the adoption of derivatives legislation by the us congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate and other risks associated with our business 
the us congress adopted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act hr  which  among other provisions  establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market 
the legislation was signed into law by the president on july  in its rulemaking under the legislation  the commodities futures trading commission  or the cftc  has issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents with exemptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions 
the cftc final rule was set aside by the us district court for the district of columbia on september  and remanded to the cftc to resolve ambiguity as to whether statutory requirements for such limits to be determined necessary and appropriate were satisfied 
as a result  the rule has not yet taken effect  although the cftc has indicated that it intends to appeal the court decision and that it believes the dodd frank act requires it to impose position limits 
the impact of such regulations upon our business is not yet clear 
certain of our hedging and trading activities and those of our counterparties may be subject to the position limits  which may reduce our ability to enter into hedging transactions 
in addition  the dodd frank act does not explicitly exempt end users such as us from the requirement to use cleared exchanges  rather than hedging over the counter  and the requirements to post margin in connection with hedging activities 
while it is not possible at this time to predict when the cftc will finalize certain other related rules and regulations  the dodd frank act and related regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities  although whether these requirements will apply to our business is uncertain at this time 
if the regulations ultimately adopted require that we post margin for our hedging activities or require our counterparties to hold margin or maintain capital levels  the cost of which could be passed through to us  or impose other requirements that are more burdensome than current regulations  our hedging would become more expensive and we may decide to alter our hedging strategy 
the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties 
the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our derivative contracts in existence at that time  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
finally  the legislation was intended  in part  to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas 
our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents 
index to financial statements proposed changes to us tax laws  if adopted  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the us president fiscal year budget proposal includes provisions that would  if enacted  make significant changes to us tax laws 
these changes include  but are not limited to  i eliminating the immediate deduction for intangible drilling and development costs  ii eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development  iii the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties  iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures and iv implementing certain international tax reforms 
these proposed changes in the us tax laws  if adopted  or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development  could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the adoption of climate change legislation by congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 
many nations have agreed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol 
methane  a primary component of natural gas  and carbon dioxide  a byproduct of the burning of oil  natural gas  and refined petroleum products  are greenhouse gases  or ghgs  regulated by the kyoto protocol 
although the united states is not participating in the kyoto protocol at this time  several states or geographic regions have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
additionally  on april   the us supreme court ruled  in massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  that the epa has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles as air pollutant under the federal clean air act 
thereafter  in december  the epa issued an endangerment finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because  according to the epa  emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings by the epa allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
subsequently  the epa adopted two sets of related rules  one of which purports to regulate emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities 
the epa finalized the motor vehicle rule  which purports to limit emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles manufactured in model years  in april and it became effective in january  although it does not require immediate reductions in ghg emissions 
a recent rulemaking proposal by the epa and the department of transportation national highway traffic safety administration seeks to expand the motor vehicle rule to include vehicles manufactured in model years the epa adopted the stationary source rule  also known as the tailoring rule  in may  and it also became effective in january  although it remains subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups 
the tailoring rule establishes new ghg emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the prevention of significant deterioration  or psd  and title v programs of the clean air act 
the permitting requirements of the psd program apply only to newly constructed or modified major sources 
obtaining a psd permit requires a source to install best available control technology  or bact  for those regulated pollutants that are emitted in certain quantities 
phase i of the tailoring rule  which became effective on january   requires projects already triggering psd permitting that are also increasing ghg emissions by more than  tons per year to comply with bact rules for their ghg emissions 
phase ii of the tailoring rule  which became effective on july   requires preconstruction permits using bact for new projects that emit  tons of ghg emissions per year or existing facilities that make major modifications increasing ghg emissions by more than  tons per year 
phase iii of the tailoring rule  which is expected to go into effect in  will seek to streamline the permitting process and permanently exclude smaller sources from the permitting process 
additionally  in september  the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us  including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies  beginning in for emissions occurring in in november  the epa expanded its existing ghg reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing  transmission  storage and distribution facilities  which may include certain of our facilities  beginning in for emissions occurring in in addition  the epa has continued to adopt ghg regulations of other industries  such as the march proposed ghg rule restricting future development of coal fired power plants 
the proposed rule underwent an extended public comment process  which concluded on june  the epa is also under a legal obligation pursuant to a consent decree with certain environmental groups to issue new source performance standards for refineries 
the epa has also adopted regulations imposing best available control technology requirements on the largest greenhouse gas stationary sources  regulations requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities  and it is considering additional regulation of greenhouse gases as air pollutants 
as a result of this continued regulatory focus  future ghg regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  the us congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
although the us congress has not adopted such legislation at this time  it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions  such as electric power plants  or major producers of fuels  such as refineries and gas processing plants  to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of ghgs 
the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved 
as the number of ghg emission allowances declines each year  the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly 
restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry 
currently  while we are subject to certain federal ghg monitoring and reporting requirements  our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal  state and local climate change initiatives and  at this time  it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business 
in addition  there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes  thunderstorms  tornadoes and snow or ice storms  as well as rising sea levels 
another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures 
some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages 
extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured 
however  at this time  we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations 
a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal  state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets  which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 
section b of the natural gas act of  or the nga  exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc 
we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore is exempt from ferc jurisdiction under the nga 
however  the distinction between ferc regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is a fact based determination 
the classification of facilities as unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation  so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc  the courts or congress  which could cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  ferc has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non ferc jurisdictional facilities to ferc annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time 
failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face extensive competition in our industry 
the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive  and we compete with other companies that have greater resources 
many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas  but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional  national or worldwide basis 
these competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of industry opportunities and to withstand changes affecting the industry  such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production  the availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulation 
we depend upon a limited number of customers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production 
the loss of one or more of these purchasers could  among other factors  limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce 
the availability of a ready market for any oil and or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management  including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil  the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines  the availability of skilled labor  materials and equipment  the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of gas sold in interstate commerce 
the oil and natural gas we produce in

shell has agreed to purchase our utica oil  and we have agreements in place with various purchasers for our utica natural gas production 
we may not continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production 
our method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  all costs  including nonproductive costs and certain general and administrative costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  are capitalized 
net capitalized costs are limited to the estimated future net revenues  after income taxes  discounted at per year  from proven oil and natural gas reserves and the cost of the properties not subject to amortization 
such capitalized costs  including the estimated future development costs and site remediation costs  if any  are depleted by an equivalent units of production method  converting gas to barrels at the ratio of six mcf of gas to one barrel of oil 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of the oil and gas properties 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month prices for  and adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives  if any  that hedge oil and natural gas revenue  excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet  b the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized  less income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties 
if the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash writedown is required 
a ceiling test impairment can give us a significant loss for a particular period 
once incurred  a write down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date  even if oil or gas prices increase 
if prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids decrease  we may be required to further write down the value of our oil and gas properties 
future non cash asset impairments could negatively affect our results of operations 
our use of d and d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas  which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations 
even when properly used and interpreted  d and d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are  in fact  present in those structures 
in addition  the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies  and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures 
as a result  our drilling activities may not be successful or economical 
we have entered into forward sales contracts and fixed price swaps and may in the future enter into additional contracts for a portion of our production  which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and gas

under the contracts  we hedged approximately of our production 
under the contracts  we hedged approximately of our production 
under the contracts  we have hedged approximately of our estimated production 
such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 
in addition  these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil 
these forward sales contracts and fixed price swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value pursuant to fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  and related pronouncements 
our hedging transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk 
our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract 
disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty liquidity  which could make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the derivative contract 
a terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the united states or other countries may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
if any of these events occur  the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas  potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues 
oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks  and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers operations is destroyed or damaged 
costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats  and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain  if available at all 
conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas 
fuel conservation measures  alternative fuel requirements  increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas  technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas 
the impact of the changing demand for oil and gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business 
we are dependent on our information systems and computer based programs  including our well operations information  seismic data  electronic data processing and accounting data 
if any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure  possible consequences include our loss of communication links  inability to find  produce  process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities 
any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks relating to our indebtedness our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
as of december   we had total indebtedness net of associated accrued discount and premium of approximately million  including million attributable to the notes  and borrowing base availability of million under our secured revolving credit facility  under which no borrowings are outstanding 
our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences to you  including the following 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our high level of indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  and any failure to comply with the obligations under any of our debt instruments  including restrictive covenants  could result in a default under our secured revolving credit facility or the senior note indenture  the restrictions imposed on the operation of our business by the terms of our debt agreements may hinder our ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow our business  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  restructuring  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  which could be exacerbated by further volatility in the credit markets  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on the notes and our other indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes  our high level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited  our high level of indebtedness makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  and we may be vulnerable to interest rate increases  as our borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility are at variable interest rates 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
in addition  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal  premium  if any  or interest on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants  including financial and operating covenants  in the instruments governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness 
in the event of such default  the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
more specifically  the lenders under our secured revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments  cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy or litigation 
we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination 
in connection with the contribution and the notes offerings  our borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit facility was reduced to million 
the borrowing base is expected to be redetermined by the lenders on a semiannual basis 
additionally  the required lenders will be able to request one additional borrowing base redetermination in between scheduled redeterminations  and also have the right to redetermine the borrowing base upon the amendment  modification or termination of any swap contract or forward sales contract 
in addition  our borrowing base will be reduced in connection with certain asset dispositions 
we repaid all borrowings outstanding under our secured revolving credit facility approximately million with a portion of the proceeds from the october notes offering 
we currently have no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  although we intend to reborrow under this facility in the future 
if the outstanding borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such recalculation  we would be required to eliminate this excess 
if we are forced to repay a portion of our bank borrowings  we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments 
if we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing  we may have to sell significant assets 
any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash  and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance  which is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures 
if we are unable to generate such cash flow  we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that 
table of contents 
index to financial statements may be onerous or highly dilutive 
in the absence of such cash flows  we could have substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations 
our secured revolving credit facility and the senior note indenture restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales 
we may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair  and proceeds that we do receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time 
we may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms  which could result in a default on our debt obligations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
despite our current leverage  we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness 
this could further exacerbate the risks that we and our subsidiaries face 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future  either under our senior secured credit facility or otherwise 
the terms of our secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  but in each case do not completely prohibit us from doing so 
in addition  the indenture governing the notes allows us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors 
the indenture governing the notes allows us to incur certain other additional secured debt and will allow our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes to incur additional debt 
in addition  the indenture governing the notes does not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness 
if new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify 
restrictive covenants in our secured revolving credit facility  in the senior note indenture and in future debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our secured revolving credit facility and the senior note indenture limit  and the terms of any future indebtedness may limit  our ability  among other things  to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  make certain investments  declare or pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock  prepay subordinated indebtedness  sell assets including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries  agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  enter into transactions with our affiliates  incur liens  engage in business other than the oil and gas business  and designate certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
the restrictions contained in these agreements could limit our ability to plan for  or react to  market conditions  meet capital needs  make acquisitions or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans 
a breach of any of these restrictive covenants could result in default under the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility 
if default occurs  the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable  which would result in an event of default under the senior note indenture 
the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings 
if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due  the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness 
if the indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility and the notes were to be accelerated  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 
risks related to our common stock if our quarterly revenues and operating results fluctuate significantly  the price of our common stock may be volatile 
our revenues and operating results may in the future vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly results fluctuate  it may cause our stock price to be volatile 
we believe that a number of factors could cause these fluctuations  including 
table of contents 
index to financial statements changes in oil and natural gas prices  changes in production levels  changes in governmental regulations and taxes  geopolitical developments  the level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas  and conditions in the oil and natural gas industry and the overall economic environment 
because of the factors listed above  among others  we believe that our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
it is also possible that in some future quarters  our operating results will fall below our expectations or the expectations of market analysts and investors 
if we do not meet these expectations  the price of our common stock may decline significantly 
we do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the future 
we have paid no cash dividends on our common stock  and we may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future 
we intend to retain any earnings to fund our operations 
therefore  we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the terms of our credit agreement prohibit the payment of any dividends to the holders of our common stock 
a change of control could limit our use of net operating losses 
as of december   we had a net operating loss  or nol  carry forward of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
transfers of our stock in the future could result in an ownership change 
in such a case  our ability to use the nols generated through the ownership change date could be limited 
in general  the amount of nols we could use for any tax year after the date of the ownership change would be limited to the value of our stock as of the ownership change date multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
we have registered a substantial number of shares of our common stock under a registration statement filed with the sec 
sales of these shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  sales by certain of our stockholders of their shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of common or preferred stock 
as of february   there were  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding  excluding  shares of unvested restricted stock awarded under our amended and restated stock incentive plan and  shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options to purchase our common stock granted under our amended and restated stock incentive plan 
we could issue preferred stock which could be entitled to dividend  liquidation and other special rights and preferences not shared by holders of our common stock or which could have anti takeover effects 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  par value per share 
shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series as our board of directors  by resolution or resolutions  may from time to time determine each such series to be distinctively designated 
the voting powers  preferences and relative  participating  optional and other special rights  and the qualifications  limitations or restrictions  if any  of each such series of preferred stock may differ from those of any and all other series of preferred stock at any time outstanding  and  subject to certain limitations of our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law  or dgcl  our board of directors may fix or alter  by resolution or resolutions  the designation  number  voting powers  preferences and relative  participating  optional and other special rights  and qualifications  limitations and restrictions thereof  of each such series preferred stock 
the issuance of any such preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock and  therefore  could reduce the value of our common stock 
in addition  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with  or sell our assets to  a third party 
the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock could discourage  delay or prevent a takeover of us  thereby preserving control of the company by the current stockholders

proved oil and natural gas reserves sec rule making activity in december  the sec released its final rule for modernization of oil and gas reporting 
these rules require disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area  using the arithmetic month average beginning of the month price for the year  as opposed to year end prices as had previously been required unless contractual arrangements designate the price to be used 
other significant amendments included the following disclosure of unproved reserves probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis 
proved undeveloped reserve guidelines reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
reserves estimation using new technologies reserves may be estimated through the use of reliable technology in addition to flow tests and production history 
reserves personnel and estimation process additional disclosure is required regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the reserves estimation process 
we are also required to provide a general discussion of our internal controls used to assure the objectivity of the reserves estimate 
non traditional resources the definition of oil and gas producing activities has expanded and focuses on the marketable product rather than the method of extraction 
we adopted the rules effective december   as required by the sec 
evaluation and review of reserves 
reserve estimates at december  were prepared by nsai with respect to our wcbb  hackberry and niobrara fields of our proved reserves at december   by ryder scott with respect to our assets in the utica shale in eastern ohio of our proved reserves at december  and by our personnel with respect to our overriding royalty and non operated interests less than of our proved reserves at december  
nsai and ryder scott are independent petroleum engineering firms 
copies of their summary reserve reports are included as exhibit and  respectively  to this annual report on form k 
the technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications  independence  objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
our independent third party engineers do not own an interest in any of our properties and are not employed by us on a contingent basis 
we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who work closely with nsai and ryder scott  our independent reserve engineers  to ensure the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our wcbb  hackberry and niobrara fields and our assets in the utica shale 
our internal technical team members meet with nsai and ryder scott periodically throughout the year to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process 
we provide historical information to nsai and ryder scott for our properties such as ownership interest  oil and gas production  well test data  commodity prices and operating and development costs 
our proved reserves attributable to our other minority interests are prepared internally by our internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals 
our chief reserve engineer is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates 
he is a petroleum engineer with over years of reservoir and operations experience and our geophysical staff has

our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest  oil and gas production  well test data  commodity prices and operating and development costs 
our proved reserve estimates are prepared in accordance with our internal control procedures 
these procedures  which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations  include the following review and verification of historical production data  which data is based on actual production as reported by us  preparation of reserve estimates by our experienced reservoir engineers or under their direct supervision  review by our reservoir engineering department of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter  including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions  direct reporting responsibilities by our reservoir engineering department to our chief executive officer  and verification of property ownership by our land department

the reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual future production  cash flows  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates 
represents present value  discounted at per annum  of estimated future net revenue before income tax of our estimated proven reserves 
the estimated future net revenues set forth above were determined by using reserve quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on certain prevailing economic conditions 
the estimated future production in our reserve reports for the years ended december   and is priced based on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period january through december of the applicable year  using per barrel and per mmbtu for  per barrel and per mmbtu for and per barrel and per mmbtu for  and in each case adjusted by lease for transportation fees and regional price differentials 
pv is a non gaap measure because it excludes income tax effects 
management believes that the presentation of the non gaap financial measure of pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and gas companies 
pv is not a measure of financial or operating performance under gaap 
pv should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as defined under gaap 
we have included a reconciliation of pv to the most directly comparable gaap measure standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
the following table reconciles the standardized measure of future net cash flows to the pv value 
table of contents 
index to financial statements december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at pv value the standardized measure represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  less future development  abandonment  production  and income tax expenses  discounted at per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate pv standardized measure differs from pv because standardized measure includes the effect of future income taxes

for further discussion of our interest in tatex ii  tatex iii and grizzly  see item business our equity investments 
the foregoing reserves are all located within the continental united states 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation 
as a result  the estimates of different engineers often vary 
in addition  the results of drilling  testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates 
accordingly  reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions  all of which may vary from actual results  including geologic interpretation  prices and future production rates and costs

item legal proceedings the louisiana department of revenue  or ldr  is disputing our severance tax payments to the state of louisiana from the sale of oil under fixed price contracts during the years through the ldr maintains that we paid approximately million less in severance taxes under fixed price terms than the severance taxes we would have had to pay had we paid severance taxes on the oil at the contracted market rates only 
we have denied any liability to the ldr for underpayment of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements severance taxes and have maintained that we were entitled to enter into the fixed price contracts with unrelated third parties and pay severance taxes based upon the proceeds received under those contracts 
we have maintained our right to contest any final assessment or suit for collection if brought by the state 
on april   the ldr filed a lawsuit in the th judicial district court  lafayette parish  in louisiana against our company seeking  in severance taxes  plus interest and court costs 
we filed a response denying any liability to the ldr for underpayment of severance taxes and are defending our company in the lawsuit 
the ldr had taken no further action on this lawsuit since filing its petition other than propounding discovery requests to which we have responded 
since serving discovery requests on the ldr and received the ldr responses in  there has been no further activity on the case and no trial date has been set 
in december  the ldr filed two identical lawsuits against us in different venues to recover allegedly underpaid severance taxes on crude oil for the period january  through december   together with a claim for attorney fees 
the petitions do not make any specific claim for damages or unpaid taxes 
as with the first lawsuit filed by the ldr in  we have denied all liability and will vigorously defend the lawsuit 
the cases are in the very early stages  and we have not yet filed a response to these lawsuits 
recently  the ldr filed motions to stay the lawsuits before we filed any responsive pleadings 
the ldr has advised us that it intends to pursue settlement discussions with us and other similarly situated defendants in separate proceedings  but has taken no action to initiate settlement talks 
there has been no activity on either of these lawsuits for two years 
in november  cudd pressure control  inc  or cudd  filed a lawsuit against us  great white pressure control llc  or great white  and six former cudd employees in the th judicial district harris county  texas 
the lawsuit was subsequently removed to the united states district court for the southern district of texas houston division 
the lawsuit alleged rico violations and several other causes of action relating to great white employment of the former cudd employees and sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief 
on stipulation by the parties  the plaintiff rico claim was dismissed without prejudice by order of the court on february  we filed a motion for summary judgment on october  the court entered a final interlocutory judgment in favor of all defendants  including us  on april  on november   cudd filed its appeal with the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
the fifth circuit vacated the district court decision finding  among other things  that the district court should not have entered summary judgment without first allowing more discovery 
the case was remanded to the district court  and cudd filed a motion to remand the case to the original state court  which motion was granted 
cudd subsequently filed amended petitions with the state court a alleging  among other things  that we conspired with the other defendants to misappropriate  and misappropriated cudd trade secrets and caused its employees to breach their fiduciary duties  and b seeking monetary damages  including million as a reasonable royalty for the alleged use of its trade secrets 
cudd also sought disgorgement of the alleged benefits received by the various defendants 
cudd also sought its attorney fees  which cudd claimed were not less than  plus of any final judgment 
this case went to trial on september  and on september  the jury rendered its verdict  awarding no damages to the plaintiffs 
we along with all defendants filed a motion for entry of judgment that is consistent with the jury verdict 
cudd filed an application for disgorgement and a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
the court denied all of cudd post trial motions on october   the court issued its final judgment on january  on that same day  cudd filed motions for a new trial and to modify  correct or reform the judgment 
those motions remain pending

plaintiffs allege that the defendants conducted  directed and participated in various oil and gas exploration and production activities on their property which allegedly have contaminated or otherwise caused damage to the property  and have sued the defendants for alleged breaches of oil  gas and mineral leases  as well as for alleged negligence  trespass  failure to warn  strict liability  punitive damages  lease liability  contract liability  unjust enrichment  restoration damages  assessment and response costs and stigma damages 
on december   we were served with a copy of the plaintiffs first supplemental and amending petition which added four additional plaintiffs and six additional defendants  including us  bringing the total number of defendants to it also increased the total acreage at issue in this litigation from acres to approximately  acres 
in addition to the damages sought in the original petition  the plaintiffs now also seek damages sufficient to cover the cost of conducting a comprehensive environmental assessment of all present and yet unidentified pollution and contamination of their property  the cost to restore the property to its pre polluted original condition  damages for mental anguish and annoyance  discomfort and inconvenience caused by the nuisance created by defendants  land loss and subsidence damages and the cost of backfilling canals and other excavations  damages for loss of use of land and lost profits and income  attorney fees and expenses  and damages for evaluation and remediation of any contamination that threatens groundwater

overview we are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with our principal producing properties located along the louisiana gulf coast in the west cote blanche bay  or wcbb  and hackberry fields and in the utica shale in eastern ohio 
during  we acquired our initial acreage position in the niobrara formation of northwestern colorado and  during  we acquired our initial acreage position in the utica shale in eastern ohio 
we also hold a significant acreage position in the alberta oil sands in canada through our interest in grizzly oil sands ulc  or grizzly  a equity interest in diamondback energy  inc  or diamondback  a nasdaq global select market listed company to which we contributed our permian basin oil and gas interests in october immediately prior to diamondback initial public offering  or the diamondback ipo see item business recent developments contribution above  and have interests in entities that operate in southeast asia  including the phu horm gas field in thailand 
we seek to achieve reserve growth and increase our cash flow through our annual drilling programs 
and year to date highlights oil and natural gas revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  production increased to approximately  barrels of oil equivalent  or boe  for the year ended december  from approximately  boe for the year ended december  during  we drilled gross net wells  which included gross net wells drilled by our operators in the permian basin  the niobrara formation and the bakken formation 
in addition  gross one net wells were drilled by another operator on our utica shale acreage during during we recompleted gross net wells 
of our new wells drilled  were completed as producing wells and eight were non productive and  at year end  were waiting on completion and four were drilling 
during and  we acquired leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres in the utica shale in eastern ohio  including the approximately  net acres acquired in december in february  we acquired approximately  additional net acres in the utica shale 
we spud our first well on our utica shale acreage in february and  as of february   had spud wells  of which three were producing  seven had been completed  four were waiting on completion and two were being drilled 
in october  we contributed to diamondback  prior to the closing of the diamondback ipo  all of our oil and natural gas interests in the permian basin for shares of diamondback common stock and a promissory note  which was repaid to us at the closing of the diamondback ipo 
as of october   following the closing of the diamondback ipo and the underwriters exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock of diamondback  we owned approximately of diamondback outstanding common stock 
in october and december of  we issued a total of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million  a portion of which we used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include funding a portion of our capital development plan

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates including those related to oil and natural gas properties  revenue recognition  income taxes and commitments and contingencies  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements oil and natural gas properties 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  all costs  including non productive costs and certain general and administrative costs directly associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  are capitalized 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of the oil and gas properties 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the month unweighted average of the first day of the month price for the period  and  adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives  if any  that hedge our oil and natural gas revenue  and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet  b the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized  including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties 
if the net book value  including related deferred taxes  exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash writedown is required 
such capitalized costs  including the estimated future development costs and site remediation costs of proved undeveloped properties are depleted by an equivalent units of production method  converting gas to barrels at the ratio of six mcf of gas to one barrel of oil 
no gain or loss is recognized upon the disposal of oil and natural gas properties  unless such dispositions significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proven oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas properties not subject to amortization consist of the cost of undeveloped leaseholds and totaled million at december  and million at december  these costs are reviewed quarterly by management for impairment  with the impairment provision included in the cost of oil and natural gas properties subject to amortization 
factors considered by management in its impairment assessment include our drilling results and those of other operators  the terms of oil and natural gas leases not held by production and available funds for exploration and development 
ceiling test 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of the oil and gas properties 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the month unweighted average of the first day of the month price for the period january december of the applicable year beginning with  adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives  if any  that hedge our oil and natural gas revenue  and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet  b the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved 
table of contents 
index to financial statements properties included in the cost being amortized  including related deferred taxes for differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties 
if the net book value  including related deferred taxes  exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash writedown is required 
ceiling test impairment can give us a significant loss for a particular period  however  future depletion expense would be reduced 
a decline in oil and gas prices may result in an impairment of oil and gas properties 
for instance  as a result of the drop in commodity prices on december  and subsequent reduction in our proved reserves  we recognized a ceiling test impairment of million for the year ended december  if prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids decline  we may be required to further write down the value of our oil and gas properties  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
no ceiling test impairment was required for the year ended december  asset retirement obligations 
we have obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and associated production facilities 
we account for abandonment and restoration liabilities under fasb asc which requires us to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset 
the asset retirement liability is recorded in the period in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability  which is generally when the asset is placed into service 
when the liability is initially recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by an amount equal to the original liability 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long lived asset 
upon settlement of the liability or the sale of the well  the liability is reversed 
these liability amounts may change because of changes in asset lives  estimated costs of abandonment or legal or statutory remediation requirements 
the fair value of the liability associated with these retirement obligations is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of the plugging and abandonment or retirement  annual inflations of these costs  the productive life of the asset and our risk adjusted cost to settle such obligations discounted using our credit adjustment risk free interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of most of our oil and natural gas assets  the costs to ultimately retire these assets may vary significantly from previous estimates 
oil and gas reserve quantities 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
nsai  ryder scott and to a lesser extent our personnel have prepared reserve reports of our reserve estimates at december  on a well by well basis for our properties 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with sec guidelines 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
therefore  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas eventually recovered 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income during the period the rate change is enacted 
deferred tax assets are recognized in the year in which realization becomes determinable 
periodically  management performs a forecast of its taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is needed  looking at both positive and negative factors 
a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is established  if in management opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realized 
at 
table of contents 
index to financial statements december   a valuation allowance of million had been provided for state net operating loss and federal tax credit deferred tax assets based on the uncertainty these assets may be realized 
revenue recognition 
we derive almost all of our revenue from the sale of crude oil and natural gas produced from our oil and gas properties 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment on substantially all of these sales from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers that month and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment received for all prior months are recorded at the end of the quarter after payment is received 
historically  our actual payments have not significantly deviated from our accruals 
investments equity method 
investments in entities greater than and less than are accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method  our share of investees earnings or loss is recognized in the statement of operations 
in accordance with fasb asc  financial instruments  we have elected the fair value option of accounting for our equity method investment in diamondback stock 
at the end of each reporting period  the quoted closing market price of diamondback stock is multiplied by the total shares owned by us and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in income loss from equity method investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
we review our investments to determine if a loss in value which is other than a temporary decline has occurred 
if such loss has occurred  we recognize an impairment provision 
there was no impairment of equity method investments at december  or commitments and contingencies 
liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we are involved in certain litigation for which the outcome is uncertain 
changes in the certainty and the ability to reasonably estimate a loss amount  if any  may result in the recognition and subsequent payment of legal liabilities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we seek to reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in oil prices by utilizing energy swaps and collars  or fixed price contracts 
we follow the provisions of fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  as amended 
it requires that all derivative instruments be recognized as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
we estimate the fair value of all derivative instruments using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  correlation between index prices and our realized prices  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
designation is established at the inception of a derivative  but re designation is permitted 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and meeting the effectiveness guidelines of fasb asc  changes in fair value are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
we recognize any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness immediately in earnings

capital expenditures 
our recent capital commitments have been primarily for the execution of our drilling programs  for acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests in the utica shale  permian basin and the niobrara formation  to fund grizzly delineation drilling program and initial preparation of the algar lake facility and for investments in entities that may provide services to facilitate the development of our acreage 
our strategy is to continue to increase cash flow generated from our operations by undertaking new drilling  workover  sidetrack and recompletion projects to exploit our existing properties  subject to economic and industry conditions  and pursue acquisition and disposition opportunities and business integration opportunities 
of our net reserves at december   were categorized as proved undeveloped 
our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted  except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved developed reserves  or both 
to realize reserves and increase production  we must continue our exploratory drilling  undertake other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish those activities 
at december   our booked inventory of prospects included approximately drilling locations at wcbb 
the drilling schedule used in our december  reserve report anticipates that all of those wells will be drilled by the end of during  we recompleted wells and drilled wells  of which were completed as producers and four were non productive  for an aggregate cost of million

our total capital expenditures for are currently estimated to be in the range of million to million  excluding the acquisition costs associated with our february utica shale acquisition and with any additional utica shale acreage or other potential acquisitions and any amounts attributable to grizzly 
approximately of our estimated capital expenditures are currently expected to be spent in the utica shale 
this range is up from the million spent on activities primarily due to the significant increase in our acreage position in the utica shale and our contemplated utica development plans  although such anticipated expenditures are partially offset relative to by the elimination of development costs in the permian basin as a result of the contribution 
we intend to continue to monitor pricing and cost developments and make adjustments to our future capital expenditure programs as warranted 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flow from operations  proceeds from our recent offerings of debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our normal recurring operating needs and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
in the event we elect to further expand or accelerate our drilling programs  pursue additional acquisitions  exercise our blackhawk option or accelerate our canadian oil sands project  we may be required to obtain additional funds which we would seek to do through traditional borrowings  offerings of debt or equity securities or other means  including the sale of assets

if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we may be required to delay or curtail implementation of our business plan or not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us 
commodity price risk the volatility of the energy markets makes it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example  during the past five years  the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of per barrel in december to a high of per barrel in july the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of per million british thermal units  or mmbtu  in september to a high of per mmbtu in july on december   the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was per barrel and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was per mmbtu 
any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves  and may result in write downs of oil and natural gas properties due to ceiling test limitations 
to mitigate the effects of commodity price fluctuations  in november  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel for the period january through december for january through february  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel 
for the period from march through july  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of per barrel 
for the period from august through december  we entered into fixed price swaps for  barrels of oil per day at a weighted average price of

such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 
these fixed price swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value pursuant to fasb asc and related pronouncements 
commitments in connection with the acquisition in of the remaining interest in the wcbb properties  we assumed the seller chevron obligation to contribute approximately  per month through march  to a plugging and abandonment trust and the obligation to plug a minimum of wells per year for years commencing march  chevron retained a security interest in production from these properties until abandonment obligations to chevron have been fulfilled 
beginning in  we can access the trust for use in plugging and abandonment charges associated with the property 
as of december   the plugging and abandonment trust totaled approximately million 
at december   we have plugged wells at wcbb since we began our plugging program in  which management believes fulfills our current minimum plugging obligation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues  operating results  profitability  future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
historically  oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors  including worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and natural gas  the expected rates of declining current production  weather conditions  including hurricanes  that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  technical advances affecting energy consumption  risks associated with operating drilling rigs  the availability of pipeline capacity  the price and level of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions  and the overall economic environment 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example  during the past five years  the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of per barrel  or bbl  in december to a high of per bbl in july the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of per mmbtu in september to a high of per mmbtu in july on february   the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was per barrel and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was per mmbtu

these fixed price swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and recorded at fair value pursuant to fasb asc and related pronouncements 
at december   we had a net liability derivative position of million as compared to a net asset derivative position of million as of december   related to our fixed price swaps 
utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in underlying commodity prices would have reduced the fair value of these instruments by approximately million  while a decrease in underlying commodity prices would have increased the fair value of these instruments by approximately million 
however  any realized derivative gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase  respectively  in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument 
our revolving credit facility is structured under floating rate terms  as advances under this facility may be in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
as such  our interest expense is sensitive to fluctuations in the prime rates in the us or  if the eurodollar rates are elected  the eurodollar rates 
as of october  the latest date during the year ended december  on which we had borrowings outstanding  amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility bore interest at the eurodollar rate of 
as of december   we had no variable interest rate borrowings outstanding  therefore  an increase in interest rates would not have impacted our interest expense 
as of december   we did not have any interest rate swaps to hedge our interest risks
