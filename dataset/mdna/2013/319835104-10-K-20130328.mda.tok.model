item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview first community corporation is a one bank holding company headquartered in lexington  south carolina 
we operate from our main office in lexington  south carolina  and our full service offices located in lexington two  forest acres  irmo  cayce west columbia  gilbert  chapin  northeast columbia  prosperity  newberry and camden  south carolina 
during the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of dekalb bankshares  inc  the holding company for the bank of camden 
the merger added one office in kershaw county located in the midlands of south carolina 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our first acquisition of another financial institution when we merged with dutchfork bancshares  inc  the holding company for newberry federal savings bank 
the merger added three offices in newberry county 
in  our college street office in newberry was consolidated with our wilson road office in newberry 
on september   the company completed the acquisition of two financial planning and investment advisory firms  eah financial group and pooled resources  llc 
in addition  the bank expanded its residential mortgage business unit with the acquisition of the assets of palmetto south mortgage corporation palmetto south  effective july  palmetto south  which operates as a division of the bank  offers mortgage loan products for home purchase or refinance in the south carolina market area 
we engage in a general commercial and retail banking business characterized by personalized service and local decision making  emphasizing the banking needs of small to medium sized businesses  professional concerns and individuals 
the following discussion describes our results of operations for  as compared to and  and also analyzes our financial condition as of december   as compared to december  like most community banks  we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments 
a primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
we have included a number of tables to assist in our description of these measures 
for example  the average balances table shows the average balance during  and of each category of our assets and liabilities  as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category 
a review of this table shows that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest earning assets  which is why we intend to channel a substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio 
similarly  the rate volume analysis table helps demonstrate the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities during the years shown 
we also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  and we have included a sensitivity analysis table to help explain this 
finally  we have included a number of tables that provide detail about our investment securities  our loans  and our deposits and other borrowings 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings 
in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses and the allocation of this allowance among our various categories of loans 

table of contents in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers 
we describe the various components of this noninterest income  as well as our noninterest expense  in the following discussion 
the discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report 
recent developments following a on site examination of the bank  the occ notified the bank that  effective june   the bank was no longer subject to the formal agreement that it entered into with the occ in the occ also notified the bank that  effective june   it was no longer subject to the individual minimum capital ratios established for the bank on february   which had required the bank to maintain a tier leverage capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
the general regulatory minimums to be well capitalized are a tier leverage capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
these regulatory capital ratios for the bank were  and  respectively  as of december  the bank is well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
in addition  the federal reserve bank of richmond notified the company that  effective july   the company is no longer subject to the mou that it had entered into with the federal reserve bank of richmond in december of on july   the company closed a public offering of common stock 
the offering resulted in the issuance of a total of  shares of common stock at per share  including  shares granted to the underwriters to cover overallotments  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds were approximately million after deducting underwriting  discount  commissions and other estimated expenses 
on august   we repurchased million of our series t preferred stock from the treasury through a modified dutch auction process 
this represented  shares of the original  shares of preferred stock sold to the treasury in november pursuant to the tarp cpp 
the remaining  shares of series t preferred stock were purchased in this same auction by third party investors unrelated to the company 
the auction price was per share  which we believe was the highest price paid through that date for a company shares in the treasury tarp preferred stock auctions 
between september  and october   we repurchased or redeemed the remaining shares of series t preferred stock from the third party investors at par 
the repurchase amount  including those repurchased directly from the treasury  included related non recurring expenses in the amount of thousand including attorney costs  accounting costs  and treasury underwriter costs 
in addition  we recorded a charge for the remaining discount accretion of approximately thousand 
on october   we completed a planned conversion from a national bank charter to a south carolina state bank charter as a non member bank 
it is anticipated that this conversion will reduce certain regulatory examination costs in the future 
on october   the treasury accepted our bid to repurchase the cpp warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock issued to the treasury pursuant to the tarp cpp 
the repurchase price agreed upon was  and the transaction was completed in the fourth quarter of the settlement of the cpp warrant completely eliminated the treasury equity stake in the company through the tarp cpp 

table of contents on november   we redeemed the million of outstanding subordinated debt at par which was issued in november critical accounting policies we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
we consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgment and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions we make  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of our allowance for loan losses include judgments about the credit worthiness of borrowers  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the assumptions about cash flow  determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses  the impact of current events  and conditions  and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses 
under different conditions or using different assumptions  the actual amount of credit losses incurred by us may be different from management estimates provided in our consolidated financial statements 
refer to the portion of this discussion that addresses our allowance for loan losses for a more complete discussion of our processes and methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses 
the evaluation and recognition of other than temporary impairment otti on certain investments including our private label mortgage backed securities requires significant judgment and estimates 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the evaluation of otti include projected cash flows including prepayment assumptions  default rates and severities of losses on the underlying collateral within the security 
under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions  the actual otti recognized by us may be different from the actual amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the financial statements for the disclosure of certain of the assumptions used as well as otti recognized in the financial statements during the years ended december   and results of operations our net income was million  or diluted earnings per common share  for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million  or diluted earnings per common share  for the year ended december  during  we continued to control our growth in assets by reducing funding from fhlb borrowings and certificates of deposits greater than  we were able to grow loans excluding loans held for sale by million from december  to december  despite the continued slow economic environment 
average loan balances increased slightly during to million compared to million in net interest income decreased thousand in from million in the decrease in net interest income is due to the continuation of historically low interest rates throughout and the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  during was as compared to during see below under net interest income and market risk and interest rate sensitivity for a further discussion about the effect of the increase in net interest margin

non interest income was million in as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increased mortgage origination fees as a result of the expansion of this business through the acquisition of palmetto south mortgage corporation psmc in the second half of non interest expense increased to million in as compared to million in as discussed below under non interest income and expense  the increase is attributable to increases in salary and benefits of million in as compared to net interest income increased thousand in from million in to million in the increase in net interest income was primarily due to the increase in the net interest margin in as compared to the impact of the improvement in net interest margin was somewhat offset by a decrease in average earning assets of million from million during to million in the net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  during was  as compared to during net interest spread  the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in  as compared to in the provision for loan losses was million in as compared to million in non interest income was million in as compared to million in this increase is primarily due to lower other than temporary impairment charges  and increases in both mortgage origination fees and fee income on investment advisory services and commission on sale of non deposit products in as compared to non interest expense increased to million in as compared to million in as discussed below under non interest income and expense  the increase is primarily attributable to increases in salary and benefits of thousand in as compared to net interest income net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
net interest income is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the rates earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million in  million in and million in the yield on earning assets was   and in  and  respectively 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was   and in   and  respectively 
the fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was in  in and in our loan to deposit ratio on average during was  as compared to during and during loans typically provide a higher yield than other types of earning assets  and thus  one of our goals is to grow the loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets in order to improve the overall yield on earning assets and the net interest margin 
at december   the loan including held for sale to deposit ratio was 
the net interest margin decreased in as compared to starting in early and continuing through  interest rates have been at historic lows 
the yield on earning assets decreased by basis points and our cost of funds decreased by basis points in as compared to this resulted in a decrease in our net interest spread of basis points in as compared to continued historically low interest rates have impacted our ability to reduce funding cost in relation in proportion to the decline in earning asset yields 
as a result  we continued to control the growth of our balance sheet and increased our funding from lower cost sources non interest bearing transaction accounts  interest bearing transaction accounts  money market accounts and savings 
table of contents deposits 
during  the average balance in these accounts increased by million as compared to this change in the mix of funding sources has lessened the impact of the significant decline in our yield on earning assets 
our average borrowings and time deposits  which are typically the higher costing funding source  decreased million and million  respectively  in as compared to throughout  time deposits and borrowed funds represented of our total interest bearing funding sources and in these balances represented of our interest bearing funding sources 
the net interest margin showed slight improvement in as compared to the yield on earning assets decreased by basis points and our cost of funds decreased by basis points in as compared to this resulted in an increase in our net interest spread of basis points in as compared to close monitoring of time deposit pricing as well as reducing the level of borrowed funds enabled our cost of funds to decline more than the yield on earning assets between the two periods 
our average borrowings and time deposits  which are typically the higher costing funding source  decreased million and million  respectively  in as compared to during  the average balance in the lower cost sources of funding increased by million as compared to this change in the mix of funding sources contributed to the improvement in our margin between the two periods

table of contents average balances  income expenses and rates 
the following table depicts  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average balance sheet and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
average balances have been derived from daily averages

table of contents the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume and the amount attributable to changes in rate

the risk of loss can be measured in either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential net income 
our primary market risk is interest rate risk 
we have established an asset liability management committee alco to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
the alco monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on our net interest income 
the alco has established policy guidelines and strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity 
a monitoring technique employed by us is the measurement of our interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
also  asset liability modeling is performed to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
neither the gap analysis or asset liability modeling are precise indicators of our interest sensitivity position due to the many factors that affect net interest income including  the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity at december

securities based on amortized cost 
we entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement on october  the swap agreement has a million notional amount 
we receive a variable rate of interest on the notional amount based on a three month libor rate and pay a fixed rate interest of 
the contract was entered into to protect us from the negative impact of rising interest rates 
our exposure to credit risk is limited to the ability of the counterparty to make potential future payments required pursuant to the agreement 
our exposure to market risk of loss is limited to the changes in the market value of the swap between reporting periods 
at december  and  the fair value of the contract was a negative thousand and thousand  respectively 
the fair value adjustment during each reporting period is recognized in other income 
for the years ended december   and  the adjustment reflected in earnings amounted to thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
the fair value of the contract is the present value  over the remaining term of the contract  of the difference between the estimated swap rate  for the remaining term  at the reporting date multiplied by the notional amount and the fixed interest rate of multiplied by the notional amount of the contract 
the interest rate swap contract expires on october  through simulation modeling  we monitor the effect that an immediate and sustained change in interest rates of basis points and basis points up and down will have on net interest income over the next months 
based on the many factors and assumptions used in simulating the effect of changes in interest rates  the following table estimates the hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at december  and over the subsequent months 
at december   
table of contents we are slightly asset sensitive 
as a result  our modeling reflects improvement in our net interest income in a rising rate environment 
in a declining rate environment  the model reflects a significant decline in net interest income 
this primarily results from the current level of interest rates being paid on our interest bearing transaction accounts as well as money market accounts 
the interest rates on these accounts are at a level where they cannot be repriced in proportion to the change in interest rates 
the increase and decrease of and basis points assume a simultaneous and parallel change in interest rates along the entire yield curve 
net interest income sensitivity hypothetical percentage change in net interest income december  change in short term interest rates bp bp flat bp bp we also perform a valuation analysis projecting future cash flows from assets and liabilities to determine the present value of equity pve over a range of changes in market interest rates 
the sensitivity of pve to changes in interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of earnings over a longer time horizon 
at december  and  the pve exposure in a plus basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to be and  respectively 
during and  the improvement in the pve to rising rates is a result of two factors 
the first is the change in the mix of our funding sources as noted above in the net interest income section above 
the other significant impact results from changes in certain assumption in our interest rate risk model in during  we performed an internal analysis of our deposit products as it relates to repricing and decay assumptions on certain deposit products 
this study resulted in lengthening the average life and decay rates of our deposit products from what had been modeled in prior periods 
the change in assumptions was not run for prior periods as the change in these assumptions has no impact on the results of operations or financial position 
provision and allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of loans excludes loans held for sale  as compared million  or of loans  at december  our provision for loan loss was thousand for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision is made based on our assessment of general loan loss risk and asset quality 
the allowance for loan losses represents an amount which we believe will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a number of assumptions about future events  which we believe to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove to be accurate 
our determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans  including consideration of factors such as the balance of impaired loans  the quality  mix  and size of our overall loan portfolio  economic conditions that may affect the borrower ability to repay  the amount and quality of collateral securing the loans  our historical loan loss experience  and a review of specific problem loans 
we also consider subjective issues such as changes in the lending policies and procedures  changes in the local national economy  changes in volume or type of credits  changes in volume severity of problem loans  quality of loan review and board of director oversight and concentrations of credit 
periodically  we adjust the 
table of contents amount of the allowance based on changing circumstances 
we charge recognized losses to the allowance and add subsequent recoveries back to the allowance for loan losses 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period  especially considering the overall weakness in the commercial real estate market in our market areas 
we perform an analysis quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio 
the portfolio is segregated into similar risk components for which historical loss ratios are calculated and adjusted for identified changes in current portfolio characteristics 
historical loss ratios are calculated by product type and by regulatory credit risk classification see note loans 
the annualized weighted average loss ratios over the last months for loans classified substandard  special mention and pass have been approximately  and  respectively 
the allowance consists of an allocated and unallocated allowance 
the allocated portion is determined by types and ratings of loans within the portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is established for losses that exist in the remainder of the portfolio and compensates for uncertainty in estimating the loan losses 
as a result of the economic downturn beginning in and continuing through  real estate values have been dramatically impacted 
with our loan portfolio consisting of a large percentage of real estate secured loans we  like most financial institutions  continue to experience higher delinquencies and problem loans from pre historical levels 
non performing assets were million of total assets at december   million of total assets at december   and million of total assets at december  while we continue to experience moderation in this ratio as evidenced by the decline as of december  compared to december   and we believe these ratios are favorable in comparison to current industry results nationally and specifically in our local markets  we continue to be concerned about the impact of this economic environment on our customer base of local businesses and professionals 
as noted below in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses table  the unallocated portion of the allowance as a percentage of the total allowance has grown over the last several years 
the allocated portion of the allowance is based on historical loss experience as well as certain qualitative factors as explained above 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is established for losses that exist in the remainder of the portfolio and compensates for uncertainty in estimating the loan losses 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is composed of factors based on management evaluation of various conditions that are not directly measured in the estimation of probable losses through the experience formula or specific allowances 
the unallocated allowance of the portfolio is primarily identified through discussions with senior credit management and through consideration of various portfolio specifics and other uncertainties outside of our markets that could impact the risk inherent in the portfolio 
these include factors such as uncertainty as to a sustainable economic recovery  ongoing global debt crisis and sustained levels of high national unemployment 
given these uncertainties in economic conditions and particularly real estate valuations  we do not believe it would be prudent to reduce substantially the overall level of our allowance at this time 
the unallocated portion as a percentage of the loan portfolio has grown recently  primarily as a result of higher historical loss periods dropping out of our overall analysis accompanied by a relatively flat loan portfolio 
as economic conditions show sustainable improvement  we believe the unallocated portion of the allowance should decrease as a percentage of the total allowance 
in the near term  however  this percentage may continue to increase slightly 
our company has a significant portion of its loan portfolio with real estate as the underlying collateral 
at december  and  approximately of the loan portfolio had real estate collateral see note to financial statements for concentrations of credit 
when loans  whether commercial or personal  are granted  they are based on the borrower ability to generate repayment cash flows from income sources sufficient to service the debt 
real estate is generally taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment and as a secondary source of repayment 
during this economic cycle many borrowers traditional income sources have been impacted negatively and real 
table of contents estate values have dropped significantly 
we continue to work closely with all our borrowers that are experiencing economic problems as a result of this cycle and believe we have the processes in place to monitor and identify problem credits 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period 
the allowance is also subject to examination and testing for adequacy by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions 
such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
at december    and  we had non accrual loans in the amount of million  million and million  respectively 
nonaccrual loans at december  consisted of loans 
all of these loans are considered to be impaired  are substantially all real estate related  and have been measured for impairment under the fair value of the collateral method 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is believed that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
such fair values are obtained using independent appraisals  which we consider to be level inputs 
the aggregate amount of impaired loans was million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the non accrual loans range in size from thousand to million 
the largest relationship is in the amount of million with a mortgage on an owner occupied commercial business located in the midlands of south carolina 
in addition to the non accrual loans that are considered to be impaired  we have nine loans totaling million that are classified as troubled debt restructurings but are accruing loans as of december  the largest relationship consists of two loans totaling thousand 
the real estate securing these two loans is currently under contract to be sold by the borrower 
see note  loans  to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings 
there were million  million  and million in loans delinquent to days at december   and  respectively 
there were thousand  thousand and thousand in loans greater than days delinquent and still accruing interest at december   and  respectively 
our management continuously monitors non performing  classified and past due loans to identify deterioration regarding the condition of these loans 
we have identified three relationships in the amount of million  which are current as to principal and interest at december  and not included in non performing assets  that could be potential problem loans 
each of these loans is real estate related  and the loans range in size from thousand to thousand 
they have been identified as potential problems based on our review that their traditional sources of cash flow may have been impacted and that they may ultimately not be able to service the debt 
these loans are continually monitored and are considered in our overall evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
the following table summarizes the activity related to our allowance for loan losses

table of contents the following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each of the past five years 
the allocation is calculated on an approximate basis and is not necessarily indicative of future losses or allocations 
the entire amount is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands amount of loans in category amount of loans in category amount of loans in category amount of loans in category amount of loans in category commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial residential consumer unallocated  n a  n a  n a n a n a total accrual of interest is discontinued on loans when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts that a borrower financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
at the time a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest  which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid  is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
a significant source of noninterest income is service charges on deposit accounts 
we also originate fixed rate residential loans on a servicing released basis in the secondary market 
these loans are fixed rate residential loans that are originated in our name 
these loans have locked in price commitments to be purchased by investors at the time of closing 
therefore  these loans present very little market risk for the company 
we typically deliver to  and receive funding from  the investor within days 
other sources of noninterest income are derived from investment advisory fees and commissions on non deposit investment products  bankcard fees  atm debit card fees  commissions on check sales  safe deposit box rent  wire transfer and official check fees 
non interest income increased from million in to million in deposit service charges decreased by thousand in as compared to  primarily as a result of changes to regulation e that became effective july  required that customers affirmatively opt in to our overdraft protection program 
to the extent customers who had previously utilized this product did not opt in  these changes have resulted in reduced fees resulting from atm and point of sale transactions 
it is expected that this regulatory change  along with other proposals or recommendations related to overdraft protection programs including mandated limitations on the number of items an institution can charge within established time frames  as well as  the order in which items presented for payment must be processed on accounts  could reduce deposit service charge fees in the future 
mortgage origination fees increased by million to million in from million in as previously noted  the addition of palmetto south as of july  was a significant contributor to the increased mortgage fees in the third and fourth quarters of and throughout the entire year of historically low interest rates 
table of contents continued to impact the level of refinancing activity during investment advisory fees and non deposit commissions decreased to thousand in as compared to thousand in an increased focus on this source of revenue should enable us to reverse this decline in and thereafter 
during the years ended december  and  we sold certain non agency mbss that were rated below investment grade 
in  we sold eight below investment grade non agency mbss and one investment grade corporate security with a total book value of approximately million 
the loss on the sales amounted to approximately million and was offset by gains of the approximate same amount from the sale of certain agency mbss and municipal securities 
the sales in also related primarily to the sale of certain non agency mbss that had been downgraded to below investment grade 
the sales of below investment grade and the other investment securities resulted in net gains of thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
the proceeds were reinvested in our investment portfolio  primarily in securities with a risk rating of or less 
during the year ended december   we incurred otti charges of thousand credit component on certain non agency mbss that were sold as part of the transactions noted above 
this compares to otti charges in of thousand see note investment securities to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
the sales as well as the otti charges in and continued to significantly reduce the level of securities on our balance sheet that are rated below investment grade 
at december   there were four remaining investments in our portfolio rated below investment grade with a carrying value of million 
during the year ended december  and  we prepaid fhlb advances in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we incurred losses in the amount of thousand and thousand during and  respectively  as a result of the prepayment of these advances 
during  we recorded a negative fair value adjustment on an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million in the amount of thousand as compared to a negative thousand in the interest rate swap was entered into in to protect assets and liabilities from the negative impact in a rising interest rate environment see market risk and interest rate sensitivity discussion 
this swap expires on october  deposit service charges decreased by thousand in as compared to as previously discussed  changes to regulation e that became effective july  required that customers affirmatively opt in to our overdraft protection program 
to the extent customers who had previously utilized this product did not opt in  these changes have resulted in reduced fees resulting from atm and point of sale transactions 
mortgage origination fees increased by thousand to million in from million in the addition of palmetto south as of july  was a significant contributor to the increased mortgage fees in the third and fourth quarters of investment advisory fees and non deposit commissions increased to thousand in as compared to thousand in this increase results from a continued effort and emphasis placed on this revenue source  as well as an overall increase in the assets under management 
for the year ended december   we had net gains on the sale of securities in the amount of thousand  as compared to thousand in the comparable period of the net gains related primarily to the sale of certain non agency mbss that had been downgraded by the rating agencies to below investment grade  other investment grade non agency mbss  agency mbss and shares of fhlmc preferred stock 
the fhlmc preferred stock was previously written down in as a result of fhlmc being placed into conservatorship 
these sales were initiated to reduce the level of securities on our balance sheet that were rated below investment grade 
the cash generated from these transactions was reinvested in our investment portfolio  primarily in securities with a risk rating of or less

table of contents the third and fourth quarters of  we sold two corporate securities  certain non taxable municipal securities and other gse securities and realized gains of thousand 
the sales and resulting net gains during the last half of were a result of our desire to restructure the portfolio to better position us for a rising rate environment as well as investing in securities that have a lower regulatory risk weighting such as gnma mortgage backed securities and sba pools

in  we realized a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of thousand 
other non interest income increased by thousand in as compared to the increase primarily relates to increases in atm surcharge and debit card exchange fees of thousand 
this results from an increase in number of new transaction accounts as well as increased usage of our debit card product by existing customers

in the very competitive financial services industry  we recognize the need to place a great deal of emphasis on expense management and continually evaluate and monitor growth in discretionary expense categories in order to control future increases 
noninterest expense increased from million in to million in salary and benefit expense increased million from million in the to million in at december   we had full time equivalent employees as compared to full time employees at december  as a result of the palmetto south acquisition in the third quarter of  we added approximately full time equivalent employees

these loans are generally held for less than thirty days and have locked in purchase commitments by investors prior to closing

as previously discussed due to the current economic cycle and the significant emphasis by regulators and the investment community on tangible capital  regulatory capital ratios and overall liquidity  we attempted to control the growth of our balance sheet throughout and we have focused on growing our pure deposit base deposits excluding time deposits while continuing to fund soundly underwritten loans 
as a result non interest bearing  now  money market and savings deposits grew by million in while time deposits declined by million 
during and  we sold certain non agency mbss that had previously been downgraded by the rating agencies to below investment grade  other investment grade non agency mbss  agency mbss and shares of fhlmc preferred stock 
the fhlmc preferred stock had previously been written down in as a result of fhlmc being placed into conservatorship 
these sales served to significantly reduce the level of securities on our balance sheet that are rated below investment grade see note  investment securities  for further information 
as of december   the total book value of securities four securities rated below investment grade in our portfolio amounted to million 
as previously noted  management continues to monitor the remaining portfolio with a high degree of scrutiny 
there can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of these securities are other than temporarily impaired  which would require a charge to earnings in such period 
we do not consider any of our investments to have additional other than temporary impairment in excess of amounts previously recognized at december  shareholders equity totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  as previously noted  on july   the company closed a public offering of common stock 
the offering resulted in the issuance of a total of million shares of common stock at per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds were approximately million after deducting underwriting  discount  commissions and other estimated expenses 
the proceeds were used to repurchase the  outstanding shares of our series t preferred stock originally issued to the treasury pursuant to the tarp cpp

in  we funded new loans excluding loans originated for sale of approximately million as compared to million in loan production and portfolio growth rates continue to be impacted by the current slow economic cycle  as borrowers are less inclined to leverage their corporate and personal balance sheets 
however  we remain committed to meeting the credit needs of our local markets 
a continuation of the slow recovery from recessionary national and local economic conditions  as well as deterioration of asset quality within our company  could significantly impact our ability to grow our loan portfolio 
significant increases in regulatory capital expectations beyond the traditional well capitalized ratios and significantly increased regulatory burdens could impede our ability to leverage our balance sheet and expand the loan portfolio

we follow the common practice of financial institutions in the company market area of obtaining a security interest in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan components

also included in our mbs and cmo portfolio are plmbss with an amortized cost of million and approximate fair value of million at december  during the second quarter of  we implemented a leverage strategy whereby we acquired approximately million in certain non agency mbss and cmos 
all of the mortgage assets acquired in this transaction were classified as prime or alt a securities and represented the senior or super senior tranches of the securities

table of contents since the company is a bank holding company  its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal and state regulatory considerations  including the guidelines of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies 
in general  the federal reserve board policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve board policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary 
in addition  under the prompt corrective action regulations  the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized 
these regulatory policies could affect the ability of the company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions 
in addition  since the company is legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and does not conduct stand alone operations  its ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to it  which is also subject to regulatory restrictions 
as a south carolina chartered bank  the bank is subject to limitations on the amount of dividends that it is permitted to pay 
unless otherwise instructed by the sc board  the bank is generally permitted under south carolina state banking regulations to pay cash dividends of up to of net income in any calendar year without obtaining the prior approval of the sc board 
the fdic also has the authority under federal law to enjoin a bank from engaging in what in its opinion constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business  including the payment of a dividend under certain circumstances 
liquidity management liquidity management involves monitoring sources and uses of funds in order to meet our day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
liquidity represents our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable  or which can be pledged  or which will mature in the near future 
liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources  principally the ability to generate customer deposits in our market area 
in addition  liability liquidity is provided through the ability to borrow against approved lines of credit federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and to borrow on a secured basis through securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the bank is a member of the fhlb and has the ability to obtain advances for various periods of time 
these advances are secured by securities pledged by the bank or assignment of loans within the bank portfolio 
with the successful completion of the common stock offering in  the secondary offerings completed in and  the trust preferred offering completed in september  the acquisition of dutchfork in october  the acquisition of dekalb in june  we have maintained a high level of liquidity and adequate capital along with retained earnings  less the and net loss  sufficient to fund the operations of the bank for at least the next months 
we anticipate that the bank will remain a well capitalized institution for at least the next months

total shareholders equity was of total assets at december  and at

the bank maintains federal funds purchased lines  in the amount of million each with two financial institutions  although these were not utilized in the fhlb has approved a line of credit of up to of the bank assets  which would be collateralized by a pledge against specific investment securities and or eligible loans 
we regularly review the liquidity position of the company and have implemented internal policies establishing guidelines for sources of asset based liquidity and limit the total amount of purchased funds used to support the balance sheet and funding from non core sources 
we believe that our existing stable base of core deposits  along with continued growth in this deposit base  will enable us to meet our long term liquidity needs successfully 
we believe our liquidity remains adequate to meet operating and loan funding requirements and that our existing stable base of core deposits  along with continued growth in this deposit base  will enable us to meet our long term and short term liquidity needs successfully 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with gaap  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by the company for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
please refer to note of the company financial statements for a discussion of our off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and the bank are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  we continually seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
