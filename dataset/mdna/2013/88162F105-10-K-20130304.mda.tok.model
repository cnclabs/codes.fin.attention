item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management s focus 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
statements in the following discussion may include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
see item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion of these factors and risks 
business overview during  we continued to pursue our strategy for growth in a market environment characterized by high oil prices  comparatively low domestic natural gas prices  recovering gulf of mexico activity levels  an emergence of attractive international contracts  and continuing overall economic uncertainty 
in response to each of these market factors  we initiated or continued strategic efforts to capitalize on specific growth opportunities 
the most significant of these market developments continues to be the strength of domestic onshore shale reservoir activity 
while the growth levels of certain shale reservoir fields have crested  activity levels in the eagle ford  bakken  niobrara  and permian basin fields have remained robust 
as part of our efforts to strategically expand the markets served by our production testing segment during  we acquired the assets and operations of eastern reservoir services ers  and greywolf production systems  inc and gps ltd 
together greywolf 
these acquisitions contributed significant growth for our production testing segment and allow the segment to capture a greater share of the domestic and canadian markets 
also  in response to continuing strong shale reservoir activity  our fluids division has organically expanded its domestic onshore operations to serve the demand for its frac water management services 
the strength of domestic and canadian crude oil and liquids prices has also led our compressco segment to continue its focus on expanding its capacity to provide unconventional compression applications as a compliment to its significant dry gas production enhancement services 
in the us gulf of mexico  government restrictions and delays in obtaining regulatory permits have eased somewhat and have resulted in a return to pre macondo activity levels 
our fluids division has capitalized on this growth  resulting in significant increases in its deepwater offshore clear brine fluids cbf sales activity 
however  the us gulf of mexico well abandonment and decommissioning market remains challenging for our offshore services segment  and we have implemented cost reduction and asset rationalization efforts to improve the focus and efficiency of this segment 
outside of the united states  we are exploiting unique opportunities for many of our businesses 
our compressco segment continues to grow its latin america operations  while also continuing to pursue other international opportunities 
our production testing segment expanded its scope of services and international presence with the acquisition of optima solutions holding limited optima  an aberdeen  scotland based provider of offshore rig cooling services and associated products that suppress heat generated by high rate flaring of hydrocarbons during well test operations 
our production testing and fluids segments have each also expanded their eastern hemisphere operations through new service contracts and additional activity under existing service contracts  particularly in the middle east 
our consolidated revenues and gross profit for the year ended december   reflect the growth of our production testing  compressco  and fluids segments  each of which achieved record revenue levels during in particular  the results of our production testing segment for include the impact of its acquisitions of optima  ers  and greywolf 
during  these acquisitions contributed aggregate revenues of million and income before taxes  net of million of transaction costs  of million 
our compressco segment also reflected growth in revenues and profitability during compared to  primarily as a result of the increased latin america activity  but also due to the growth of its domestic unconventional application services 
our fluids division also reported increased revenues and profitability compared to  primarily due to the increased cbf product sales from increased activity in the gulf of mexico and from increased services revenues and profits from its growing domestic frac water management operation 
these increases in fluids division cbf and services revenues more than offset the decreased revenues from its manufactured products operation 
partially offsetting the growth in these segments  our offshore services segment reported decreased revenues during compared to due to a number of factors  including weather disruptions  customer project delays  and pricing pressures 
following the sales of its oil and gas producing properties  our maritech segment now generates minimal revenues 
increased consolidated gross profit was partially offset by increased consolidated general and administrative expense  primarily due to the above mentioned acquisitions 
despite spending an aggregate of approximately million on acquisitions and an additional million on capital expenditures during  our balance sheet remains strong 
the majority of the funding for this growth was provided from available cash  and of the million of cash that was borrowed during  million was repaid by year end 
our asset review efforts contributed approximately million in cash from the sale of certain assets  including the sale and leaseback of our corporate headquarters facility 
cash provided from operations during was approximately million  as our focus on cash generation during the fourth quarter  including improved accounts receivable collections  helped offset the significant expenditures to extinguish maritech s remaining decommissioning liabilities during the year 
despite the sale of the maritech properties in and  we continue to utilize a significant portion of our operating cash flows to extinguish maritech s remaining decommissioning liabilities 
we expended approximately million on decommissioning work performed during  and a majority of the remaining decommissioning liability is anticipated to be extinguished during as of december   we had a consolidated cash balance of approximately million  although approximately million of the balance is on compressco partners balance sheet to satisfy its operating requirements as well as to fund quarterly distributions pursuant to its partnership agreement 
subsequent to december   we repaid approximately million of our outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility  and as of march   we had approximately million available under the facility 
as a result of our strong balance sheet  we remain focused on the growth priorities for our core service businesses  including the pursuit of additional acquisitions and funding the ongoing growth capital needs of our segments 
future demand for our products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry  particularly including the level of expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned offshore oil and natural gas properties 
the growth of certain of our businesses may become hampered by the current pricing levels of natural gas  particularly as compared to crude oil 
however  we believe that there are growth opportunities for our products and services in the us and foreign markets  supported primarily by applications for many of our products and services in the continuing exploitation and development of shale reservoirs  increased regulatory requirements governing the abandonment and decommissioning work on aging offshore platforms and wells in the gulf of mexico  increases in technologically driven deepwater oil and gas well completions in the gulf of mexico  and increasing international oil and gas exploration and development activities 
our fluids division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and marketing clear brine completion fluids cbfs  additives  and associated products and services to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling  completion  and workover operations in the united states and in certain countries in latin america  europe  asia  the middle east  and africa 
the fluids division also provides a broad range of associated services  including onsite fluids filtration  handling  and recycling  wellbore cleanup  fluid engineering consultation  and fluid management services  as well as domestic onshore frac water management services 
in addition  the fluids division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry 
fluids division revenues increased million during compared to  primarily due to increased cbf product sales from increased activity in the gulf of mexico  as permitting activity has increased compared to the prior year 
although demand levels for the fluids division s cbf products are driven primarily by completion activity rather than drilling activity  the increase in the gulf of mexico rig count during late to pre macondo levels reflects the increasing demand for offshore cbf products  which steadily increased during demand may continue to be affected by future regulatory restrictions 
we anticipate continued increases in industry spending in  particularly given the current levels of crude oil prices 
also  continuing to capitalize on the industry trend toward developing unconventional onshore shale reservoirs  the fluids division has expanded its onshore frac water management operation  which also contributed to increased revenues and profitability during our production enhancement division consists of two operating segments the production testing segment and the compressco segment 
the production testing segment generates revenues and cash flows by performing after frac flow back  production well testing  offshore rig cooling  and other associated services 
the primary markets served by the production testing segment include many of the major oil and gas producing regions in the united states  mexico  and canada  as well as in certain oil and gas basins in certain regions in south america  africa  europe  the middle east  and australia 
the division s production testing operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting drilling and completion activities in the markets where the production testing segment serves 
the production testing segment s revenues increased significantly by million in compared to  primarily due to the acquisitions of optima  ers  and greywolf during  and due to increased activity in unconventional shale reservoirs 
the production testing segment anticipates that revenues will continue to increase in compared to  primarily as a result of the acquisitions 
compressco generates revenues and cash flows by performing compression based production enhancement services throughout many of the onshore oil and gas producing regions of the united states  as well as certain basins in mexico and canada  and certain countries in south america  eastern europe  and the asia pacific region 
the compressco segment provides services that are used in both conventional wellhead compression applications and unconventional compression applications  and in certain circumstances  well monitoring and sand separation services 
compressco segment revenues increased million in as compared to  primarily due to increased service revenues resulting from increased demand  particularly in latin america  partially offset by a decrease in sales of compressor units 
while there are uncertainties in latin america that could affect operations  including the renewal of certain customer contracts  as well as uncertainties surrounding the domestic price of natural gas which drives demand for a portion of compressco s domestic services  we expect revenues from the segment will continue to increase 
our offshore division consists of two operating segments offshore services and maritech 
offshore services generates revenues and cash flows by performing downhole and subsea oil and gas well plugging and abandonment services  decommissioning and certain construction services utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas production platforms and pipelines  and conventional and saturated air diving services 
the services provided by the offshore services segment are marketed to offshore operators primarily in the us gulf coast region 
gulf of mexico platform decommissioning and well abandonment activity levels are driven primarily by bsee regulations  the age of producing fields  production platforms and other structures  oil and natural gas commodity prices  sales activity of mature oil and gas producing properties  and overall oil and gas company activity levels 
offshore services revenues decreased by million during compared to  due to a number of factors including decreased work performed for maritech  decreased diving  abandonment  and cutting services activity  customer project delays  weather disruptions  pricing pressures  and the sales of certain operations during the past year 
in addition  the profitability of our offshore services segment was affected by approximately million of impairments  primarily related to the decision to sell one of its heavy lift derrick barges due to decreased demand in the shallow waters in which it has historically operated 
however  the offshore services segment anticipates increased profitability going forward compared to as a result of cost reduction and asset rationalization initiatives which began during the latter part of the sales of substantially all of maritech s oil and gas producing properties during and have essentially removed us from the oil and gas exploration and production business 
as part of this strategic decision  beginning in  maritech began selling oil and gas property packages to industry participants and other third parties 
maritech is continuing to seek the sale of its remaining oil and gas producing properties during as a result of these sales of oil and gas properties  maritech s revenues during decreased by million compared to and are expected to continue to be minimal going forward 
maritech s current operations primarily consist of the ongoing plugging  abandonment  and decommissioning associated with its remaining offshore wells  facilities  and production platforms  and we expect to complete the majority of this remaining work during critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared these financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we base these estimates on historical experience  available information  and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectability of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
the fair values of portions of our total assets and liabilities are measured using significant unobservable inputs 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for our judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur  as new information is acquired  and as changes in our operating environment are encountered 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates  and those differences may be material 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
if an impairment of a long lived asset is warranted  we estimate the fair value of the asset based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and our estimates of the amount of future cash flows  the period over which these estimated future cash flows will be generated  as well as the fair value of an impaired asset  are imprecise 
our failure to accurately estimate these future operating cash flows or fair values could result in certain long lived assets being overstated  which could result in impairment charges in periods subsequent to the time in which the impairment indicators were first present 
alternatively  if our estimates of future operating cash flows or fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
although the majority of our impairments of long lived assets have typically related to oil and gas properties  during we recorded other long lived asset impairments of million 
given the current uncertain economic environment  the likelihood of additional material impairments of long lived assets in future periods is higher due to the possibility of decreased demand for our products and services 
impairment of goodwill the impairment of goodwill is also assessed whenever impairment indicators are present  but not less than once annually 
beginning in  the annual assessment for goodwill impairment begins with a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
this qualitative assessment requires the evaluation  based on the weight of evidence  of the significance of all identified events and circumstances for each reporting unit 
based on this qualitative assessment  we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of any of our reporting units were less than their carrying values as of december  if the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  the resulting goodwill impairment test would consist of a two step accounting test performed on a reporting unit basis 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to our estimated implied fair value of that goodwill 
our estimates of reporting unit fair value  if required  are imprecise and are subject to our estimates of the future cash flows of each business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate into each business estimated fair value 
these estimates and judgments are affected by numerous factors  including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment  which affects our overall market capitalization 
if we over estimate the fair value of our reporting units  the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated 
alternatively  if our estimated reporting unit fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
decommissioning liabilities maritech s decommissioning liabilities are established based on what it estimates a third party would charge to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms  and clear the sites 
these well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities referred to as decommissioning liabilities are recorded net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the property 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis  and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech settles these decommissioning liabilities by utilizing the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
this practice saves us the profit margin that a third party would charge for such services 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
any difference between our own internal costs to settle the decommissioning liability and the recorded liability is recognized in the period in which we perform the work 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
once a maritech well abandonment and decommissioning project is performed  any remaining decommissioning liability in excess of the actual cost of the work performed is recorded as a gain and is included in earnings in the period in which the project is completed 
conversely  estimated or actual costs in excess of the decommissioning liability are charged against earnings in the period in which the work is estimated or performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liabilities whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liabilities have changed materially 
the amount of cash flows necessary to abandon and decommission the property is subject to changes due to seasonal demand  increased demand following hurricanes  regulatory changes  and other general changes in the energy industry environment 
accordingly  the estimation of our decommissioning liabilities is imprecise 
maritech has adjusted its decommissioning liabilities during and as a result of increased estimates  as well as a result of the cost of significant abandonment and decommissioning work performed during the year 
maritech recorded approximately and million of excess decommissioning expense during and  respectively  associated with work performed or to be performed on nonproductive oil and gas properties 
in addition  adjustments to decommissioning liabilities associated with productive properties were capitalized to oil and gas properties and contributed significantly to maritech recording approximately million of oil and gas property impairments during the estimation of the decommissioning liabilities associated with the two remaining maritech offshore platforms that were destroyed during the and hurricanes is particularly difficult due to the non routine nature of the efforts required 
the actual cost of performing maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning work has often exceeded our initial estimate of maritech s decommissioning liabilities and has resulted in charges to earnings in the period the work is performed or when the additional liability is determined 
to the extent our decommissioning liabilities are understated  additional charges to earnings may be required in future periods 
revenue recognition we generate revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects under contracts which are typically of short duration and that provide for either lump sum charges or specific time  material  and equipment charges  which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to lump sum contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
the estimation of total costs to be incurred may be imprecise due to unexpected well conditions  delays  weather  and other uncertainties 
inaccurate cost estimates may result in the revenue associated with a specific contract being recognized in an inappropriate period 
total project revenue and cost estimates for lump sum contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
despite the uncertainties associated with estimating the total contract cost  our recognition of revenue associated with these contracts has historically been reasonable 
our production testing segment is party to a south american technical management contract which contains multiple deliverables  including the delivery of equipment and the performance of service milestones 
while the contract provides contract determined values associated with each deliverable  the recognition of revenue is determined based on the realized market values received by the customer as well as by the realizability of collections under the contract 
the determination of realized market values is supported by objective evidence whenever possible  but may also be determined based on our judgments as to the value of a particular deliverable 
income taxes we provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations  and many of these estimates of future operations may be imprecise 
changes in state  federal  and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition  could affect these estimates 
in addition  we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties 
these factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our estimates and judgments associated with our calculations of income taxes have been reasonable in the past  however  the possibility for changes in the tax laws  as well as the current economic uncertainty  could affect the accuracy of our income tax estimates in future periods 
acquisition purchase price allocations we account for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method  which requires the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods  and  in many cases  such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
we have completed several acquisitions during the past several years and have accounted for the various assets including intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of fair values 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired 
our estimates and judgments of the fair value of acquired businesses are imprecise  and the use of inaccurate fair value estimates could result in the improper allocation of the acquisition purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities  which could result in asset impairments  the recording of previously unrecorded liabilities  and other financial statement adjustments 
the difficulty in estimating the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is increased during periods of economic uncertainty 
results of operations the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the associated notes contained elsewhere in this report 
compared to consolidated comparisons year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest expense  net gain loss on sale of assets other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue provision for income taxes income before discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to tetra stockholders consolidated revenues during increased compared to due to the growth and increased activity for many of our businesses  including unprecedented revenue levels for our fluids  production testing  and compressco segments 
in particular  the acquisitions of optima  ers  and greywolf contributed million of increased revenues for our production testing segment during  along with million of increased gross profit 
in addition  our production testing segment also reported increased revenues compared to the prior year due to increased domestic drilling activity  particularly in certain of the shale reservoir markets it serves 
our fluids segment s revenue and gross profit growth was also due to increased industry activity  which resulted in increased cbf product sales  and more than offset the decreased product sales by the segment s manufactured products businesses 
compressco also reported increased revenues and gross profit  primarily due to increased activity and demand in latin america 
these increased revenues more than offset the million decrease in maritech revenues due to the sales of substantially all of its oil and gas producing properties during and early in addition  offshore services revenues from third party customers as a result of the purchase of a heavy lift barge were largely offset by decreased diving and well abandonment services revenue  and the segment s gross profit decreased primarily due to decreased diving and cutting services profitability 
overall gross profit increased  however  primarily due to significant impairments and excess decommissioning costs recorded by maritech during the prior year  the aforementioned acquisitions  and the increased profitability of our fluids  production testing  and compressco segments during the current year 
consolidated general and administrative expenses increased during compared to by million  primarily due to approximately million of increased salaries  benefits  and other employee related costs  partially due to increased headcount as a result of acquisitions as well as due to increased equity compensation 
in addition  general and administrative expenses also increased due to approximately million of increased professional fee expenses  approximately million of increased office expenses  and approximately million of increased insurance and taxes expense 
these increases in consolidated general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million of other general expenses  including decreased provision for doubtful accounts 
the increased professional fee expenses included approximately million of acquisition transaction costs 
consolidated net interest expense increased by million compared to the prior year 
this increase is due to increased borrowings during during  maritech recorded gains on sales of its oil and gas properties  including approximately million from a sale of approximately of its oil and gas producing properties during the second quarter of gains on sales of assets during consist primarily of the million of gains recorded by our offshore services segment for the sale of our electric wireline assets during the fourth quarter of and the sale of certain abandonment assets during the first quarter of consolidated other income increased during compared to the prior year  primarily due to million of hedge ineffectiveness losses recorded during the prior year 
consolidated other income also includes increased earnings from an unconsolidated joint venture compared to the prior year 
our provision for income taxes increased during compared to due to increased net earnings for the current year 
divisional comparisons fluids division year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the increase in fluids division revenues during compared to was primarily due to a million net increase in product sales revenues 
this increase was due to approximately million of increased clear brine fluids cbfs product sales revenues  primarily due to increased domestic offshore well completion activity 
this increase in domestic demand is due to increased activity in the deepwater gulf of mexico  as activity levels in late have returned to the pre macondo levels of early in addition  increased activity in our eastern hemisphere markets have also contributed  particularly in the north sea  west africa  and the middle east regions 
we expect these increased activity levels to continue in the increase in cbf sales was partially offset by approximately million of decreased revenue from manufactured products  primarily from decreased industrial demand due to weather  increased competition  and due to the reduced sales of dry calcium chloride following the shutdown of the pellet plant at our lake charles facility during mid in addition to the net increase in product sales revenues  the division also reported a million increase in services revenues due to increased domestic frac water management service activity in certain of the division s shale reservoir markets compared to the prior year 
however  the growth in domestic onshore service revenues has slowed compared to prior year periods 
fluids division gross profit increased compared to primarily as a result of the increased domestic cbf revenues discussed above and from increased efficiency at our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant 
gross profit from the division s domestic onshore frac water management services operation also increased 
we expect to benefit from ongoing operational improvements at our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride facility in these increases were partially offset by decreased gross profit from the division s european manufactured products operation  which was impacted by the decreased demand discussed above 
in addition  the division s european calcium chloride plant experienced reduced production levels and higher costs during associated with equipment repairs at its calcium chloride plant 
fluids division income before taxes increased compared to the prior year due to the increase in gross profit discussed above and increased other income  despite increased administrative costs 
other income increased primarily due to increased income from an unconsolidated joint venture and foreign currency exchange gains 
fluids division administrative costs increased  primarily due to increased salaries  benefits  and personnel related costs

in addition  the segment reflected revenues from increased domestic drilling in many of its shale reservoir markets compared to the prior year 
these increases  along with increased revenues from the segment s eastern hemisphere operations  were partially offset by decreased revenues in mexico  where demand for certain of the segment s production testing services has decreased and been more than offset  on a consolidated basis  by increased demand for well monitoring services by our compressco segment 
production testing segment gross profit increased in compared to  primarily due to approximately million of increased gross profit from the acquisitions discussed above 
excluding the increased gross profit from these acquisitions  the impact from increased domestic activity was more than offset by increased operating expenses 
in addition  gross profit from the segment s international operations decreased compared to the prior year as a result of the decreased production testing activity in mexico 
production testing income before taxes increased due to the increased gross profit discussed above  as well as due to increased other income  which was primarily due to increased earnings from an unconsolidated joint venture 
the increases in gross profit and other income were partially offset by increased administrative expenses resulting from higher personnel related costs associated with the acquisitions  as well as approximately million of acquisition transaction costs expensed during the period 
compressco segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the increase in compressco revenues compared to the prior year period was primarily due to an increase of million of service revenues resulting from increased activity  particularly in latin america 
while there are uncertainties in latin america that could affect operations  including the renewal of certain customer contracts  we expect revenues from our latin american operations will continue to increase 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decrease from sales of compressor units and parts during compared to the prior year 
compressco continues to expand its fleet in latin america to serve the increasing demand 
compressco gross profit increased during compared to  primarily due to the increased latin america activity discussed above  an increase in overall average compressor unit utilization from to  and also due to continuing reductions in domestic operating expenses 
income before taxes for compressco increased during compared to due to the increased gross profit discussed above and despite increased administrative expenses 
compressco s administrative expenses reflect increased administrative staff and professional fee expenses associated with being a separate publicly traded limited partnership 
administrative expenses during the current year period also reflect increased equity compensation expense arising from current year equity grants by compressco partners and the impact of a severance agreement 
additionally  incentive compensation expense increased as a result of favorable overall financial results 
beginning in june  general and administrative expense also includes the allocation of a portion of our corporate administrative expenses to compressco partners pursuant to our omnibus agreement with compressco partners

increased decommissioning services revenues  including those from the tetra hedron heavy lift barge purchased during  were offset by decreased diving  abandonment  and cutting services revenues during in addition to the continuing challenges of pricing pressures  reduced activity levels  reduced number of leased vessels  and project delays experienced by several of the offshore services segment s customers  the segment also experienced weather disruptions during the current year  particularly from tropical storm debby and hurricane isaac 
diving services revenues were also negatively affected by scheduled vessel repairs during the first quarter of in addition  revenues decreased due to the and early sales of certain of the segment s onshore abandonment assets and operations  which generated approximately million in revenues during the prior year period 
in december  the segment also disposed of its wireline assets  which generated million and million of revenues during and  respectively 
approximately million of offshore services revenues were from work performed for maritech during  compared to million of such work in the prior year 
maritech plans to continue to aggressively decommission and abandon its remaining oil and gas platform structures  and we expect that the majority of this remaining maritech work will be completed during intercompany revenues from maritech work are eliminated in consolidation 
gross profit for the offshore services segment during slightly decreased compared to  despite approximately million of due diligence and start up costs during associated with the purchase of the tetra hedron 
gross profit decreased primarily due to decreased profitability of our diving and cutting services operations  which largely resulted from decreased utilization and pricing during in the fourth quarter of  we reclassified the tetra db derrick barge as an asset held for sale and recorded a million impairment on the asset 
the segment also identified other asset impairments of approximately million 
the decreased profitability of our diving and cutting operations was partially offset by improved profitability of our heavy lift and abandonment operations 
in addition to the impact of ongoing cost reductions that began during  the offshore services segment expects increased profitability during as a result of increased bid activity and an observed decrease in gulf of mexico federal permitting delays 
offshore services segment income before taxes increased during  despite the reduced gross profit discussed above and increased general and administrative expenses 
these decreases were more than offset by the gains on the sale of certain abandonment and wireline assets that generated approximately million of other income during offshore services segment administrative expenses increased during  primarily due to increased salary and employee related expenses and increased bad debt and professional fee expenses during the year

following the sales of almost all of its producing properties  maritech revenues are expected to continue to be negligible 
maritech gross loss decreased during compared to the prior year  primarily due to reduced operating and depletion expenses associated with the sold properties 
in addition  maritech recorded million of impairments and approximately million of higher excess decommissioning costs associated with maritech s remaining decommissioning liabilities during the prior year period 
we expect the substantial majority of maritech s decommissioning liabilities to be extinguished in subsequent to december   in february  maritech entered into a settlement agreement with one of its underwriters relating to litigation involving its insurance claim following hurricane ike 
pursuant to the settlement  maritech received approximately million  and the impact of this settlement is expected to be reflected in first quarter results of operations 
maritech reported an increased pretax loss during compared to  primarily due to approximately million million consolidated of gains from sales of producing properties reported during this decrease compared to was partially offset by the decreased gross loss discussed above 
in addition  maritech reported decreased net administrative expenses during  primarily due to the reduction in its headcount following the sale of properties 
this decrease in administrative costs was partially offset by increased legal expenses and decreased administrative costs billed to joint owners

such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
however  in connection with the public offering of common units in our compressco partners subsidiary  on june   we began allocating and charging compressco partners for its share of our corporate administrative costs directly related to compressco partners activities 
corporate overhead decreased during compared to the prior year  primarily due to a million hedge ineffectiveness loss during this hedge ineffectiveness loss was mainly due to the april liquidation of hedge derivative contracts  following the planned sale of a significant portion of maritech oil and gas producing properties  which resulted in a million charge to corporate other expense for hedge ineffectiveness during the second quarter of corporate general and administrative expenses increased  largely due to approximately million of increased employee related expenses  primarily due to million of increased salaries and equity compensation  which includes the impact of severance costs associated with our previous chief financial officer 
in addition  professional fee expenses increased approximately million and office and insurance expenses increased by approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of decreased tax expenses 
corporate interest expense also increased  due to increased borrowings outstanding during much of in december  we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters building for approximately million  before transaction costs and other deductions  and entered into a lease of the facility with a minimum lease term of years 
as a result  beginning in  corporate overhead will reflect the decreased depreciation expense associated with the sale  and general and administrative expense will reflect an increase for the lease expense going forward

in particular  revenues from our production testing segment increased significantly due to increased domestic demand and higher activity in mexico 
in addition  fluids segment revenues increased due to cbf sales activity in the regions we serve as well as increased calcium chloride sales activity  primarily domestically 
our compressco segment reported increased revenues  due largely to increased sales of compressor units during the year  but also due to increased international and domestic demand for its compression based services 
our offshore services segment also reported increased revenues due to increased well abandonment and decommissioning service activity during compared to overall gross profit increased primarily due to higher profitability from our production testing and fluids segments  both of which reflect the increased demand for their domestic onshore products and services 
our offshore services segment also reflected increased gross profit  primarily due to the impairment of one of its dive service vessels during consolidated general and administrative expenses increased during compared to due to approximately million of increased salaries  benefits  and other employee related costs  partially due to increased headcount 
this increase was despite a million decrease in equity based compensation 
in addition  general and administrative expenses also increased due to approximately million of increased professional fee expenses  million of decreased billings to joint owners for maritech administrative overhead  and million of increased bad debt expense  primarily due to the reversal of million of bad debt expense during in addition  insurance  taxes  and other general expenses increased by approximately million 
net consolidated interest expense decreased during primarily due to increased interest income resulting from increased cash investments 
consolidated gains on sales of assets increased significantly during  primarily due to the sale of maritech oil and gas producing properties  particularly the may sale of properties to tana 
consolidated other expense was million during and was primarily due to the million charge to expense upon the liquidation of commodity derivative swap contracts in connection with the decision to sell maritech oil and gas producing properties 
in addition  other expense includes approximately million of increased foreign currency losses 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of decreased other expense compared to primarily due to a million premium that was charged during in connection with the early repayment of the senior notes

this increase was due to million of increased cbf product sales revenues  as increased activity internationally  particularly in brazil  more than offset a decrease in domestic offshore activity and pricing 
domestic offshore activity levels continue to be reduced as a result of the uncertain regulations governing offshore drilling activities following the april macondo accident 
also contributing to the increased revenues was million of increased sales of calcium chloride and other manufactured products  primarily from our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant 
increased onshore domestic activity levels  particularly associated with unconventional shale reservoir markets  resulted in approximately million of increased service revenues  including increased revenues from frac water management services 
our fluids division gross profit increased during compared to  primarily as a result of the increased gross profit from our chemicals manufacturing operations resulting from the impairment of the million carrying value of the division s lake charles  louisiana  calcium chloride plant 
due to the market pricing for calcium chloride and the uncertain supply of raw materials needed to operate the plant on economic terms  the expected operating cash flows of the plant were insufficient to cover the plant s carrying value 
in addition  startup costs and production inefficiencies during negatively affected the profitability of our el dorado  arkansas  plant 
while many of these production inefficiencies were mitigated during  we continue to seek ways to improve the plant s operating performance 
associated with these plant operational inefficiencies  in march  we filed a lawsuit in union county  arkansas  seeking to recover damages related to certain design and other services provided in connection with the construction of the el dorado plant 
in addition to the improved gross profit from our chemicals manufacturing operations  gross profit generated from the increased frac water management and other services during more than offset the decreased gross profit from sales of cbfs  that was primarily a result of the decreased domestic offshore market 
fluids division income before taxes increased during compared to due to the increase in gross profit discussed above and an increase in other income  which more than offset the increased administrative costs

this increase was a result of increased domestic onshore oil and gas drilling activity  as reflected by rig count data 
in particular  the production testing segment is capitalizing on the increased domestic onshore activity associated with unconventional shale drilling in many of the regions it serves 
in addition  international revenues increased by approximately million  primarily due to increased pemex activity in mexico 
the increase in production testing gross profit during was primarily due to the increased domestic activity discussed above and the increased efficiencies at the higher activity levels 
gross profit on international production testing operations also increased during primarily due to increased profitability on a south american technical management contract 
production testing income before taxes increased due to the increased gross profit discussed above 
these increases were partially offset by increased administrative expenses  primarily from increased salary and other employee related costs during the period 
in addition  the production testing segment reflected increased office and professional fees  as well as increased bad debt expense  particularly associated with the segment s libyan operations

to a lesser extent  service revenue also increased due to increased domestic demand 
compressco gross profit increased during compared to  primarily due to the increased sales of compressor units 
in addition  gross profit on international service revenues increased  particularly in latin america 
gross profit on domestic service revenues decreased  despite the increase in revenues  due to increased operating expenses 
income before taxes for compressco decreased during compared to  despite the increase in gross profit described above  primarily due to increased administrative expense 
compressco administrative expenses reflect the increased professional fee expenses and increased administrative staff as a result of compressco partners being a separate public limited partnership and the allocation of a portion of our corporate administrative expenses to compressco partners pursuant to the omnibus agreement which we and compressco partners executed in connection with compressco partners initial public offering 
in addition  the compressco segment had increased other expense  primarily due to increased foreign currency losses

these increases were partially offset by decreased cutting services and wireline activity  and the impact throughout of a softer pricing environment 
in addition  during may  we sold our onshore abandonment operations  although this sale is not expected to significantly reduce our revenues in the future 
in july  we purchased a new heavy lift derrick barge which we named the tetra hedron with a  metric ton lift capacity  fully revolving crane 
with this vessel  which was placed into service in the gulf of mexico during the fourth quarter of  our offshore services segment has significantly increased its heavy lift capacity  enabling us to better serve the gulf of mexico decommissioning market and to serve customers with heavier structures 
approximately million of offshore services revenues were from work performed for maritech during  compared to million of such work during these intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation 
gross profit for the offshore services segment during increased as compared to due to approximately million of impairments during  primarily from the impairment of the carrying value of the epic diver  a dive support vessel owned by our epic diving marine services subsidiary 
during  we determined that this vessel was no longer strategic to the segment s plan to serve its markets 
while the purchase of the tetra hedron heavy lift derrick barge is expected to generate increased profitability for our decommissioning operations going forward  gross profit for was decreased by approximately million for the due diligence  inspection  and start up costs incurred during prior to the vessel being placed into service during the fourth quarter 
overall segment profitability was also affected by a lower pricing environment during  partly due to increased competition 
offshore services segment income before taxes increased primarily due to the increase in gross profit described above 
in addition  offshore services segment administrative costs decreased primarily due to decreased salaries and employee related  office expenses  insurance  and other general costs 
offshore services segment income before taxes also increased due to the increase in other income  which was primarily generated from the sale of onshore abandonment operations during maritech segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit loss gross profit loss as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net gain loss on sales of assets other income expense  net income loss before taxes and discontinued operations income loss before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue maritech revenues decreased significantly during compared to  due to the sale during of approximately of maritech s total proved oil and gas reserves as of december  the most significant sale of oil and gas producing properties was on may   when maritech completed the sale to tana of oil and gas properties that collectively represented approximately of maritech s december   total proved reserves 
as a result of these sales  decreased production volumes resulted in decreased revenues of approximately million 
in addition to the impact of decreased production  maritech revenues decreased approximately million  primarily due to decreased realized prices of maritech s natural gas production 
maritech had previously hedged a portion of its expected production cash flows by entering into derivative hedge contracts and its contracts hedging its oil production extended through however  maritech s natural gas hedges expired at the end of maritech s average natural gas price received during was mmbtu compared to the mcf average realized price received during in april  in connection with the planned sale of oil and gas producing properties to tana  we liquidated the oil derivative hedge contracts 
as a result  beginning april  maritech s remaining oil and gas production cash flows are no longer hedged 
including the impact of its oil hedge contracts through march  maritech reflected average realized oil prices during of barrel compared to barrel during following the above mentioned sales of producing properties  maritech revenues are expected to continue to be minimal going forward 
maritech gross profit decreased during compared to due to the decreased revenues discussed above  although this was largely offset by decreased operating and depletion expenses also as a result of the sales of properties 
although oil and gas property impairments also decreased approximately million during compared to  this decrease was partially offset by approximately million of increased excess decommissioning costs 
a large portion of the excess decommissioning costs recorded during was associated with properties not operated by maritech 
in addition  maritech recorded approximately million of insurance settlement gains during as a result of settlement and claim proceeds from hurricane ike damages 
maritech continues to perform significant decommissioning work on its remaining offshore facilities and platforms  and additional charges for decommissioning costs in excess of estimates may occur in future periods 
despite the decrease in gross profit discussed above  maritech reported a decreased loss before taxes during compared to due to approximately million million consolidated of net gains on the sales of producing properties during partially offsetting this increase in gain on sale was the increase in administrative expenses  primarily due to decreased overhead allocated and billed to joint owners on operated properties  caused by the sales of the properties 
in addition  decreased salary  benefit  and employee related expenses resulting from the decrease in administrative staff during the last half of was largely offset by retention and incentive compensation incurred earlier in the year associated with the sale of maritech properties 
in addition  maritech administrative expense includes an increase in bad debt expenses  primarily due to a reversal of bad debt expense during corporate overhead year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages gross profit loss primarily depreciation expense general and administrative expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net loss before taxes and discontinued operations corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expense  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are generally not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
however  in connection with the public offering of common units in our compressco partners subsidiary  on june   we began allocating and charging compressco partners for its share of our corporate administrative costs directly related to compressco partners activities 
corporate overhead increased significantly during compared to  primarily due to increased other expense which resulted from approximately million of increased hedge ineffectiveness loss 
this increased hedge ineffectiveness loss was due to the april liquidation of hedge derivative contracts  following the planned sale of a significant portion of maritech oil and gas producing properties  which resulted in a million charge to corporate other expense for hedge ineffectiveness 
in addition  other expense increased due to approximately million of decreased foreign currency gains and despite a million premium that was charged during in connection with the early repayment of the senior notes 
corporate administrative costs increased due to approximately million of increased salaries and other general employee expenses  despite approximately million decrease in equity based compensation 
in addition  corporate administrative costs also increased due to approximately million of increased insurance and tax expenses 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of decreased professional fee expenses 
liquidity and capital resources our growth strategy continues to include the pursuit of suitable acquisitions and other opportunities to expand our operations 
during the year ended december   we spent approximately million of cash on acquisitions 
in march  we spent approximately million from our available cash to acquire the common stock of optima  a provider of offshore rig cooling services and associated products that suppress heat generated by high rate flaring of hydrocarbons during well test operations 
in april  we spent an additional million of our available cash to acquire the assets and operations of ers  a domestic production testing and after frac flow back operation 
in july  we spent an additional million from available cash and borrowings to acquire the assets and operations of greywolf  a north american production testing and after frac flow back operation 
each of these acquisitions has significantly and strategically expanded our production testing segment s operations 
to fund the acquisition of greywolf and to provide for general corporate working capital needs and other purposes in the last half of  we borrowed million and million euros approximately million equivalent at december  pursuant to our revolving credit facility 
in addition to funding these acquisitions  during the year ended december   we spent million on additional capital expenditures for our existing businesses 
in addition to funding the acquisition and capital expenditure activity from available cash and borrowings  we also generated approximately million from the sale of certain assets  including the sale and leaseback of our corporate headquarters facility 
cash provided by operations also increased during the fourth quarter of  largely as a result of cash collection efforts 
our future operating cash flows  as well as revenues and profitability levels  are largely dependent on the level of oil and gas industry activity in the markets we serve and are significantly affected by oil and natural gas commodity prices 
operating cash flows are expected to increase significantly as a result of the acquisitions and after the extinguishment of maritech s remaining decommissioning liabilities 
these efforts resulted in the use of million of our operating cash flows during  and the majority of the remaining decommissioning work is expected to be completed in as of december   we had a consolidated cash balance of approximately million  although approximately million of this balance is on compressco partners balance sheet to satisfy its operating requirements and fund quarterly distributions pursuant to its partnership agreement 
although the use of approximately million of cash on the above acquisitions significantly changes our liquidity position compared to december   we continue to have significant capital resources  including million in availability under our revolving credit facility as of march  operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities totalled million during compared to million of cash generated by operating activities in  a decrease of million 
this decrease in operating cash flows during compared to the prior year primarily reflects the increased use of operating cash flows for working capital during the current year and the sale by maritech of substantially all of its oil and gas properties during increased cash used for working capital during compared to was mainly as a result of increased accounts receivable balances and the collection of federal tax refunds during the period 
cash flows from operating activities have increased following the acquisitions of optima  ers  and greywolf  and the impact of these acquisitions is expected to continue to generate increased cash flows going forward in compared to during the past three years  maritech has performed an extensive amount of well abandonment and decommissioning work associated with its offshore oil and gas production wells  platforms  and facilities 
as of december   and following the sales of substantially all of its oil and gas producing properties  the estimated third party discounted value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liabilities totalled million 
our future operating cash flow will continue to be affected by the actual timing and amount of maritech s decommissioning expenditures 
approximately million of the cash outflow necessary to extinguish maritech s remaining decommissioning liability is expected to occur over the twelve month period ending december  included in maritech s decommissioning liabilities is the remaining abandonment  decommissioning  and debris removal associated with two offshore platforms that were previously destroyed by hurricanes 
due to the unique nature of the remaining work to be performed associated with these downed platforms  actual costs could greatly exceed these estimates and  depending on the nature of any excess costs incurred  could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods 
in some cases  the previous owners of properties that were acquired by maritech are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties after the work is performed 
approximately million of such contractual reimbursement arrangements as of december   is classified as receivable assets related to amounts waiting to be invoiced and or collected 
demand for a large portion of our products and services is driven by oil and gas industry activity  which is affected by oil and natural gas commodity pricing 
given that north american natural gas prices have been volatile and decreased relative to crude oil prices during the past year  drilling activity related to natural gas wells in north america has decreased 
while only a portion of our revenues are related to gas drilling activity  we are exposed to the impact that this decreased demand could have on our businesses 
in particular  our production testing  compressco  and fluids segments are vulnerable to the impact of a sustained low natural gas price environment 
in addition  decreases in future worldwide crude oil prices could also affect future overall industry drilling activity in certain of the regions in which we operate 
if oil or gas industry activity levels decrease in the future  our levels of operating cash flows may be negatively affected 
we are subject to operating hazards normally associated with onshore and offshore oilfield service operations  including fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering  mechanical problems  abnormally pressured formations  and accidents that cause harm to the environment 
we maintain various types of insurance that are designed to be applicable in the event of an explosion or other catastrophic event involving our offshore operations 
this insurance includes third party liability  workers compensation and employers liability  general liability  vessel pollution liability  and operational risk coverage for our maritech oil and gas properties  including removal of debris  operator s extra expense  control of well  and pollution and clean up coverage 
our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles that must be satisfied prior to recovery 
additionally  our insurance is subject to certain exclusions and limitations 
we believe our policy of insuring against such risks  as well as the levels of insurance we maintain  is typical in the industry 
in addition  we provide services and products in the offshore gulf of mexico generally pursuant to agreements that create insurance and indemnity obligations for both parties 
our maritech subsidiary maintains a formalized oil spill response plan that is submitted to the bsee 
maritech has designated third party contractors in place to ensure that resources are available as required in the event of an environmental accident 
while it is impossible to anticipate every potential accident or incident involving our offshore operations  we believe we have taken appropriate steps to mitigate the potential impact of such an event on the environment in the regions in which we operate 
investing activities during  the total amount of our net cash used in investing activities was million and included million for the acquisitions of optima  ers and greywolf in march  april and july  respectively 
in addition to cash spent on acquisitions  total cash capital expenditures during were million 
approximately million of our capital expenditures during was spent by our fluids division  the majority of which related to the purchase of new equipment to support its onshore frac water management services business 
our production enhancement division spent approximately million of capital expenditures  consisting of approximately million by the production testing segment to add or replace a portion of its production testing equipment fleet  and approximately million by the compressco segment  primarily for the upgrade and expansion of its wellhead compressor and equipment fleet 
our offshore services segment spent approximately million for costs on its various heavy lift and dive support vessels 
corporate capital expenditures were approximately million 
generally  a significant majority of our planned capital expenditures is related to identified opportunities to grow and expand our existing businesses other than maritech 
we plan to spend over million on total capital expenditures during however  certain of these planned expenditures may be postponed or cancelled in an effort to conserve capital 
the deferral of capital projects could affect our ability to compete in the future 
as reflected by our recent acquisitions of optima  ers  and greywolf  our long term growth strategy also continues to include the pursuit of suitable acquisitions or opportunities to expand operations in oil and gas service markets 
to the extent we consummate an additional significant acquisition transaction or other capital project  our liquidity position and capital plans will be affected 
sales of assets during generated approximately million of proceeds  including approximately million of net proceeds generated from the sale and leaseback of our corporate headquarters facility in the woodlands  texas 
in addition  identified offshore services segment assets were sold for additional consideration of approximately million 
financing activities to fund our capital and working capital requirements  we may supplement our existing cash balances and cash flow from operating activities as needed from long term borrowings  short term borrowings  equity issuances  and other sources of capital
