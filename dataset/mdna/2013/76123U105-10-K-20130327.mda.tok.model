item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
special note regarding forward looking statements the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  this discussion contains forward looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
overview response genetics  inc the company was incorporated in the state of delaware on september  as bio type  inc for the purpose of providing unique molecular profiling services of tumor tissue that has been formalin fixed and embedded in paraffin 
in august  we changed our name to response genetics  inc clinical studies have shown that not all cancer chemotherapy works effectively in every patient  and that a number of patients receive therapy that has no benefit to them and may potentially even be harmful 
our goal is to provide cancer patients and their physicians with a means to make informed  individualized treatment decisions based on genetic analysis of tumor tissues 
we are focusing our efforts in the following areas continued commercialization of our responsedx tests  developing additional diagnostic tests for assessing the risk of cancer recurrence  prediction to therapy response and tumor classification in cancer patients  and expanding our testing services business by pursuing new technologies through collaborations and in licensing to expand our business 
our technologies enable us to reliably and consistently extract the nucleic acids rna and dna from tumor specimens that are stored as formalin fixed and paraffin embedded  specimens and thereby to analyze genetic information contained in these tissues 
this is significant because the majority of patients diagnosed with cancer have a tumor biopsy sample stored in paraffin  while only a small percentage of patients tumor specimens are frozen 
our technologies also enable us to use the formalin fixed paraffin embedded ffpe patient biopsies for the development of diagnostic tests 
responsedx the outcome of cancer therapy is highly variable due to genetic differences among patients 
some patients respond well with tumor shrinkage and increase in life span 
other patients do not obtain benefit from the same therapy and may actually experience toxic side effects  psychological trauma and delay in effective treatment 
at present  most cancer treatment regimens are administered without any pre selection of patients on the basis of their particular genetics 
however  recent development of very sensitive molecular technologies has enabled researchers to identify and measure genetic and biochemical factors in patients tissues that may predict the probability of success or failure of many currently used anti cancer agents 
in order to increase the chances of a better outcome for cancer patients  we have and continue to expand our development of genetic tests for measuring predictive factors for tumor response in tumor tissue samples 
we offer tests for non small cell lung cancer nsclc  colorectal cancer crc and gastric and gastroesophageal cancer ge  and melanoma cancer patients tumor tissue specimens through our responsedx lung  responsedx colon  responsedx gastric and responsedx melanoma test suites at our laboratory located in los angeles  california  which is certified under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of clia 
these tests serve to help oncologists make optional therapeutic decisions for cancer patients 
the results from our tests may help oncologists choose among therapies to treat their cancer patients 
as of december   our sales team consisted of members located in the west coast  midwest  and east coast areas of the united states 
diagnostic tests for other cancers in addition to responsedx lung  responsedx colon  responsedx gastric and responsedx melanoma  we intend to develop and commercialize tests for other types of cancer 
we also are identifying genetic profiles of tumors that are more or less responsive to a particular therapy 
following the development of tests to determine the most active therapy regimen for the individual patient at risk  we intend to leverage our relationships in the healthcare industry to market  sell or license these tests as a means for physicians to determine the courses of cancer treatment 
pursue additional collaborations and in licensing to expand our business we intend to pursue additional collaborations with pharmaceutical companies or in licensing of products or technologies that will enable us to accelerate the implementation of our plans to expand the services we provide to oncologists and pathologists 
we expect to implement this plan by way of licensing of technology and know how  investments in other companies  strategic collaborations  and other similar transactions 
we expect these collaborations to provide us with early access to new technologies available for commercialization 
there are no assurances that we will be able to continue making our current responsedx tests available  or make additional responsedx tests available  or that we will be able to develop and commercialize tests of other types of cancer  or that we will be able to expand our testing service business through collaborations 
we anticipate that  over the next months  a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts will be focused on sales and marketing activities related to our responsedx diagnostic tests  research and development to expand our series of diagnostic tests for cancer patients  and for other general corporate purposes 
research and development expenses represented and of our total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
major components of the  and  in research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  included supplies and reagents for our research activities  personnel costs  occupancy costs  equipment warranties and service  patent fees  insurance  business consulting and sample procurement costs 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition pharmaceutical revenue revenues that are derived from pharmacogenomic testing services provided to pharmaceutical companies are recognized on a contract specific basis pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
revenue is recognized in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the client or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded on an accrual basis as the contractual obligations are completed and as a set of assays is processed through the company s laboratory under a specified contractual protocol and are recorded on the date the tests are resulted 
certain contracts have minimum assay requirements that  if not met  result in payments that are due upon the completion of the designated period 
in these cases  revenues are recognized when the end of the specified contract period is reached  if the minimum assay requirements are not met 
responsedx revenue net revenue for the company s diagnostic services is recognized on an accrual basis at the time discreet diagnostic tests are completed 
each test performed relates to a specimen encounter derived from a patient  and received by the company on a specific date such encounter is commonly referred to as an accession 
the company s services are billed to various payors  including medicare  private health insurance companies  healthcare institutions  and patients 
the company reports net revenue from contracted payors  including certain private health insurance companies  and healthcare institutions based on the contracted rate  or in certain instances  the company s estimate of the amount expected to be collected for the services provided 
for billing to medicare  the company uses the published fee schedules  net of standard discounts commonly referred to as contractual allowances 
the company reports net revenue from non contracted payors  including certain private health insurance companies  based on the amount expected to be collected for the services provided 
the company analyzes historical payments from payors as a percentage of amounts billed by the company to estimate expected collections for purposes of recording net revenue 
the company has its medicare provider number which allows it to invoice and collect from medicare 
invoicing to medicare is primarily based on amounts allowed by medicare for the service provided as defined by common procedural terminology cpt codes 
in january  the initial annual medicare fee schedules update was announced which includes proposed changes to medicare reimbursement rates that significantly reduce the reimbursement rates for certain of the testing services we provide 
the company is participating directly and with other impacted organizations to provide guidance to the local medicare administrative contractor that may result in an adjustment to the proposed reimbursement rates that it believes better reflects the value of the services being performed 
if  however  the initial reduction in reimbursement rates is adopted as is  it may have a material adverse effect on the company operations 
license fees we have licensed technology for the extraction of rna and dna from ffpe tumor specimens from usc in exchange for royalty fees on revenue generated by use of this technology 
these royalties are calculated as a fixed percentage of revenue that we generate from use of the technology licensed from usc 
total license fees expensed in cost of revenue under the license agreement with usc were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also maintain a non exclusive license to use roche s pcr  homogenous pcr  and reverse transcription pcr processes 
we pay roche a fixed percentage royalty fee for revenue that we generate through use of this technology 
royalties expensed in cost of revenue under the roche agreement totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are subject to potentially significant variations in royalties recorded in any period 
while the amount paid is based on a fixed percentage from revenues of specific tests pursuant to terms set forth in the agreements with usc and roche  the amount due is calculated based on the revenue we recognize using the respective licensed technology 
as discussed above  this revenue can vary from period to period as it is dependent on the timing of the specimens submitted by our clients for testing 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we invoice our pharmaceutical clients as specimens are processed and any other contractual obligations are met 
our contracts with pharmaceutical clients typically require payment within days of the date of invoice 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  client credit  current economic trends and changes in client payment trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
to date  our clients have primarily been large pharmaceutical companies 
bad debts to date have been minimal and there is no allowance for doubtful accounts for our pharmaceutical revenue at december  and we bill medicare and private payors private payors for responsedx upon completion of the required testing services 
as such  we take assignment of benefits and the risk of collection with medicare and private payors 
we continue to monitor the collection history for medicare and private payors 
based on the historical experience for our medicare and private payor accounts  we have determined  based on a detailed analysis  that accounts receivable associated with certain billings are unlikely to be collected 
therefore  we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of december  and  respectively 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for estimated uncollectible amounts due from the company s various payor groups 
the process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts involves significant assumptions and judgments 
specifically  the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted periodically  and is principally based upon an evaluation of historical collection experience of accounts receivable for the company s various payor classes 
after appropriate collection efforts  accounts receivable are written off and deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to bad debt expense 
the payment realization cycle for certain governmental and managed care payors can be lengthy  involving denial  appeal  and adjudication processes  and is subject to periodic adjustments that may be significant 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
we consider all available information in our assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
income taxes we estimate our tax liability through calculations we perform for the determination of our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our balance sheets 
our management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods through future operating results 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to adjust the net carrying value of such assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income  based on management s estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions take into consideration future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in determining recoverability of such assets 
our valuation allowance is subject to significant change based on management s estimates of future profitability and the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets 
the company has established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
results of operations years ended december  and december  revenue 
revenues were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in pharmaceutical revenues of  responsedx revenues decreased  responsedx revenue accounted for of total revenue in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  responsedx revenues for the year ended december   decreased as compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the initial phases of restructuring efforts within the sales team during and the company s focus on its relationship with its largest pharmaceutical client 
for the year ended december   our two most significant pharmaceutical clients accounted for approximately of our revenue  as compared to approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  cost of revenue 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease in revenue resulted in lower direct costs to generate the corresponding revenue 
the decrease as a percentage was not equivalent to the corresponding decrease in revenue as a large portion of our costs are labor related therefore limiting our ability to make adjustments based on fluctuations in volume 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was for the three months ended december  indicating a focus on improving our laboratory operations in order to drive continued improvements in our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increased efforts related to the development of new molecular tests which were released in the second half of the increases primarily result from an increase in laboratory supplies  reagents and microarray costs  personnel related cost and legal services related to our intellectual property 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as we work to develop additional aspects of our technology  launch next generation sequencing and study diagnostic indicators for various forms of cancer 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
generally  the company has been focused on reducing costs in key areas during the second half of this decrease resulted primarily from decreases in personnel costs of  travel of  professional consulting fees of  legal fees of  business taxes of  and a asset impairment charge of  offset by an increase in facility related costs of  and stock compensation expense of  sales and marketing expenses 
for the year ended december   our sales and marketing expenses totaled  compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the decrease primarily resulted from the initial phases of restructuring sales and marketing activities for responsedx  which included decreases in marketing related activities of  and personnel costs of  offset by increases in travel costs of  and marketing consulting of  we expect that sales and marketing costs will increase as we expand our sales and marketing team and related activities 
other income and expense 
other income and expense primarily represents the interest expense we incur on our revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  compared with  for the same period in the company s initial drawdown of  on the line of credit was completed in october and therefore the company only incurred interest expense for the fourth quarter of net income loss 
as a result of the foregoing  our net loss increased by approximately  to approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we incurred net losses of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
since our inception in september  we have incurred cumulative losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we have not yet achieved profitability and anticipate that we will likely incur additional losses for the next year 
we cannot provide assurance as to when we will achieve profitability 
we expect that our cash and cash equivalents will be used to fund our selling and marketing activities primarily related to our responsedx tests  research and development  and general corporate purposes 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
management intends to effectively manage cash flows in and expects that cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital requirements through the next months 
nevertheless  until we can generate and maintain sufficient revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance additional cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  strategic collaborations  our line of credit and other financing opportunities 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate selling and marketing activities or research and development programs 
the company is a party to a line of credit agreement with silicon valley bank the bank entered into on july   as last amended on march  the line of credit is collateralized by the company s pharmaceutical and medicare receivables and the amended maximum amount that can be borrowed from the credit line is  as of december   the amount the company can draw from the credit line was equal to the lesser of i the company s calculated borrowing base  which was of certain of the company s accounts receivables  or ii the amount available under the credit line 
as needed from time to time  the company may draw on this line for use for general corporate purposes 
however  the line of credit is subject to various financial covenants and  as of december   the company was not in compliance with certain covenants 
pursuant to the march  amendment  the bank waived the company existing breach of financial covenants under the agreement and the parties restructured the credit line to provide that  among other things i the revolving line of credit maturity date was extended to march   ii the fee for the unused portion of the revolving line of credit was reduced from to per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line of credit  iii the company must continue to meet certain reporting requirements including providing financial statements and a certificate of compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement by an authorized officer to the bank within days of the last day of each calendar quarter  provided that if the company has less than  in its account at the bank at any time during such calendar quarter  the company must provide the financial statements and the certificate of compliance within days of the end of such calendar quarter and providing a monthly report on revenues realized from private payors  iv the financial covenants were amended and restated to require the company to maintain a ratio of quick assets to current liabilities of to and meet certain specified minimum adjusted ebitda requirements as defined in the amendment and measured on a monthly basis and v the bank is granted certain additional inspection of books  records and collateral rights 
the company may fail to comply with these amended financial covenants in due to  for example  the company s calculated borrowing base for a covered period decreasing below a level that the company is in an over advance position in which case  the company will be required to repay any outstanding amounts greater than the calculated borrowing base for such covered period back to the bank immediately 
the company will be able to draw down on the credit line again with respect to such paid back amount once the company is in compliance with the borrowing base requirement 
this occurred on one occasion during the second quarter of based on the may borrowing base  as a result of which the company was required to repay  to the bank 
the company drew down the same amount one week later once the june borrowing base was determined to be sufficiently higher than the may borrowing base  thereby giving the company the capacity to borrow such additional amount 
in addition  we expect to use our capital to fund research and development and to make capital expenditures to keep pace with the expansion of our research and development programs and to scale up our commercial operations 
the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the progress of our product development  regulatory requirements  commercialization efforts  and the amount of cash used by operations 
we expect that we will continue to generate revenue through our pharmacogenomic testing services and responsedx testing services that we provide to pharmaceutical clients and to the users of our responsedx testing services which include oncologists  pathologists  hospitals  and cancer care centers 
these revenues are not guaranteed and are not expected to substantially offset the costs associated with our expansion efforts 
following is a summary of recent events and the expected impact these events have had or may have on our liquidity and future realization of revenues 
sales of common stock under the company s articles of incorporation  the company has one class of common stock and its holders have no preemptive  subscription  redemption or conversion rights 
as described below and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company sold shares of its common stock during and in connection with certain of these offerings  the company entered into registration rights agreements with the purchasers of the common shares 
may registered offering of common stock on may   the company issued  shares of its common stock at a price of per share in a registered direct public offering to certain institutional investors and received net proceeds of approximately million from the sales  after deducting its estimated offering expenses 
the securities issued with this financing were registered under the securities act of  as amended 
the shares were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement dated may  and an accompanying prospectus dated january   pursuant to the company s existing effective shelf registration statement on form s file no 
 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission on december  and declared effective by the sec on january  common stock classified outside of stockholders equity deficit march private placement on march   the company entered into a purchase agreement with certain affiliates of and funds managed by lansdowne partners limited partnership lansdowne  greenway capital partners and paragon associates for the private placement of  newly issued shares of the company s common stock at a per share price of 
the closing of the sale of the shares occurred on march  in connection with the acquisition of the shares  the purchasers were granted certain preemptive rights permitting them to maintain their percentage ownership interests in connection with future issuances of the company s capital stock  subject to various exceptions and limitations 
lansdowne participated in the private placement by electing to exercise the preemptive rights granted to it pursuant to the purchase agreement by and between the company and lansdowne  dated july  net proceeds received from this financing were approximately  in connection with the private placement  the company also entered into a registration rights agreement  dated march   with the purchasers pursuant to which it agreed to file  within days of the closing of the private placement  a registration statement with the sec to register the shares for resale  which registration statement was required to become effective within days following the closing 
the company also granted certain piggyback registration rights to the purchasers which are triggered if the company proposes to file a registration statement for its own account or the account of one or more shareholders until the earlier of the sale of all of the shares or the shares becoming eligible for sale under rule b without restriction 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  dated march   the company filed a registration statement with the sec to register the  shares sold to lansdowne  greenway and paragon for resale  which became effective on may  and which registration statement remained effective as of december  under the registration rights agreements with the purchasers  the company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to i cause the registration statement described above to remain continuously effective and ii to maintain the listing of the company s common stock on nasdaq or other exchanges  as defined  for a period that will terminate on the earlier of march  or the date on which the purchasers have sold all shares of common stock 
the company is also required to file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
in the event the company fails to satisfy its obligations under the registration rights agreements  the company would be in breach of said agreements  in which event  the purchases would be entitled to pursue all rights and remedies at law or equity including an injunction or other equitable relief 
these registration rights agreements do not provide an explicitly stated or defined penalty due upon a breach 
because i the potential penalty for any breach of these registration rights agreement is not explicitly stated or defined  which prohibits the company from applying the guidance of asc  registration payment arrangements and ii complying with all filing requirements under the exchange act as described above is not solely within the company s control  the company is required to present the investment of approximately  in the company s common stock as common stock outside of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under asc s  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
on january   the company removed the restrictions on  shares purchased by lansdowne and reclassified the shares to common stock from common stock classified outside of equity deficit 
therefore  as of december  and  a total of  and  of common stock was classified outside of stockholders equity deficit  respectively 
february private placement on february   the company entered into purchase agreements with various investors collectively  the february investors for the private placement of an aggregate of  newly issued shares of the company s common stock the february shares at a purchase price of per share the february private placement 
net cash proceeds raised in the february private placement were approximately  the february investors participating in the february private placement were various institutions and all officers and directors of the company 
the final closing of the february private placement the february closing occurred on february  in connection with the february private placement  the company also entered into registration rights agreements  each dated february   with the february investors pursuant to which the company agreed to file  within days of the february closing  a registration statement with the sec to register the february shares for resale  which registration statement is required to become effective within days following the february closing 
the company also granted the february investors certain piggyback registration rights  which are triggered if the company proposes to file a registration statement for its own account or the account of one or more shareholders until the earlier of the sale of all of the february shares or the february shares becoming eligible for sale under rule b without restriction 
pursuant to the registration rights agreements dated february   the company filed a registration statement with the sec on april   to register the february shares for resale 
this registration statement became effective on may  and remained effective as of december  under the registration rights agreements with the february investors  the company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to i cause the registration statement described above to remain continuously effective and ii to maintain the listing of the company s common stock on nasdaq or other exchanges  as defined  for a period that will terminate on the earlier of february   the date on which the february investors have sold all covered registrable securities or the date on which there are no longer any covered registrable securities outstanding 
the company is also required to file with the sec in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the company required of the company under the exchange act 
in the event the company fails to satisfy its obligations under the registration rights agreements  the company would be in breach of said agreements  in which event  the february investors would be entitled to pursue all rights and remedies at law or equity including an injunction or other equitable relief 
these registration rights agreements do not provide an explicitly stated or defined penalty due upon a breach 
because i the potential penalty for any breach of these registration rights agreement is not explicitly stated or defined  which prohibits the company from applying the guidance of asc  registration payment arrangements and ii complying with all filing requirements under the exchange act as described above is not solely within the company s control  the company was required to present the investment of approximately  in the company s common stock as common stock outside of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under asc s  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
as of december   the company has removed the restrictions on  shares and reclassified the shares to common stock from common stock classified outside of equity deficit 
therefore  as of december   a total of  of common stock was classified outside of stockholders equity deficit 
september private placement on september   the company entered into a purchase agreement the purchase agreement with glaxo group limited  an affiliate of gsk the gsk investor and two existing investors  swiftcurrent partners  lp and swiftcurrent offshore  ltd 
collectively with the gsk investor  the september investors for the private placement of an aggregate of  newly issued shares of the company s common stock the september shares at a purchase price of per share the september private placement 
the company raised gross cash proceeds of  in the september private placement which closed on september  the closing 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  for so long as the gsk investor or its affiliates own at least of the september shares it purchased pursuant to the purchase agreement  the gsk investor has the right to designate one non voting board observer the board observer 
the board observer  if appointed  has the right to attend all meetings of the board of directors of the company and to receive all board meeting materials  subject to certain restrictions set forth in the purchase agreement 
as of the date hereof  the gsk investor has not exercised its right to designate the board observer 
in connection with the september private placement  the company also entered into a registration rights agreement  dated september  the september registration rights agreement  with the september investors pursuant to which the company agreed to file  within days of the closing  a registration statement with the sec to register the september shares for resale  which registration statement is required to become effective within days following the closing 
the company also granted the september investors certain piggyback registration rights  which are triggered if the company proposes to file a registration statement for its own account or the account of one or more stockholders until the earlier of the sale of all of the september shares or the september shares becoming eligible for sale under rule b without restriction 
under the september registration rights agreement  the company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a registration statement to become effective and to remain continuously effective and to maintain the listing of the covered common stock on nasdaq or other exchanges  as defined  for a period that will terminate upon the earlier of i the date on which all registrable securities covered by such registration statement as amended from time to time  have been sold  ii the date on which there are no longer any registrable securities outstanding or iii three years from the date of filing of such registration statement the effectiveness period and advise each september investor in writing when the effectiveness period has expired 
registrable securities means i the september shares and ii shares of capital stock or any other securities issued or issuable with respect to or in exchange for the september shares  provided  that  a security shall cease to be a registrable security with respect to a september investor upon a sale by such september investor pursuant to a registration statement or rule under the act  or b such security becoming eligible for sale by such september investor without restriction pursuant to rule b 
in the event the company fails to satisfy its obligations under the september registration rights agreement  the company would be in breach of such agreement  in which event  the september investors would be entitled to pursue all rights and remedies at law or equity including an injunction or other equitable relief 
the september registration rights agreement does not provide an explicitly stated or defined penalty due upon a breach 
because the potential penalty for any breach of these registration rights agreement is not explicitly stated or defined  which prohibits the company from applying the guidance of asc  registration payment arrangements  the company was required to present the investment of approximately  in the company s common stock as common stock outside of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under asc s  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
pursuant to the september registration rights agreement  the company filed a registration statement with the sec on october   to register the september shares for resale 
this registration statement became effective on november  and remained effective as of december  as of december   the company has removed the restriction on  of the  september shares and reclassified the shares to common stock from common stock classified outside of stockholders equity deficit 
therefore  as of december   a total of  of common stock relating to the  remaining restricted september shares was classified outside of stockholders equity deficit related to this transaction 
comparison of years ended december  and as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  net working capital of  and an accumulated deficit of  as of december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  net working capital of  and an accumulated deficit of  cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended december   the company used cash flows in operating activities of  compared to  used in the year ended december  the reasons for the increase in cash used in operating activities of  was due mainly to the increase in the net loss  increases in accounts receivable  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by the decreases in prepaid expenses and the increase in deferred revenue 
the increase in accounts receivable related mainly to several large year end invoices related to pharmaceutical client revenues offset by an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses relates primarily to efforts to reduce the purchase of laboratory supplies to better match our immediate needs and the reduction of recruiting costs at year end 
the increase in deferred revenue related to certain services that have been paid in advance and are being provided over a period of time 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this was primarily attributable to the purchase and installation of our laboratory information management system lims 
cash flows used in financing activities cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december  and provided net cash of  and  respectively  primarily relating to the sale of common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements
