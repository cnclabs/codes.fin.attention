item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on rnai 
rnai is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and regulating the expression of specific genes 
since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes  the ability to silence genes selectively through rnai could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases 
we believe that drugs that work through rnai have the potential to become a broad new class of drugs  like small molecule  protein and antibody drugs 
using our intellectual property and the expertise we have built in rnai  we are developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know how that we apply in a systematic way to develop rnai therapeutics for a variety of diseases 
our core product strategy  which we refer to as alnylam x  is focused on the development and commercialization of novel rnai therapeutics for the treatment of genetically defined targets for diseases with high unmet medical need 
under our core product strategy  we expect to have five rnai therapeutic programs in clinical development  including programs in advanced stages  on our own or with one or more collaborators  by the end of as part of this strategy  our goal is to develop product candidates with the following shared characteristics a genetically defined target and disease  the potential to have a significant impact in high unmet need patient populations  the ability to leverage our existing rnai delivery platform  the opportunity to monitor an early biomarker in phase i trials for human proof of concept  and the existence of clinically relevant endpoints for the filing of an nda with a focused patient database and possible accelerated paths for commercialization 
we are currently advancing five core programs in clinical or pre clinical development aln ttr  comprised of aln ttr and aln ttrsc  for the treatment of attr  aln at for the treatment of hemophilia and rbd  aln as for the treatment of aip  aln pcs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia  and aln tmp for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies  including beta thalassemia 
we are also advancing other early stage programs  including aln aat  an rnai therapeutic targeting aat deficiency  for the treatment of aat deficiency associated liver disease 
we intend to focus on developing and commercializing aln ttr  aln ttrsc  aln at and aln as on our own in north and south america  europe and other parts of the world 
in february  we entered into a global alliance with medco to advance our aln pcs program 
we also intend to enter into global alliances to advance our aln tmp  aln aat and potentially other programs 
while focusing our efforts on our core product strategy  we also intend to continue to advance additional development programs through existing or future alliances 
we have two partner based programs in clinical development  including aln rsv for the treatment of rsv and aln vsp for the treatment of liver cancers  as well as one candidate in pre clinical development  aln htt for the treatment of hd 
we also continue to work internally and with third party collaborators with the goal of developing new technologies to deliver our rnai therapeutics both directly to specific sites of disease  and systemically by intravenous or subcutaneous administration 
we have numerous rnai therapeutic delivery collaborations and intend to continue to collaborate with academic and corporate third parties  as well as government entities  to evaluate different delivery options 
in january  we implemented a strategic corporate restructuring pursuant to which we reduced our overall workforce by approximately  to approximately employees 
the goal of the strategic corporate restructuring was to align our resources to focus on what we believe to be our highest value opportunities  including a focus on our lead programs  while advancing other pipeline programs through existing alliances and new collaborations 
the reduction in personnel costs  along with other external costs  resulted in significant savings in our operating expenses 
the workforce reduction was substantially completed at the end of the first quarter of during the three months ended march   we substantially completed the implementation of the strategic corporate restructuring and recorded million of restructuring related costs in operating expenses  including employee severance  benefits and related costs 
we paid substantially all of these restructuring costs during we do not expect to incur any additional significant costs associated with this restructuring 

table of contents in november  we  tpc  protiva and alcana entered into a settlement agreement and general release resolving all ongoing litigation  as well as a patent interference proceeding between us and protiva 
the terms of the settlement agreement include mutual releases and dismissal with prejudice of all claims and counterclaims in connection with all of the litigation pending between the parties 
contemporaneously with the execution of the settlement agreement  we and tekmira restructured our contractual relationship and entered into a cross license agreement that supersedes the prior license and manufacturing agreements among us  tpc and protiva 
in connection with this restructuring  we incurred a million charge to operating expenses for the year ended december  a description of our cross license agreement with tekmira is set forth in part i  item  strategic alliances delivery related licenses and collaborations tekmira of this annual report on form k 
we have incurred significant losses since we commenced operations in and expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
historically  we have generated losses principally from costs associated with research and development activities  acquiring  filing and expanding intellectual property rights and general administrative costs 
as a result of planned expenditures for research and development activities relating to our drug development programs  including the development of drug delivery technologies and clinical trial costs  extension of the capabilities of our technology platform  including through business initiatives  continued management and growth of our patent portfolio  collaborations and general corporate activities  we expect to incur additional operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
therefore  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
although we currently have programs focused on a number of therapeutic areas  we are unable to predict when  if ever  we will successfully develop or be able to commence sales of any product 
to date  a substantial portion of our total net revenues has been derived from collaboration revenues from strategic alliances with roche  takeda  cubist and novartis  and from the united states government in connection with our development of treatments for hemorrhagic fever viruses  including ebola 
we expect our sources of potential funding for the next several years to be derived primarily from new and existing strategic alliances  which may include license and other fees  funded research and development and milestone payments  government and foundation funding  and proceeds from the sale of equity or debt 
in february  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock through an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share 
as a result of this offering  we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses of approximately million 
in january  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock through an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share 
as a result of this offering  we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses of approximately million 
we intend to use the proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes  ultimately focused on advancing our clinical pipeline  in particular our aln ttr  aln ttrsc  aln at and aln as programs  as well as for potential acquisitions of new businesses  technologies or products  working capital  capital expenditures  and general and administrative expenses 
research and development since our inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs 
research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses 
under our core product strategy  we expect to have five rnai therapeutic programs in clinical development by the end of  including programs in advanced stages  on our own or with one or more collaborators 
while focusing our efforts on our core product strategy  we also intend to continue to advance additional partner based development programs through existing or future alliances 
in addition  we continue to work internally and with third party collaborators to develop new technologies to deliver our rnai therapeutics both directly to specific sites of disease  and systemically by intravenous or subcutaneous administration 

table of contents there is a risk that any drug discovery or development program may not produce revenue for a variety of reasons  including the possibility that we will not be able to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate 
moreover  there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery  including rnai 
the successful development of any product candidate we develop is highly uncertain 
due to the numerous risks associated with developing drugs  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows will commence from  any potential product candidate 
these risks include the uncertainty of our ability to discover new product candidates  our ability to progress product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate of progress and cost of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  including those related to developing safe and effective ways of delivering sirnas into cells and tissues  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  clinical trial results  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the terms  timing and success of any collaboration  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost  timing and success of regulatory filings and approvals or potential changes in regulations that govern our industry or the way in which they are interpreted or enforced  the cost and timing of establishing sufficient sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost and timing of establishing sufficient clinical and commercial supplies for any product candidates and products that we may develop  limits on our ability to research  develop  or manufacture our product candidates as a result of contractual obligations to third parties or intellectual property held by third parties  the costs associated with legal activities  including litigation  arising in the course of our business activities and our ability to prevail in any such legal disputes  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of any potential products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and the potential consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
strategic alliances a significant component of our business plan is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies  academic institutions  research foundations and others  as appropriate  to gain access to funding  capabilities  technical resources and intellectual property to further our development efforts and to generate revenues 
we also seek to form or advance new ventures and opportunities in areas outside our primary focus on rnai therapeutics 
to generate revenues from our intellectual property rights  we also grant licenses to biotechnology companies under our interferx program for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics for specified targets in which we have no direct strategic interest 
we also license key aspects of our intellectual 
table of contents property to companies active in the research products and services market  which includes the manufacture and sale of reagents 
we expect our interferx and research product licenses to generate modest near term revenues that we can re invest in the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline 
at january   we had granted such licenses  on both an exclusive and non exclusive basis  to approximately companies 
since delivery of rnai therapeutics remains a major objective of our research activities  we also look to form collaboration and licensing arrangements with other companies and academic institutions to gain access to delivery technologies 
for example  we have entered into agreements with arrowhead  tekmira  mit  ubc and alcana  among others  to focus on various delivery strategies 
we have also entered into license agreements with isis  max planck innovation  tekmira  mit  crt  whitehead and utsw  as well as a number of other entities  to obtain rights to intellectual property in the field of rnai 
finally  we have sought  and may seek in the future  funding for the development of our proprietary rnai therapeutics pipeline from the government and foundations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with with leading pharmaceutical and life sciences companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we have entered into collaboration agreements with novartis  biogen idec  roche arrowhead  takeda  kyowa hakko kirin  cubist  ascletis  monsanto  genzyme and medco 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical and pre clinical development milestones  regulatory milestones  manufacturing services  sales milestones and royalties on product sales 
in january  we adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
the guidance  which applies to multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january   amends the criteria for separating and allocating consideration in a multiple element arrangement by modifying the fair value requirements for revenue recognition and eliminating the use of the residual method 
the fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence is not available 
deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting provided that i a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
the new guidance did not change the criteria for standalone value 
as a biotechnology entity with unique and specialized delivered and undelivered performance obligations  we have been unable to demonstrate standalone value in our multiple element arrangements 
for example  we applied the new rules to collaborations executed with monsanto and genzyme during  but we were unable to demonstrate standalone value 
in addition  we have not materially modified any of our multiple element arrangements 
as such  we will continue to account for our other license and collaboration agreements under previously issued revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements  as described below 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the license only if we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the 
table of contents resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either not have standalone value or have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
we recognize revenue using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method when we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
the amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the proportional performance method  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line method  as of the period ending date 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
many of our collaboration agreements entitle us to additional payments upon the achievement of performance based milestones 
these milestones are generally categorized into three types  development milestones which are generally based on the advancement of our pipeline and initiation of clinical trials  regulatory milestones which are generally based on the submission  filing or approval of regulatory applications such as an nda in the united states  and commercialization milestones which are generally based on meeting specific thresholds of sales in certain geographic areas 
if the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration  the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration  such as upfront fees and research funding  in our revenue model 
milestones that are tied to regulatory approval are not considered probable of being achieved until such approval is received 
milestones tied to counter party performance are not included in our revenue model until the performance conditions are met 
we perform an assessment to determine whether a substantive milestone exists at the inception of our collaborative arrangements 
in evaluating if a milestone is substantive  we consider whether uncertainty exists as to the achievement of the milestone event at the inception of the arrangement  the achievement of the milestone 
table of contents involves substantive effort and can only be achieved based in whole or part on the performance or the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from our performance  the amount of the milestone payment appears reasonable either in relation to the effort expected to be expended or to the projected enhancement of the value of the delivered items  there is any future performance required to earn the milestone  and the consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
when a substantive milestone is achieved  the accounting rules permit us to recognize revenue related to the milestone payment in its entirety 
to date  we have not recorded any substantive milestones under our collaborations because we have not identified any milestones that meet the required criteria listed above 
we have deferred recognition of payments for achievement of non substantive milestones and recognized revenue over the estimated period of performance applicable to each collaborative arrangement 
as these milestones are achieved  we will recognize as revenue a portion of the milestone payment  which is equal to the percentage of the performance period completed  when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment  upon achievement of such milestone 
we will recognize the remaining portion of the milestone payment over the remaining performance period under the proportional performance method or on a straight line basis 
for revenue generating arrangements where we  as a vendor  provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator  as a customer  we apply the accounting standard that governs such transactions 
this standard addresses the accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash payments to each other for services and or products 
a payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
payments to a customer that are deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of revenue  to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to date and probable future revenues  which include any unamortized deferred revenue balances  under all arrangements with such customer  and then as an expense 
payments that are not deemed to be a reduction of selling price are recorded as an expense 
we evaluate our collaborative agreements for proper classification in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss based on the nature of the underlying activity 
transactions between collaborators recorded in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss are recorded on either a gross or net basis  depending on the characteristics of the collaborative relationship 
we generally reflect amounts due under our collaborative agreements related to cost sharing of development activities as a reduction of research and development expense 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short term and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next months 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to the next months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our current operating plan and  if our operating plan should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next month period 
the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
at december   we had short term and long term deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  related to our collaborations 
we recognize revenue under government cost reimbursement contracts as we perform the underlying research and development activities 

table of contents roche arrowhead 
we received aggregate proceeds from roche of million in august  of which million was recorded as deferred revenue in connection with this alliance 
we and roche established a discovery collaboration in october  pursuant to the terms of the roche license and collaboration agreement and subject to our existing contractual obligations to third parties 
in november  roche announced the discontinuation of certain activities in research and early development  including its rnai research efforts 
in october  arrowhead announced its acquisition of rna therapeutics assets from roche  including the license and collaboration agreement 
as a result of the assignment  arrowhead owns all of the rights and obligations of roche under that agreement 
the license is initially limited to four therapeutic areas  and may be expanded to include additional therapeutic areas upon payment to us by arrowhead of an additional million for each additional therapeutic area  if any 
in exchange for our contributions under the collaboration agreement  for each rnai therapeutic product developed by arrowhead  its affiliates or sublicensees under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive milestone payments upon achievement of specified development  regulatory and commercialization events  totaling up to an aggregate of million per therapeutic target  together with a single digit percentage royalty payment based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
the potential future milestone payments for each therapeutic target include up to million for the achievement of specified development milestones  up to million for the achievement of specified regulatory milestones and up to million for the achievement of specified commercialization milestones 
we could potentially earn the next development milestone payment of million under the license and collaboration agreement based upon the initiation of the first phase i clinical trial by arrowhead for an rnai therapeutic product 
for purposes of potential future revenue recognition  we do not believe this milestone or any future milestones are substantive 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from arrowhead 
we determined that the deliverables under these agreements included the license  the alnylam europe assets and employees  the steering committees joint steering committee and future technology committee and the services under the discovery collaboration 
we also determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the license and assets of alnylam europe were not separable from the undelivered services ie  the steering committees and discovery collaboration and  accordingly  the license and the services were treated as a single unit of accounting 
when multiple deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we base our revenue recognition pattern on the final deliverable 
under the arrowhead alliance  the steering committee services and the discovery collaboration services were the final deliverables and all such services ended  contractually  in august  five years from the effective date of the license and collaboration agreement 
we recognized revenue related to these agreements on a straight line basis over five years because we could not reasonably estimate the total level of effort required to complete our service obligations under the license and collaboration agreement  and therefore  could not utilize a proportional performance model 
at december   there was no remaining deferred revenue under the license and collaboration agreement as we recognized all remaining roche arrowhead revenue during the quarter ended september  we will recognize future milestones under the license and collaboration agreement  if any  when such milestones are achieved 
takeda 
in consideration for the rights granted to takeda under the takeda agreement  takeda paid us an upfront payment of million in june and agreed to pay us an additional million upon achievement of specified technology transfer milestones 
of this million  million was paid in october  million was paid in march and million was paid in march if takeda elects to expand its license to additional therapeutic areas  takeda will be required to pay us million for each additional field selected  if any 
in addition  for each rnai therapeutic product developed by takeda  its affiliates and sublicensees  we are entitled to receive specified development  regulatory and commercialization milestone payments  totaling up to million per product  together with up to a double digit percentage royalty payment based on worldwide annual net sales  if any 
the potential future milestone payments per product include up to million for the achievement of specified development milestones  up to million for the achievement of specified regulatory milestones and up to million for the achievement of specified commercialization milestones 
we could potentially earn the next milestone payment of million under the takeda agreement based upon the achievement of a specified pre clinical event by takeda for an rnai therapeutic product 
for purposes of potential future revenue recognition  we do not believe this milestone or any 
table of contents future milestones are substantive 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any additional milestone payments or any royalty payments from takeda 
pursuant to the takeda agreement  we and takeda have also agreed to collaborate on the research of rnai therapeutics directed to one or two disease targets agreed to by the parties  subject to our existing contractual obligations with third parties 
the collaboration is governed by a jttc  a jrcc and a jdcc  each of which is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
we have determined that the deliverables under the takeda agreement include the license  the joint committees the jttc  jrcc and jdcc  the technology transfer activities and the services that we will be obligated to perform under the research collaboration with takeda 
we also have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the license and undelivered services ie  the joint committees and the research collaboration are not separable and  accordingly  the license and services are being treated as a single unit of accounting 
under the takeda agreement  the last elements to be delivered are the jdcc and jttc services  each of which has a life of no more than seven years 
we are recognizing the upfront payment of million and the technology transfer milestones of million  the receipt of which we believed was probable at the commencement of the collaboration  on a straight line basis over seven years because we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of effort to fulfill these obligations  primarily because the effort required under the research collaboration is largely unknown  and therefore  cannot utilize a proportional performance model 
as future milestones are achieved  we will recognize as revenue a portion of the milestone payment equal to the percentage of the performance period completed when the milestone is achieved  multiplied by the amount of the milestone payment 
at december   deferred revenue under the takeda agreement was million 
kyowa hakko kirin 
under the terms of the kyowa hakko kirin agreement  in june  kyowa hakko kirin paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
in addition  kyowa hakko kirin is required to make payments to us upon achievement of specified development and sales milestones totaling up to million  and double digit royalty payments based on annual net sales  if any  of rnai therapeutics for the treatment of rsv by kyowa hakko kirin  its affiliates and sublicenses in the licensed territory 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any additional milestone payments or any royalty payments from kyowa hakko kirin 
our collaboration with kyowa hakko kirin is governed by a joint steering committee that is comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
we are responsible for supply of the product to kyowa hakko kirin under a supply agreement unless kyowa hakko kirin elects  prior to the first commercial sale of the product in the licensed territory  to manufacture the product itself or arrange for a third party to manufacture the product 
we have determined that the deliverables under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement include the license  the joint steering committee  the manufacturing services and any additional rsv specific rnai therapeutic compounds that comprise the aln rsv program 
we have determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the individual deliverables are not separable and  accordingly  must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we are currently unable to reasonably estimate our period of performance under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement  as we are unable to estimate the timeline of our deliverables related to the fixed price option granted to kyowa hakko kirin for any additional compounds 
we are deferring all revenue under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement until we are able to reasonably estimate our period of performance 
we will continue to reassess whether we can reasonably estimate the period of performance to fulfill our obligations under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement 
at december   deferred revenue under the kyowa hakko kirin agreement was million 

table of contents monsanto 
in consideration for the rights granted to monsanto under the monsanto agreement  monsanto paid us million in upfront cash payments 
monsanto is also required to make near term milestone payments to us upon the achievement of specified technology transfer and patent related milestones 
we are also entitled to receive additional funding for collaborative research efforts 
in the aggregate  we can earn up to million in potential future milestone payments and research funding under the monsanto alliance 
in december  we received million of the million in potential milestone payments from monsanto based upon the achievement of a specified patent related event 
in addition  monsanto is required to pay to us a percentage of specified fees from certain sublicense agreements monsanto may enter into that include access to our intellectual property  as well as low single digit royalty payments on worldwide  net sales by monsanto  its affiliates and sublicensees of certain licensed products  as defined in the monsanto agreement  if any 
we could potentially earn the next milestone payment of million under the monsanto agreement based upon the completion of technology transfer activities 
for purposes of potential future revenue recognition  we do not believe this milestone or any future milestones are substantive 
due to the uncertainty of the application of rnai technology in the field of agriculture  we may not receive any additional milestone payments or any royalty payments from monsanto 
under the terms of the monsanto agreement  in the event that during the exclusivity period monsanto loses certain patent rights  and such loss has a material adverse effect on the licensed products  then we would be required to pay monsanto up to million as liquidated damages  and monsanto s royalty obligations to us under the monsanto agreement would be reduced or  under certain circumstances  terminated 
we have the right to cure any such loss of patent rights under the monsanto agreement 
we have determined that the significant deliverables under the monsanto agreement include the license  the technology transfer activities and the services that we will be obligated to perform under the monsanto discovery collaboration 
we have also determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the license and undelivered technical transfer activities and monsanto discovery collaboration services do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the services to be provided by us 
in addition  while monsanto has the ability to grant sublicenses  it cannot grant access to certain of our proprietary technology 
the uniqueness of our services and the limited sublicense right are indicators that standalone value is not present in the arrangement 
therefore the deliverables are not separable and  accordingly  the license and undelivered technical transfer activities and monsanto discovery collaboration services are being treated as a single unit of accounting 
when multiple deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we base our revenue recognition model on the final deliverable 
under the monsanto agreement  the last deliverable to be completed is the monsanto discovery collaboration  which must be completed within five years 
we are recognizing revenue under the monsanto agreement on a straight line basis over five years 
we are not utilizing a proportional performance model since we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of effort to fulfill these obligations  primarily because the effort required under the monsanto discovery collaboration is largely unknown 
genzyme 
in consideration for the rights granted to genzyme under the genzyme agreement  genzyme paid us an upfront cash payment of million 
upon achievement of certain milestones  we will be entitled to receive milestone payments  up to an aggregate of million  including up to million in specified development milestones and million in specified regulatory milestones 
in addition  we will be entitled to tiered royalties expected to yield an effective royalty rate percentage ranging from the mid teens to mid twenties based on annual net sales  if any  of licensed products in the genzyme territory by genzyme  its affiliates and sublicensees 
we could potentially earn the next development milestone payment of million under the genzyme agreement based upon the completion of a successful phase ii aln ttr clinical trial  as defined in the genzyme agreement 
for purposes of potential future revenue recognition  we do not believe this milestone or any future milestones are substantive 
due to the uncertainty of pharmaceutical development and the high historical failure rates generally associated with drug development  we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments from genzyme 

table of contents under the genzyme agreement  the parties will collaborate in the development of licensed products  with genzyme assuming primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of licensed products in the genzyme territory and us retaining primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of licensed products in the rest of the world 
the collaboration between genzyme and us is governed by a joint steering committee that will be comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
genzyme is responsible  at its expense  for all development activities under the development plan that are reasonably necessary for the regulatory approval and commercialization of an rnai therapeutic for the treatment of attr in the genzyme territory 
the genzyme agreement originally provided that if development of a licensed product was terminated by us or genzyme under certain limited circumstances  genzyme would have the right to terminate the genzyme agreement and we would be required to refund amounts paid by genzyme to us under the agreement prior to such termination 
on february   we and genzyme agreed to amend the genzyme agreement to remove this provision 
we have determined that the deliverables under the genzyme agreement include the license  the joint steering committee and any additional ttr specific rnai therapeutic compounds that comprise the aln ttr program 
we also determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the license and undelivered joint steering committee and any additional ttr specific rnai therapeutic compounds do not have standalone value due to the specialized nature of the services to be provided by us 
in addition  while genzyme has the ability to grant sublicenses  it cannot sublicense all or substantially all of its rights under the genzyme agreement 
the uniqueness of our services and the limited sublicense right are indicators that standalone value is not present in the arrangement 
therefore the deliverables are not separable and  accordingly  the license and undelivered services are being treated as a single unit of accounting 
we are currently unable to reasonably estimate our period of performance under the genzyme agreement  as we are unable to estimate the timeline of our deliverables related to the option granted to genzyme for any additional compounds 
we are deferring all revenue under the genzyme agreement until we are able to reasonably estimate our period of performance 
we will continue to reassess whether we can reasonably estimate the period of performance to fulfill our obligations under the genzyme agreement 
cubist 
in january  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with cubist to develop and commercialize therapeutic products based on certain of our rnai technology for the treatment of rsv 
licensed products initially included aln rsv  as well as several other second generation rnai based rsv inhibitors 
in november  we and cubist entered into an amendment to our license and collaboration agreement  which provided that we and cubist would focus our collaboration and joint development efforts on aln rsv  a second generation compound  intended for use in pediatric patients 
in december  we and cubist jointly made a portfolio decision to put the development of aln rsv on hold 
pursuant to the terms of the amendment  we continued to develop aln rsv for adult transplant patients at our sole discretion and expense and cubist had the right to opt into collaborating with us on aln rsv  subject to specified conditions 
in february  cubist notified us that it would not exercise its opt in right for aln rsv in light of this determination  we and cubist mutually agreed to terminate the license and collaboration agreement effective as of february  as of the effective date  the parties have no further rights and obligations under the license and collaboration agreement  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the agreement 
under the terms of the cubist agreement  we and cubist shared responsibility for developing licensed products in north america and each was responsible for one half of the related development costs  subject to the terms of the november amendment 
our collaboration with cubist for the development of licensed products in north america was governed by a joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party 
cubist had the sole right to commercialize licensed products in north america with costs associated with such activities and any resulting profits or losses to be split equally between us and cubist 
in consideration for the rights granted to cubist under the agreement  in january  cubist paid us an upfront cash payment of million 

table of contents we determined that the deliverables under the cubist agreement included the licenses  technology transfer related to the aln rsv program  the joint steering committee and the development and manufacturing services that we were obligated to perform during the development period 
we also determined that  pursuant to the accounting guidance governing revenue recognition on multiple element arrangements  the licenses and undelivered services were not separable and  accordingly  the licenses and services were treated as a single unit of accounting 
under the cubist agreement  the last element expected to be delivered was the development and manufacturing services  which had an expected life of approximately eight years 
we were recognizing the upfront payment of million on a straight line basis over approximately eight years because we were unable to reasonably estimate the level of effort to fulfill our performance obligations  and therefore  could not utilize a proportional performance model 
at december   deferred revenue under the cubist agreement was million 
as a result of the termination of the cubist agreement in february and the end of our performance obligations thereunder  we expect to recognize the remaining deferred revenue of million during the first quarter of accounting for income taxes we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
our policy is to accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in income tax expense 
as of december   we have not recorded significant interest and penalty expense related to uncertain tax positions 
we operate in the united states and germany where our income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change  and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
we develop our cumulative probability assessment of the measurement of uncertain tax positions using internal experience  judgment and assistance from professional advisors 
we refine estimates as we become aware of additional information 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from our current estimate may result in additional tax expense in future periods 
at december   we had no unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably impact our effective income tax rate in future periods 
we recognize income taxes when transactions are recorded in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss  with deferred taxes provided for items that are recognized in different periods for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we estimate our exposures relating to uncertain tax positions and establish reserves for such exposures when they become probable and reasonably estimable 
for the year ended december   we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of zero and million  respectively 
the benefit of million for the year ended december  is due to the recognition of corresponding income tax expense  recorded in other comprehensive income  associated with the increase in the value of our investment in regulus that we carried at fair market value during the same period 
at december   we had a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  to reduce future taxable income that will expire at various dates through at december   we had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to reduce future tax liabilities that expire at various dates through at december   we had foreign tax credit carryforwards of million available to reduce future tax liabilities that expire in at december   we had alternative minimum tax credits of million available to reduce future regular tax liabilities to the extent such regular tax less other non refundable credits exceeds the tentative minimum tax 
we have a valuation allowance against the net operating loss and credit deferred tax assets as it is unlikely that we will realize these assets 
ownership changes  as defined in the internal revenue code  including those resulting from the issuance of common stock in 
table of contents connection with our public offerings  may limit the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income or tax liability 
the amount of the limitation is determined in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
we have determined that based on our value  in the event there was an annual limitation under section  all net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would still be available to offset taxable income 
accounting for stock based compensation we have stock incentive plans and an employee stock purchase plan under which we grant equity instruments 
we account for all stock based awards granted to employees at their fair value and generally recognize compensation expense over the vesting period of the award 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of our publicly traded stock 
for stock option awards granted during the year ended december   we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility assumption of 
our expected life assumption is based on our historical data 
our weighted average expected term was years for the year ended december  we utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and currently have no intention to pay cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life 
for stock based awards granted to non employees  we generally recognize compensation expense over the vesting period of the award  which is generally the period during which services are rendered by such non employees 
at the end of each financial reporting period prior to vesting  we re measure the value of these stock based awards as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model using the then current fair value of our common stock 
stock options granted to non employees  other than members of our board of directors and scientific advisory board members  generally vest over the service period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards granted to employees is based upon the quoted closing market price per share on the date of grant  adjusted for assumed forfeitures 
for performance based restricted stock awards  the value of the awards is measured when we determine the achievement of such performance conditions is deemed probable 
this determination requires significant judgment by management 
expense is recognized over the vesting period  commencing when we determine that it is probable that the awards will vest 
at december   the estimated fair value of unvested employee awards was million  net of estimated forfeitures 
we will recognize this amount over the weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately years for these awards 
stock based employee compensation expense was million for the year ended december  however  we cannot currently predict the total amount of stock based compensation expense to be recognized in any future period because such amounts will depend on levels of stock based payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the awards that actually vest 
the stock compensation accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  excluding the impact of our corporate restructurings  that approximately of our stock options will actually vest  and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested employee stock options at december  ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
accounting for joint venture from the formation of regulus in september to october  we accounted for our interest in regulus using the equity method of accounting 
we reviewed the consolidation guidance that defines a variable interest entity  or vie  and concluded that regulus qualified as a vie during such time period 
we recorded any 
table of contents gains or losses recognized from the issuance of stock by its equity method investee as other income expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
we did not consolidate regulus financial results as we lacked the power to direct the activities that could significantly impact the economic success of regulus 
under equity method accounting  because we had guaranteed the debt of regulus  we were required to continue to recognize our share of any future losses which resulted in the carrying amount of our investment in regulus to be reduced below zero 
in october  regulus completed an initial public offering  resulting in our ownership percentage decreasing from approximately to of regulus outstanding common stock 
based upon our new ownership percentage of  as well as qualitative factors  we do not believe that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating decisions and financial policies of regulus and have therefore discontinued the equity method of accounting for regulus 
accordingly  beginning in october  we accounted for our investment in regulus as an available for sale marketable security 
for additional details on the accounting for our investment in regulus  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
estimated liability for development costs we record accrued liabilities related to expenses for which service providers have not yet billed us with respect to products or services that we have received  specifically related to ongoing pre clinical studies and clinical trials 
these costs primarily relate to third party clinical management costs  laboratory and analysis costs  toxicology studies and investigator fees 
we have multiple product candidates in concurrent pre clinical studies and clinical trials at multiple clinical sites throughout the world 
in order to ensure that we have adequately provided for ongoing pre clinical and clinical development costs during the period in which we incur such costs  we maintain an accrual to cover these expenses 
we update our estimate for this accrual on at least a quarterly basis 
the assessment of these costs is a subjective process that requires judgment 
upon settlement  these costs may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from our actual costs 
results of operations the following data summarizes the results of our operations for the periods indicated  in thousands year ended december  net revenues from research collaborators operating expenses loss from operations net loss the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  resulted from a million charge to operating expenses in connection with the restructuring of our license agreement with tekmira in november  which is described below under the heading restructuring of tekmira licensing agreement 
discussion of results of operations for and net revenues from research collaborators we generate revenues through research collaborations 
the following table summarizes our total consolidated net revenues from research collaborators  for the periods indicated  in thousands year ended december  roche arrowhead takeda monsanto other total net revenues from research collaborators 
table of contents net revenues from research collaborators declined for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to the completion of our remaining performance obligations under the roche arrowhead alliance in august as a result of the termination of the cubist agreement in february and the end of our performance obligations thereunder  we expect to recognize the remaining deferred revenue under the cubist agreement of million during the first quarter of we expect net revenues from research collaborators to decrease significantly during on a comparative basis due to the completion of our remaining performance obligations under the roche arrowhead alliance in the third quarter of we also had million of deferred revenue at december   which consists of payments we have received from collaborators  primarily takeda  kyowa hakko kirin  cubist  monsanto and genzyme  but have not yet recognized pursuant to our revenue recognition policies 
for the foreseeable future  we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from our alliances with takeda and monsanto  and other strategic alliances  as well as new collaborations  foundation funding  government contracts and licensing activities

table of contents research and development expenses decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to lower clinical trial and manufacturing expenses related to our aln rsv  aln pcs and aln vsp programs and decreases in compensation related expenses 
partially offsetting these decreases were additional expenses related to the advancement of our aln ttr program  as well as license fees due to certain entities  primarily fees due to isis as a result of the monsanto and genzyme alliances 
also included in the year ended december  is a one time charge related to our january strategic corporate restructuring  including employee severance  benefits and other related costs 
we expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development expenses as we continue development of our and our collaborators product candidates and focus on continuing to develop drug delivery related technologies 
we expect that research and development expenses will remain consistent in a significant portion of our research and development costs are not tracked by project as they benefit multiple projects or our technology platform and because our most advanced programs are not yet in late stage clinical development 
however  our collaboration agreements contain cost sharing arrangements pursuant to which certain costs incurred under the project are reimbursed 
costs reimbursed under the agreements typically include certain direct external costs and a negotiated full time equivalent labor rate for the actual time worked on the project 
in addition  we have been reimbursed under government contracts for certain allowable costs including direct internal and external costs 
as a result  although a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project by project basis  we do track direct external costs attributable to  and the actual time our employees worked on  our collaborations and government contracts

also included in the year ended december  is a one time charge related to our january strategic corporate restructuring  including employee severance  benefits and other related costs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in all compensation expenses and facilities related expenses due primarily to the reduction in workforce in connection with the january strategic corporate restructuring 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease significantly in  due primarily to lower consulting and professional services related to legal activities 
restructuring of tekmira license agreement 
for the year ended december   we incurred a million charge to operating expenses in connection with the restructuring of our license agreement with 
table of contents tekmira in november specifically  we made a one time payment of million to tekmira for the termination of  and our release from  all of our obligations under the manufacturing agreement with tpc  including without limitation the obligations to obtain materials and or services from tpc 
further  we elected to buy down certain future potential milestone and royalty payments due to tekmira for certain of our rnai therapeutics  formulated using lnp technology 
specifically  pursuant to the cross license agreement  we made a one time payment of million to tekmira  which amount constituted payment for the termination of the license agreements with tpc and protiva and the parties rights and obligations thereunder  as well as the buy down of certain milestone payments and the significant reduction of royalty rates for aln vsp  aln pcs and aln ttr 
in addition  under the cross license agreement  we will be obligated to pay tpc an aggregate of million in contingent milestone payments related to advancement of aln vsp and aln ttr  which now represent the only potential milestones due to tekmira for aln vsp  aln pcs and aln ttr lnp based rnai therapeutics 
specifically  we will be obligated to pay tpc a million milestone payment upon each of i the initiation of a phase iii clinical trial of an lnp based aln ttr therapeutic  and ii the manufacture of aln vsp clinical trial material for use in china

other income expense we incurred million equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  related to our share of the net losses incurred by regulus 
interest income was million in as compared to million in the decrease in was due primarily to lower average interest rates as well as lower average cash  cash equivalent and fixed income marketable securities balances 
other income was million in due primarily to a gain recorded in connection with the issuance of common stock by regulus 
in october  regulus completed an initial public offering  resulting in the company s ownership percentage decreasing from approximately to of regulus outstanding common stock 
as a result of this issuance of stock by regulus  we recognized a gain of million 
other expense in was million and was due primarily to an impairment charge related to our former investment in tekmira equity securities  as the decrease in the fair value of this investment was deemed to be other than temporary 
our benefit in income taxes was million in as compared to zero for the increase in was due to our recognition of corresponding income tax benefit associated with the increase in the value of our investment in regulus that we carried at fair market value during the same respective period

cash used in operating activities is adjusted for non cash items to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by or used in operating activities 
these non cash adjustments consist primarily of stock based compensation  equity in loss of joint venture regulus therapeutics inc and depreciation and amortization 
we expect that we will require significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and advance our research and development initiatives 
the actual amount of overall expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of expenses  the timing and terms of collaboration agreements or other strategic transactions  if any  and the timing and progress of our research and development efforts

operating capital requirements we do not know when  if ever  we will successfully develop or be able to commence sales of any product 
therefore  we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses for the foreseeable future as a result of planned expenditures for research and development activities relating to our drug development programs  including the development of drug delivery technologies and clinical trial costs  extension of the capabilities of our technology platform  including through business initiatives  continued management and growth of our patent portfolio  collaborations and general corporate activities 
in february  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock through an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share

based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and fixed 
table of contents income marketable securities  together with the cash we expect to generate under our current alliances  will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through at least the end of for reasons discussed below  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to develop  conduct clinical trials for and commercialize any product candidates 
in the future  we may seek additional funding through additional collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
in december  we filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement with the sec for an indeterminate number of shares 
during the recent downturn in global financial markets  some companies have experienced difficulties raising capital  which has had a material adverse impact on their liquidity 
the recent economic downturn has diminished the availability of capital and may limit our ability to access these markets to obtain financing in the future 
as a result of these and other factors  additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any additional financing may further adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
in addition  as a condition to providing additional funds to us  future investors may demand  and may be granted  rights superior to those of existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly delay or curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise pursue 
even if we are able to raise additional funds in a timely manner  our future capital requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on many factors  including our progress in demonstrating that sirnas can be active as drugs  our ability to develop relatively standard procedures for selecting and modifying sirna product candidates  progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the timing  receipt and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  from present and future collaborators  if any  the timing  receipt and amount of funding under future government or foundation contracts  if any  our ability to maintain and establish additional collaborative arrangements and or new business initiatives  the resources  time and costs required to successfully initiate and complete our pre clinical and clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals  and obtain and maintain licenses to third party intellectual property  our ability to manufacture  or contract with third parties for the manufacture of  our product candidates for clinical testing and commercial sale  the resources  time and cost required for the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance and enforcement of patent claims  our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions as a result of  and to successfully manage the potential impact of  our january strategic corporate restructuring and workforce reduction on our culture  collaborative relationships and business operations  the costs associated with legal activities  including litigation  arising in the course of our business activities and our ability to prevail in any such legal disputes  progress in the research and development programs of regulus  and the timing  receipt and amount of sales and royalties  if any  from our potential products

because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table

recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued a new accounting standard that clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
this standard is effective 
table of contents on a prospective basis for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after december  we adopted this amendment on january  the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  a company may present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in either case  a company is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income 
for public companies  the amendment is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively 
we adopted this amendment on january  other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement 
in february  the fasb issued amendments to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income  but do require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where the net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about these amounts 
for public companies  these amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  other than a change in presentation  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
our fixed income marketable securities consist of us government obligations  high grade corporate notes and commercial paper 
all of our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
our available for sale investments in debt securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in the credit ratings of the issuers 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points  or one half of a percentage point  from levels at december   the net fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments would have resulted in a hypothetical decline of million 
a downgrade in the credit rating of an issuer of a debt security or further deterioration of the credit markets could result in a decline in the fair value of the debt instruments 
our investment guidelines prohibit investment in auction rate securities and we do not believe we have any direct exposure to losses relating from mortgage based securities or derivatives related thereto such as credit default swaps 
we did not record any impairment charges to our fixed income marketable securities during the year ended december
