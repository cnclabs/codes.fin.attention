item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview magyar bancorp  inc the company is a delaware chartered mid tier stock holding company whose most significant business activity is ownership of of the common stock of magyar bank 
magyar bank s principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits  together with funds generated from operations  principal repayments on loans and securities and borrowed funds  into one to four family residential mortgage loans  multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  commercial business loans and construction loans 
our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest income is primarily affected by the market interest rate environment  the shape of the us treasury yield curve  the timing of the placement of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets 
other factors that may affect our results of operations are general and local economic and competitive conditions  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
on april   the bank entered into agreements with the federal deposit insurance corporation and the new jersey department of banking and insurance which required the bank to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness 
in connection with these agreements  the bank stipulated to the issuance of consent orders against the bank the consent orders relating to certain findings from a recent examination of the bank 
in entering into the stipulation and consenting to entry of the consent orders  the bank did not concede the findings or admit to any of the assertions therein 
the consent orders imposed no fines or penalties upon the bank 
among the corrective actions required were for the bank to develop a written capital plan that detailed the manner in which the bank would achieve a tier capital as a percentage of the bank total assets of at least  and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets of at least 
on march  the bank was informed in writing by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the new jersey department of banking and insurance  that the consent order had been terminated 
the bank is required to maintain tier capital as a percentage of the bank total assets of at least  and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets of at least 
at september   magyar bank s tier capital as a percentage of the bank total assets was and the total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets was 

table of contents during the year ended september   net loans increased million  or  due to growth in commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
in addition  investment securities increased million  or  as strong deposit inflows were invested in us government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations 
growth in non interest bearing checking balances led to a million  or  increase in total deposits during the year ended september  the strong inflows led to reductions in borrowings of million  or  and balances of interest bearing deposits of million  or  reflecting the bank s continued strategy of shifting funding sources from higher cost deposits and borrowings to non interest bearing checking accounts  which increased million  or 
the shift in funding helped contribute to a million  or  decrease in the company s interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  we attribute the decrease in the average interest expense to the expansion of our commercial relationships  which tend to hold larger deposit balances  successful business development efforts by our retail branch managers  and the continued growth of the bank s two newest branch facilities 
the company reported net income of  for the year ended september  net income decreased  compared with a net income of  for the year ended september   attributable to lower gains from sales of assets  which decreased  between the periods 
loan loss provisions increased  to million during the year ended september  compared with million for the year ended september  due to higher level of loan charge offs and the increase in the total loan receivables during the current period  but were offset by higher net interest and dividend income  which increased  to million  and by lower non interest expenses  which decreased  to million 
throughout  we expect to continue reducing non performing assets  diversifying our balance sheet with higher concentrations in commercial real estate and commercial business loans  and managing non interest expenses in order to increase profitability of the company 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies may involve complex subjective decisions or assessments 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan loss 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover credit losses in the loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical 
due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses  the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management 
as a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
the assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  delinquency statistics  geographic and industry concentrations  the adequacy of the underlying collateral  the financial strength of the borrower  results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 

table of contents the evaluation has a specific and general component 
the specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as impaired through the application of our loan review process and our loan grading system 
all such loans are evaluated individually  with principal consideration given to the value of the collateral securing the loan and discounted cash flows 
specific impairment allowances are established as required by this analysis 
however  the bank s federal and state regulators generally require that the specific reserve against impaired collateral dependent loans be charged off  reducing the carrying balance of the loan and allowance for loan loss 
the general component is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
we analyze historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations in establishing the general portion of the reserve 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses 
actual loan losses may be significantly greater than the allowances we have established  which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
deferred income taxes 
the company records income taxes using the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities i are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns  ii are attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and iii are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance for all portions determined not likely to be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period of enactment 
the valuation allowance is adjusted  by a charge or credit to income tax expense  as changes in facts and circumstances warrant 
comparison of financial condition at september  and september total assets 
total assets increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  the increase was attributable to a million  or  increase in deposits  which were used to reduce borrowings million  fund loan growth of million  and increase investment securities by million 
loans receivable 
total loans receivable increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  during the year ended september   commercial real estate loans increased million  or  to million  commercial business loans increased million  or  to million and other loans increased  or  to million 
residential mortgage loans decreased million  or  to million  home equity lines of credit loans decreased million  or  to million  and construction loans decreased million  or  to million at september  at september   the significant loan categories in terms of the percent of total loans were in commercial real estate loans and in one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the remaining categories were comprised of in commercial business loans  and in home equity lines of credit and other loans  which consisted primarily of stock secured consumer loans and in construction loans 
total non performing loans decreased million to million at september  from million at september  non performing loans consisted of five construction loan relationships totaling million  thirty two residential mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential properties totaling million  six commercial real estate loans totaling million  seven home equity lines of credit loans totaling  and two commercial business loan totaling  adverse economic conditions have led to historically high levels of non performing loans  particularly in the company s construction loan portfolio 
the repayment of construction loans is typically dependent upon the sale of the collateral securing the loan  which has been negatively impacted by significant deterioration in the housing market and decreased buyer demand 
as a result  construction projects have slowed and reached their maturity dates 
in order for the company to extend the loans beyond the original maturity date  the value of the collateral securing the loan must be assessed  which is typically done by obtaining an updated third party appraisal 
to the extent that the current appraised value of collateral is insufficient to cover a collateral dependent loan  the company reduces the balance of the loan via a charge to the allowance for loan loss 

table of contents non performing loans secured by one to four family residential properties  including home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans  increased  to million at september  from million at september  magyar bank had begun foreclosure proceedings on the majority of the properties as of september  foreclosure of owner occupied residential properties in the state of new jersey can take several years

during the year ended september   magyar bank charged off million in non performing construction loan balances through a reduction of its allowance for loan loss 
construction loans may contain interest reserves on which the interest is capitalized 
at september   there were two performing construction loans with interest reserves representing outstanding balances of million  an original interest reserve of  an advanced interest reserve of  and a remaining interest reserve balance of  underwriting for construction loans with and without interest reserves has followed a uniform process 
construction loan progress is monitored by loan on a monthly basis by management of the bank as well as by the board of directors 
each time an advance is requested  an inspection is made of the project by an outside engineer or appraiser  depending on the size and complexity of the project  to determine the amount of work completed and if the costs to date are supported adequately 
the bank s construction loan operations personnel compare the advance request with the original budget and remaining loan funds available to ensure the project is in balance and that at all times the amount remaining on the loan is sufficient to complete the project 
a number of the bank s construction loans have been extended due to slower sales as a result of worsening economic conditions 
in cases where updated appraisals reflect collateral values insufficient to cover the loan  additional collateral and or a principal reduction is required to extend the loan 
some of the bank s loans that originally had interest reserves are non performing 
the bank does not currently have any non performing loans with active interest reserves 
once a loan is deemed impaired  any interest reserve is frozen and the loan is placed on non accrual so that no future interest income is recorded on these loans

we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to earnings  at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  peer group information and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events occur 
after an evaluation of these factors  management made a provision of million for the year ended september  compared with a million provision for the prior year 
provisions for loan loss for the year ended september  increased  from the prior year period due to higher levels of loan charge offs and the increase in loans 
net charge offs totaled million for the year ended september  compared to net charge offs of million for the year ended september  the higher level of loan charge offs resulted from new loans deemed impaired during the period and updated valuations of collateral securing previously impaired loans

the allowance for loan losses decreased  to million  or of gross loans outstanding at september   from million  or of gross loans outstanding at september  the decrease in allowance for loan loss as a percentage of gross loans outstanding between periods was due to lower specific reserves held at september  compared with september other income 
non interest income decreased  or  to million during the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  non interest income declined due to lower service charge income  which decreased  and lower gains on the sales of assets  which were  for the twelve months ended september  compared with  for the twelve months ended september  the company s gains on the sales of mortgage loans decreased  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  the company s gains from the sales of investment securities decreased  to  for the year ended september  from  for the year ended september  other expenses

the effective tax rates were and for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for compared to was the result of tax free income and the increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance making up a higher percentage of pre tax income for the current year  resulting in a lower effective tax rate 
management of market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an asset and liability management committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset and liability committee meets at least on a quarterly basis to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by retaining in our loan portfolio fewer fixed rate residential loans  by originating and retaining adjustable rate loans in the residential  construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios  by using alternative funding sources  such as advances from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny  to match fund longer term residential and commercial mortgage loans  and by originating and retaining variable rate home equity and short term and medium term fixed rate commercial business loans 
we have also increased money market account deposits as a percentage of our total deposits 
money market accounts offer a variable rate based on market indications 
finally  we have purchased interest rate floors and sold securities under agreements to repurchase with embedded derivatives to mitigate the impact of interest rates on our prime based loans 
at september  we held securities sold under agreements to repurchase with embedded derivatives in the amount of million 
by following these strategies  we believe that we are well positioned to react to changes in market interest rates 
net interest income analysis 
the table below sets forth  as of september   the estimated changes in our net interest income nii for each of the next two years that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in interest rates 
these estimates require making certain assumptions including loan and mortgage related investment prepayment speeds  reinvestment rates  and deposit maturities and decay rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  we cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ significantly due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions 
further  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
change in estimated decrease estimated decrease interest rates estimated in nii year estimated in nii year basis points nii year amount percentage nii year amount percentage dollars in thousands unchanged   assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments and maturities and sales of securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we seek to maintain a liquidity ratio of of assets or greater 
the liquidity ratio is calculated by determining the sum of the difference between liquid assets cash and unpledged investment securities and short term liabilities estimated day deposit outflows  borrowing capacity from the fhlbny  and brokered deposit capacity and dividing the sum by total assets 
at september   our liquidity ratio was of assets 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity from sales  totaled million at september  at september   we also had the ability to borrow million from the federal home loan bank of new york 
on that date  we had an aggregate of million in advances outstanding 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our statements of cash flows included in our financial statements 
at september   we had million in loan origination commitments outstanding 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had million in unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled million  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before september  we believe  however  that based on past experience a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities 
we originated and million of loans and purchased and million of securities for the year ended september  and  respectively 
financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we experienced a net increase in total deposits of million for the year ended september  and a net decrease in total deposits of million for the year ended september  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlbny  which provide an additional source of funds 
federal home loan bank advances totaled million and million at september  and september   respectively 
federal home loan bank advances have primarily been used to fund loan demand 
magyar bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a commitment to maintain tier capital as a percentage of the bank total assets of at least  and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets of at least see supervision and regulation federal banking regulation capital requirements 
as of september   magyar bank s tier capital as a percentage of the bank total assets was and the total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets was 
bank owned life insurance is a tax advantaged financing transaction that is used to offset employee benefit plan costs 
policies are purchased insuring directors and officers of magyar bank using a single premium method of payment 
magyar bank is the owner and beneficiary of the policies and records tax free income through cash surrender value accumulation 
we have minimized our credit exposure by choosing carriers that are highly rated and limiting the concentration of any one carrier 
the investment in bank owned life insurance has no significant impact on our capital and liquidity 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by us
