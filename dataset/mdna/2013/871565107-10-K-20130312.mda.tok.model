item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintained allowances for doubtful accounts of  as of december   for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and for disputed claims and quality issues 
the allowance is based upon a review of outstanding receivables  historical collection information and existing economic conditions 
the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral 
receivables are generally due within to days 
delinquent receivables are written off based on individual credit evaluations and specific circumstances of the customer 
inventory reserves the company establishes a reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and current market conditions 
based on historical results  the company also maintains an inventory reserve to provide for the amount of estimated inventory quantity loss since the last physical inventory 
as of december   the company has  accrued for inventory obsolescence and market reserves 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
environmental reserves as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  the company has accrued  as of december   in environmental remediation costs which  in management best estimate  are sufficient to satisfy anticipated costs of known remediation requirements as explained in note expenditures related to costs currently accrued are not discounted to their present values and are expected to be made over the next three to four years 
however  as a result of the evolving nature of the environmental regulations  the difficulty in estimating the extent and necessary remediation of environmental contamination  and the availability and application of technology  the estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are subject to uncertainties and it is not possible to predict the amount or timing of future costs of environmental matters which may subsequently be determined 
changes in information known to management or in applicable regulations may require the company to record additional remediation reserves 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances  also referred to as triggering events  indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset or group of assets the assets may no longer be recoverable 
triggering events include a significant decline in the market price of the assets  a significant adverse change in the operating use or physical condition of the assets  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate impacting the assets value  including regulatory issues such as environmental actions  the generation by the assets of historical cash flow losses combined with projected future cash flow losses  or the expectation that the assets will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of the useful life of the assets 
the company concluded that there were no indications of impairment requiring further testing during the year ended december  if the company concluded that  based on its review of current facts and circumstances  there were indications of impairment  testing of the applicable assets would be performed 
the recoverability of the assets to be held and used is tested by comparing the carrying amount of the assets at the date of the test to the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets over the remaining useful life of the assets 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows  the company uses projections of cash flows directly associated with  and which are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
this approach requires significant judgments including the company projected net cash flows  which are derived using the most recent available estimate for the reporting unit containing the assets tested 
several key assumptions would include periods of operation  projections of product pricing  production levels  product costs  market supply and demand  and inflation 
if it is determined that the carrying amount of the assets are not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their fair value 
assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until the assets are disposed or use has ceased 
goodwill the company has goodwill of  recorded as part of its acquisition of manufacturers soap and chemical company  operating within the chemicals segment   recorded as part of its acquisition of ram fab  inc and  recorded as part of its current year acquisition of palmer  both operating within the metals segment 
goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired  is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is recorded  with its carrying amount 
if the reporting unit fair value exceeds its carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized and the second step  which is a calculation of the impairment  is not performed 
however  if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge equal to the difference in the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill is recorded 
implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts allocated to assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
in making our determination of fair value of the reporting unit  we rely on the discounted cash flow method 
this method uses projections of cash flows from the reporting unit 
this approach requires significant judgments including the company projected net cash flows  the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount the cash flows and terminal value assumptions 
we derive these assumptions used in the testing from several sources 
many of these assumptions are derived from our internal budgets  which would include existing sales data based on current product lines and assumed production levels  manufacturing costs and product pricing 
we believe that our internal forecasts are consistent with those that would be used by a potential buyer in valuing our reporting units 
the wacc rate is based on an average of the capital structure  cost of capital and inherent business risk profiles of the company 
the assumptions used in the valuation are interrelated 
the continuing degree of interrelationship of these assumptions is  in and of itself a significant assumption 
because of the interrelationships among the assumptions  we do not believe it would be meaningful to provide a sensitivity analysis on any of the individual assumptions 
however  one key assumption in our valuation model is the wacc 
if the wacc  which is used to discount the projected cash flows  were higher  the measure of the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit would decrease 
conversely  if the wacc were lower  the measure of the fair value of the net assets of the reporting unit would increase 
changes in any of the company other estimates could also have a material effect on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit assets 
based on the company goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of  each reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value  therefore no further testing was required and no impairment loss was recognized 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities during totaled  and cash flows used in operating activities in totaled  an improvement in cash flows of  cash flows in were generated from net income totaling  before depreciation and amortization expense of  since the company acquired palmer on august   cash flows resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities cannot be determined simply by subtracting balance sheet amounts from values 
the net value of all assets and liabilities acquired are shown in the acquisition of palmer of texas line in the investing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows 
accordingly  these individual acquired balances represent beginning balances for palmer cash flow purposes 
cash flows were adversely affected by a  increase in inventories in  as year end balances increased  net of reserves  from  at the end of for historical synalloy operations plus the  palmer beginning balance to  at the end of substantially all of the increase occurred in the specialty chemicals segment to support higher sales projections  including the additional defoamer business acquired during accounts payable also adversely affected cash flows by  in as there were significant inventory purchases in the fourth quarter of in the metals segment which increased the year end accounts payable balance combined with lower nickel surcharges included in s year end accounts payable balance 
operating cash flows were also unfavorably affected by higher other assets and liabilities  net 
a receivable from the prior owners of palmer was established in december for  which resulted from the final working capital adjustment  uncollected accounts receivable and other items detailed in the spa 
this receivable was settled in january cash flows used in operating activities during and totaled  and  respectively  an improvement in cash flows of  cash flows in were generated from net income totaling  before depreciation and amortization expense of  cash flows were adversely affected by an  increase in inventories in  as year end balances increased  net of reserves  from  at the end of to  at the end of substantially all of the increase occurred in the metals segment to support higher sales projections  a sales mix shift to higher cost special alloy products along with the company deciding to begin stocking select special alloy finished goods products to be responsive to projected customer demands 
accounts receivable increased by  in  net of reserves  as a result of the higher metals segment sales activity during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of  combined with an increased number of days sales outstanding for fabrication sales 
higher priced special alloy inventory purchases made during the fourth quarter of increased the accounts payable balance at the end of by  when compared to the year end balance 
operating cash flows were favorably affected by higher accrued expenses at the end of compared to the end of of  as profit based incentives increased  reflecting higher profits earned and advances from customers prepayments from customers used to purchase raw materials required for piping systems projects increased  in compared to in  the company current assets increased  and current liabilities increased  from the year ended amounts  which caused working capital for to increase by  to  from the total of  the current ratio for the year ended december   decreased to from the year end ratio of on august   the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of palmer  a leading manufacturer of liquid storage solutions and separation equipment for the petroleum  municipal water  wastewater  chemical and food industries 
in recent years  palmer business has been focused on providing fiberglass and steel tanks to the oil industry 
its primary facility in andrews  texas is strategically located in the heart of the permian basin of west texas and also serves other liquid rich shale areas including the anadarko basin  eagle ford shale and the barnett shale 
with approximately employees  palmer generated million in revenues for the trailing twelve months ended july  the company paid approximately  for this acquisition 
the prior shareholders of palmer have the ability to receive additional earn out payments ranging from  to  if the business unit achieves targeted levels of ebitda over a three year period following closing  the company will have the ability to claw back portions of the purchase price over a two year period following closing if ebitda falls below baseline levels 
the company is currently forecasting earn out payments totaling  which was discounted to a present value of  using our incremental borrowing rate of percent 
 of this liability was classified as a current liability since the first payment is expected to be made within the next year 
the various assumptions and projections used in the earn out projections were reviewed at december  with no additional adjustments required 
any future changes to the projected earn out payments as a result of our quarterly review of forecasted ebitda would be reflected as an adjustment to earnings in that period 
the company funded the purchase price through an increase in its existing credit facility and new long term debt in the amount of million 
the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to the company earnings 
the operating results of palmer are included in the metals segment 
the liability for the projected earn out payments represent the only fair value asset or liability that is represented as a level liability 
there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between level  level or level in the years ended december  or december  there have also been no changes in the fair value methodologies used by the company 
the company also used cash during for investing activities to fund capital expenditures of  financing activities during generated  through net borrowings on long term debt and the company paid a dividend on december  which used  the company expects that existing cash balances  cash flows from operations and available borrowings will be sufficient to make debt payments and fund estimated capital expenditures of on june   the company entered into a credit agreement with a regional bank to provide a  line of credit that was to expire on june  this agreement was amended by the bank on august  to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement by one additional year to june  in connection with the palmer acquisition discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  on august   the company modified the credit agreement to increase the limit of the credit facility by  to a maximum of  and extended the maturity date to august  on october   the company modified this agreement to increase the limit by an additional  to a maximum of  this increase will be in effect for one year after which the maximum line of credit will revert back to  on october  none of the other provisions of the credit agreement were changed as a result of this modification 
interest on the credit agreement is calculated using the one month libor as defined in the credit agreement  plus a pre defined spread  based on the company total funded debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to an amount equal to a borrowing base calculation that includes eligible accounts receivable  inventories and other non capital assets 
the credit agreement modification on august  also provided for a ten year term loan in the amount of  that requires equal monthly payments of  plus interest 
in conjunction with the new term loan  to mitigate the variability of the interest rate risk  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract the interest rate swap on august  with its current bank 
the interest rate swap is for an initial notional amount of  with a fixed interest rate of percent  and runs for ten years  expiring on august   which equates to the date of the term loan 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases as monthly principal payments are made 
although the swap is expected to effectively offset variable interest in the borrowing  hedge accounting will not be utilized 
therefore  changes in its fair value are being recorded in current assets or liabilities  as appropriate  with corresponding offsetting entries to other income expense 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the company was required to pledge all of its tangible and intangible properties  including the acquired assets of palmer 
covenants under the credit agreement include maintaining a certain total funded debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement  a minimum tangible net worth  and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio 
the company will also be limited to a maximum amount of capital expenditures per year  which is in line with the company currently projected needs 
at december   the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
results of operations comparison of to consolidated for the fiscal year ending december   the company generated net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  compared to net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  in the prior year 
the company generated net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  in the fourth quarter of  compared to net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  in the fourth quarter of consolidated gross profit increased four percent to  in  compared to  in  and  as a percent of sales  decreased to eleven percent of sales in compared to twelve percent of sales in for the fourth quarter of  consolidated gross profit was  an increase of percent from the fourth quarter of of  consolidated gross profit was eleven percent of sales for the fourth quarter of and twelve percent of sales for same period of the increases in dollars and in percentage of sales were attributable to the specialty chemicals segment as discussed in the specialty chemicals segment comparison of to below 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expense for increased by  to  compared to  for  and was seven percent of sales for both and these costs increased  during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of and decreased to seven percent of sales from nine percent of sales for the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
the dollar increase for both the year and fourth quarter of when compared to the same periods of resulted primarily from higher professional fees  travel and amortization connected with the palmer acquisition  an increase in management performance based incentives  higher sales commissions and increased salaries and wages 
these costs were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense for the chemicals segment 
in addition  the company incurred  one time acquisition costs associated with the palmer acquisition in these costs were  for the fourth quarter of all of these items will be discussed in greater detail in the respective sections below 
comparison of to consolidated for the fiscal year ending december   the company generated net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  compared to net earnings of  or per share  on sales of  in the prior year 
consolidated gross profit increased percent to  in  compared to  in  and  as a percent of sales  increased to twelve percent of sales in compared to eleven percent of sales in the increases in dollars and in percentage of sales were attributable to the metals segment as discussed in the metals segment comparison of to below 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expense for increased by  compared to  and was seven percent of sales for  up from six percent for the dollar increase for when compared to the same periods of resulted primarily from an  increase in bad debt expense for the chemicals segment  an increase in management performance based incentives  the loss of outsourcing reimbursements and higher salaries and wages  employee benefits and contract labor 
all of these items will be discussed in greater detail in the respective sections below 
metals segment the following table summarizes operating results and backlogs for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income year end backlogs piping systems comparison of to metals segment the metals segment sales increased percent for as compared to primarily as a result of the addition of palmer for weeks in plus a percent increase in unit volumes partially offset by an eight percent decrease in average selling prices 
sales for the fourth quarter of totaled  an increase of percent over results 
excluding palmer results  sales for the fourth quarter would have been up six percent over the prior year 
the fourth quarter sales increase resulted from a percent increase in unit volumes partially offset by a seven percent decrease in average selling prices 
gross profit for decreased ten percent to  or nine percent of sales  compared to s year end total of  or twelve percent of sales 
for the fourth quarter of  gross profit was  or ten percent of sales  an increase of twelve percent over the fourth quarter of of  or twelve percent of sales 
the segment experienced operating income of  a decrease of percent  and  down four percent  for the year and fourth quarter of  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for same periods of excluding the effect of palmer on sales  the metals segment experienced a favorable product mix in with higher priced non commodity unit volume increasing percent while commodity unit volume increased four percent 
the favorable product mix also affected the fourth quarter shipments  with non commodity unit volumes increasing percent for the quarter while commodity unit volumes increased two percent 
special alloy product shipments surpassed prior year levels as a result of increased customer projects and distributor restocking 
the improved unit volumes for the year and fourth quarter are also the result of increased market share in north america and strong increases in international sales 
operating income for the entire year and fourth quarter of when compared to the same periods of was impacted by the following four factors a palmer was acquired august  and accordingly  weeks and weeks of their operations were included in the year and fourth quarter of  respectively 
b associated with the acquisition of palmer  an intangible asset of  was recognized  which represents the fair value of the customer base that was acquired by the company 
this intangible asset will be amortized over a year period using an accelerated amortization method 
as a result of this transaction  the year and fourth quarter of includes  of amortization expense 
c declining nickel prices resulted in inventory losses in the year and fourth quarter of of approximately  and  respectively 
for the same periods last year  fluctuating nickel prices produced inventory losses of  and  respectively 
as nickel prices decrease  selling prices are reduced accordingly while material costs reflect the higher priced inventory 
d in the year and fourth quarter of  operating income for the fabrication unit of our metals segment was favorably affected by higher unit selling prices associated with the completion of several large scale lump sum jobs 
the unit realized  and  of additional billings during the year and fourth quarter of  respectively  from these completed jobs 
demand for manufactured pipe remains relatively strong  while the fabrication unit continues to deal with excess capacity in the industry which results in margin compression and impacts our sales and profits 
margins on fabrication projects in the fourth quarter of were the lowest of the entire year 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to this expense category was five percent of sales for both periods 
the increase resulted from the inclusion of palmer expenses for a portion of  the amortization of palmer intangible asset  an additional provision in for the collectability of accounts receivable  increased sales commissions  additional salaries and wages in and higher performance based bonuses for select segment employees 
these higher expense categories were partially offset by increased employee procurement expenses in as additional sales executives were hired for the fabrication product line 
comparison of to metals segment the metals segment sales increased percent for as compared to primarily as a result of a twelve percent increase in average selling prices coupled with a five percent increase in unit volumes 
gross profit for increased percent to  or twelve percent of sales  compared to s year end total of  or nine percent of sales 
the segment experienced operating income of  up percent  for compared to  for the segment experienced a favorable product mix in with higher priced non commodity unit volume increasing percent while commodity unit volume decreased two percent 
special alloy product shipments surpassed prior year levels as a result of increased customer projects and distributor restocking 
the improved unit volumes for the year are also the result of increased market share in north america and strong increases in international sales 
pipe manufacturing operating margins strengthened throughout the year due to the favorable product mix while fabrication margins were under pressure from underutilized capacity in the market 
operating income increased for the segment despite nickel prices falling for most of the year 
as nickel prices decrease  selling prices are reduced accordingly while material costs reflect the higher priced inventory 
although there is no way to precisely calculate the effect of price level changes on profits  the company estimates that for the year the segment experienced a negative effect of  nickel prices rose in the prior year  which resulted in an increase to operating income of  for selling  general and administrative expense increased  or twelve percent in when compared to this expense category was five percent of sales for both periods 
the increase resulted from higher performance based bonuses for select segment employees combined with increased salaries and wages and employee procurement expenses as additional sales executives were hired for the fabrication product line along with wage increases for senior level executives as their responsibilities expanded to include the entire metals segment 
specialty chemicals segment the following tables summarize operating results for the three years indicated 
reference should be made to note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
amounts in thousands amount amount amount net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income comparison of to specialty chemicals segment sales for the specialty chemicals segment increased percent for  ending the year at  compared to  in pounds shipped for the year were percent higher than the prior year 
for the fourth quarter of  sales were  up percent from s fourth quarter sales of  pounds shipped for the fourth quarter were percent higher than the same period of the prior year 
the fourth quarter and annual sales increase resulted mainly from the addition of additional defoamer production for a global chemical manufacturer which began in late may and reached targeted production levels during the third quarter of gross profit for the year was  up percent from the prior year amount of  as a percent of sales  gross profit was percent of sales and gross profit was percent of sales 
the fourth quarter showed gross profit of  or percent of sales  and  or percent of sales  for and  respectively 
gross profit increased for the year and fourth quarter as a result of higher facility utilization associated with the additional defoamer production combined with the ability to pass along raw material price increases to our customers 
operating income for the year increased percent from the prior year 
operating income for was  or nine percent of sales  while recorded  or five percent of sales 
the segment showed operating income of  or eight percent of sales  for the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter of recorded an operating loss of  or one percent of sales 
during december  the segment recorded an  charge to reserve for the potential uncollectable receivable balances for four customers 
the bulk of the charge was for a customer who experienced financial difficulty during the last half of management attempted to develop a long term payment strategy for the customer but was never able to develop a plan suitable to both parties 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased  or five percent in when compared to  and decreased to seven percent of sales in compared to eight percent in for the fourth quarter  selling  general and administrative expense was  in  a decrease of  when compared to the same period of the increase in the reserve for potential uncollectable receivables in december  as explained in the prior paragraph  was partially offset by higher sales commissions in comparison of to specialty chemicals segment sales for the specialty chemicals segment increased one percent for  ending the year at  compared to  in pounds shipped for the year were eleven percent lower than the prior year 
the segment experienced a favorable product mix during  with increased sales of higher priced products combined with a slightly higher selling price as the segment passed along a portion of its raw material cost increases to its customers 
gross profit for was  down percent from the prior year amount of  as a percent of sales  gross profit was percent of sales and gross profit was percent of sales 
the reduction in gross profit for the year resulted from increased raw material costs and the segment desire to maintain increase market share by not passing on all of the increased costs to its customers 
operating income for the year decreased percent from the prior year 
operating income for was  or five percent of sales  while recorded  or nine percent of sales 
during december  the segment recorded an  charge to reserve for the potential uncollectable receivable balances for four customers 
the bulk of the charge was for a customer who experienced financial difficulty during the last half of management attempted to develop a long term payment strategy for the customer but was never able to develop a plan suitable to both parties 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  or percent in when compared to  and increased to eight percent of sales in compared to seven percent in the increase in the reserve for potential uncollectable receivables in december  as explained in the prior paragraph  resulted in the entire increase 
unallocated income and expense reference should be made to note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  for the schedule that includes these items 
comparison of to corporate corporate expenses for were  or two percent of sales  compared to  or two percent of sales for this represents an increase of  or percent 
directly as a result of the acquisition  the company incurred higher corporate costs in for professional fees  travel and non income related taxes and licenses of approximately  the company also incurred  of palmer non recurring acquisition costs during these expenditures include  for professional audit fees associated with due diligence  preparation and audit of historical financial statements and intangible asset identification and valuation   related to bank fees associated with the swap agreement   of legal fees   of travel costs and other various charges of  comparison of to corporate corporate expenses for were  or two percent of sales  compared to  or one percent of sales for this represents an increase of  or percent 
the most significant contributor to the increase was higher performance based bonuses for select corporate employees  which increased  during compared to the company also experienced higher stock option compensation costs and consulting fees  partially offset by lower professional fees 
during the second quarter of  the company relocated its corporate office and the company was no longer able to provide administrative services to the spartanburg manufacturing facility which the company sold in this resulted in the loss of reimbursement for the costs of providing these functions to the buyer of this facility during along with higher office rent expense 
contractual obligations and other commitments as of december   the company contractual obligations and other commitments were as follows amounts in thousands payment obligations for the year ended total thereafter obligations line of credit term loan vehicle loan interest payments contingent consideration operating leases purchase obligations deferred compensation total for a description of the deferred compensation obligation  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
current conditions and outlook the metals segment business is highly dependent on its customers capital expenditures 
we are seeing improvements in this area with many new projects starting and those projects that were previously put on hold are moving again 
the metals segment is experiencing a strong level of inquiries  especially in the chemical and petrochemical areas 
even though excess capacity in the fabrication units continues  we are seeing project quote load improvements for both pipe and fabrication jobs 
profit margins on the new project activity are somewhat better than third and fourth quarter levels 
stainless steel surcharges  which affect our cost of raw materials  declined steadily from march to september in the range of percent 
in the fourth quarter  they were basically steady 
for january and february they have increased somewhat in the range of eight percent 
our inventory gains and losses are determined by a number of factors including sales mix and the holding period of particular products 
as a consequence  there may not be a direct correlation between the direction of stainless steel surcharges and inventory profits or losses at a particular point in time 
our experience has been that over the course of a business cycle  this volatility has tended towards zero 
we believe we are the largest and most capable domestic producer of non commodity stainless steel pipe and an effective producer of commodity stainless steel pipe  which should serve us well in the long run 
our market position remains strong in the commodity pipe market and we are experiencing an upswing in special alloy demand 
we also continue to be optimistic about the fabrication business over the long term 
management anticipates continued strong sales of fiberglass and steel tanks as the oil drilling boom continues in the permian basin and eagle ford shale areas of texas 
during  we will be focusing on gaining production efficiencies at palmer to increase tank production 
the fabrication backlog continues to decline but management is seeing recent stabilization 
the current backlog remains satisfactory for scheduling and production control 
approximately percent of fabrication current backlog comes from paper and wastewater treatment projects and percent is for chemical projects 
total fabrication backlog was  at december  and  at december  specialty chemicals segment sales and profit improvement should continue in as the additional defoamer business has been completely implemented in production and the specialty chemicals segment will reflect a full year of higher production in its results 
management is also pursuing additional sales opportunities for non defoamer products 
operating margins should remain at current levels as management believes they can be successful in passing raw material price increases to the customer 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risks from adverse changes in interest rates 
changes in u

interest rates affect the interest earned on the company cash and cash equivalents as well as interest paid on its indebtedness 
except as described below  the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities used to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
fair value of the company debt obligations  which approximated the recorded value  consisted of at december   under a  revolving line of credit expiring on august  with a variable interest rate of percent 
 under a term loan expiring august  with a variable interest rate of percent 
an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of  which fixes the term loan interest rate at percent 
the fair value of the interest rate swap contract was a liability to the company of at december   under a  revolving line of credit expiring on june  with a variable interest rate of percent
