item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and derivative financial instruments the company has certain financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
at present  the company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on any portion of its financing arrangements with floating rates 
accordingly  based on current debt levels at december   if market interest rates increase one percent  the company s interest expense would increase approximately million annually 
some of the company s subsidiaries operate in foreign countries and their financial results are subject to exchange rate movements 
the company has operations in canada with foreign currency exposure  primarily due to sales made from businesses in canada to customers in the united states 
these sales are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  the company s subsidiary in brazil has loans denominated in us dollars 
in  the company began a systematic program to limit its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates related to certain assets and liabilities of its operations in canada and brazil that are denominated in us dollars 
the net exposure generally ranges from to million 
the foreign currency contracts and arrangements created under this program are not designated as hedged items under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc  derivatives and hedging  and accordingly  the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency arrangements  which have been immaterial  are recorded in the income statement 
the company s foreign currency arrangements are generally three months or less and  as of december   the company had no foreign currency arrangements or contracts in place 
the company uses certain commodities  primarily plastic resins  in its manufacturing processes 
the cost of operations can be affected as the market for these commodities changes 
the company currently has no derivative contracts to hedge this risk  however  the company also has no significant purchase obligations to purchase fixed quantities of such commodities in future periods 
significant future increases in the cost of plastic resin or other adverse changes in the general economic environment could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in the summary of significant accounting policies included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
we believe the following matters may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
bad debts the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  the company also reviews historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 

table of contents inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for approximately percent of the company s inventories and the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized and appropriate variances are evaluated for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill goodwill is subjected to annual impairment testing  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
we conduct our annual impairment assessment as of october we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if we conclude that this is the case  we perform the two step test 
otherwise  we do not perform the test 
goodwill impairment testing requires  in part  that we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which  in turn  requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates for those reporting units 
fair values are established using comparative market multiples in the current market conditions and discounted cash flows 
the discount rates used are based on the weighted average cost of capital determined for each of the company s reporting units and ranged from to in in addition we would make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in determining market multiples in valuing our business units 
we also compare our book value and the estimates of fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of and at dates near the annual testing date 
management uses this comparison as additional evidence of the fair value of the company  as our market capitalization may be suppressed by other factors such as the control premium associated with a controlling shareholder  our leverage or general expectations regarding future operating results and cash flows 
in situations where the implied value of the company under the income or market approach are significantly different than our market capitalization we re evaluate and adjust  if necessary  the assumptions underlying our income and market approach models 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with fasb asc  contingencies asc 
asc requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency were settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency were settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns  at the point of passage of title and risk of loss  which is generally at time of shipment  and collectability of the fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest such earnings for an indefinite period of time 
the company has operations outside the united states and in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than in the united states 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amounts of tax assets  liabilities and expense to be recognized 
fasb asc  income taxes asc requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on all available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the recovery of its deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
also  significant judgment is required in determining the company s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties under asc we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
recent pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income requiring new disclosures regarding reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
asu no 
requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of aoci in its entirety  by component  on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
the company plans to adopt this guidance beginning in the first quarter of 
table of contents in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic which simplifies the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
asu no 
gives the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amounts as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative valuation test 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after september  the company conducted its annual impairment assessment as of october  which included adoption of this guidance 
the adoption of this guidance on october  did not have a significant impact on the company consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the new accounting standard requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
the update eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
on december  the fasb issued a final standard to defer the new requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
effective january   we adopted this asc guidance and have presented net income and other comprehensive income in two consecutive statements
