regulation of prudential savings bank pennsylvania banking law 
the pennsylvania banking code of contains detailed provisions governing the organization  location of offices  rights and responsibilities of directors  officers  employees and members  as well as corporate powers  savings and investment operations and other aspects of prudential savings bank and its affairs 
the banking code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the department so that the supervision and regulation of state chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices 
one of the purposes of the banking code is to provide savings banks with the opportunity to be competitive with each other and with other financial institutions existing under other pennsylvania laws and other state  federal and foreign laws 
a pennsylvania savings bank may locate or change the location of its principal place of business and establish an office anywhere in the commonwealth  with the prior approval of the department 
the department generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years 
although the department may accept the examinations and reports of the fdic in lieu of its own examination  the present practice is for the department to alternate with the fdic 
the department may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director  trustee  officer  attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity  after the department has ordered the activity to be terminated  to show cause at a hearing before the department why such person should not be removed 
insurance of accounts 
the deposits of prudential savings bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the deposit insurance fund and are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
the dodd frank act permanently increased deposit insurance on most accounts to  as insurer  the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of  and to require reporting by  insured institutions 
it also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the fdic 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions 
the fdic s risk based premium system provides for quarterly assessments 
each insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories depending on supervisory and capital considerations 
within its risk category  an institution is assigned to an initial base assessment rate which is then adjusted to determine its final assessment rate based on its brokered deposits  secured liabilities and unsecured debt 
the fdic recently amended its deposit insurance regulations to change the assessment base for insurance from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity and to lower overall assessment rates 
the revised assessments rates are between to basis points for banks in the lowest risk category and between to basis points for banks in the highest risk category 
the amendments were effective for the quarter beginning april  with the new assessment methodology being reflected in the premium invoices that were due september  in  the fdic also required insured deposit institutions on december  to prepay quarters of estimated insurance assessments 
our prepayment totaled approximately million 
this prepayment did not immediately affect prudential saving bank s earnings 
we were required to book the prepaid assessment as a non earning asset and record the actual risk based premium payments at the end of each quarter 
in addition  all institutions with deposits insured by the fdic are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a mixed ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the deposit insurance fund 
these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution  including prudential savings bank  if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the fdic 
it also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance  if the institution has no tangible capital 
if insurance of accounts is terminated  the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination  less subsequent withdrawals  shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years  as determined by the fdic 
management is not aware of any existing circumstances which could result in termination of the bank s deposit insurance 
capital requirements 
the fdic has promulgated regulations and adopted a statement of policy regarding the capital adequacy of state chartered banks which  like prudential savings bank  are not members of the federal reserve system 
these requirements are substantially similar to those adopted by the federal reserve board regarding bank holding companies 
the fdic s capital regulations establish a minimum tier i leverage capital requirement for the most highly rated state chartered  non member banks 
an additional cushion of at least basis points is required for all other state chartered  non member banks  which effectively increases their minimum tier i leverage ratio to or more 
under the fdic s regulation  the most highly rated banks are those that the fdic determines are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and have well diversified risk  including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity  good earnings and  in general  which are considered a strong banking organization and are rated composite under the uniform financial institutions rating system 
leverage or core capital is defined as the sum of common stockholders equity including retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus all intangible assets other than certain qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights 
the fdic also requires that savings banks meet a risk based capital standard 
the risk based capital standard for savings banks requires the maintenance of total capital which is defined as tier i capital and supplementary tier capital to risk weighted assets of 
in determining the amount of risk weighted assets  all assets  plus certain off balance sheet assets  are multiplied by a risk weight of to  based on the risks the fdic believes are inherent in the type of asset or item 
the components of tier i capital are equivalent to those discussed above under the leverage capital standard 
the components of supplementary capital include certain perpetual preferred stock  certain mandatory convertible securities  certain subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock and general allowances for loan and lease losses 
allowance for loan and lease losses includable in supplementary capital is limited to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
overall  the amount of capital counted toward supplementary capital cannot exceed of core capital 
the group of governors and heads of supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee on banking supervision  adopted basel iii in september  which constitutes a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations in the united states and around the world 
in july of the respective us federal banking agencies issued final rules implementing basel iii and the dodd frank act capital requirements to be fully phased in on a global basis on january  the new regulations establish a new tangible common equity capital requirement  increase the minimum requirement for the current tier risk weighted asset rwa ratio  phase out certain kinds of intangibles treated as capital and certain types of instruments and change the risk weightings of certain assets used to determine required capital ratios 
the new common equity tier capital component requires capital of the highest quality predominantly composed of retained earnings and common stock instruments 
for community banks such as prudential savings bank  a common equity tier capital ratio will become effective on january  the new capital rules will also increase the current minimum tier capital ratio from to beginning on january  in addition  institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain greater than in common equity attributable to a capital conservation buffer to be phased in from january  until january  the new rules also increase the risk weights for several categories of assets  including an increase from to for certain acquisition  development and construction loans and more than day past due exposures 
the new capital rules maintain the general structure of the prompt corrective action rules  but incorporate the new common equity tier capital requirement and the increased tier rwa requirement into the prompt corrective action framework 
prudential savings bank is also subject to more stringent department capital guidelines 
although not adopted in regulation form  the department utilizes capital standards requiring a minimum of leverage capital and risk based capital 
the components of leverage and risk based capital are substantially the same as those defined by the fdic 
at september   prudential savings bank s capital ratios exceeded each of its capital requirements 
prompt corrective action 
the following table shows the amount of capital associated with the different capital categories set forth in the prompt corrective action regulations 
total tier tier capital category risk based capital risk based capital leverage capital well capitalized or more or more or more adequately capitalized or more or more or more undercapitalized less than less than less than significantly undercapitalized less than less than less than in addition  an institution is critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 
under specified circumstances  a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category except that the fdic may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized 
an institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements within days of the date that the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
a federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within days after receiving a capital restoration plan  subject to extensions by the agency 
an institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution 
in addition  undercapitalized institutions are subject to various regulatory restrictions  and the appropriate federal banking agency also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions 
at september   prudential savings bank was deemed a well capitalized institution for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations and as such is not subject to the above mentioned restrictions 
the table below sets forth the company and prudential savings bank s capital position relative to its respective regulatory capital requirements at september  required for capital corrective action actual adequacy purposes provisions amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands tier capital to average assets company   n a n a bank tier capital to risk weighted assets company   n a n a bank total capital to risk weighted assets company   n a n a bank activities and investments of insured state chartered banks

an insured state bank is not prohibited from  among other things acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary  investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition  rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project  provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed of the bank s total assets  acquiring up to of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors  trustees and officers liability insurance coverage or bankers blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions  and acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met 
the fdic has adopted regulations pertaining to the other activity restrictions imposed upon insured state banks and their subsidiaries 
pursuant to such regulations  insured state banks engaging in impermissible activities may seek approval from the fdic to continue such activities 
state banks not engaging in such activities but that desire to engage in otherwise impermissible activities either directly or through a subsidiary may apply for approval from the fdic to do so  however  if such bank fails to meet the minimum capital requirements or the activities present a significant risk to the fdic insurance funds  such application will not be approved by the fdic 
pursuant to this authority  the fdic has determined that investments in certain majority owned subsidiaries of insured state banks do not represent a significant risk to the deposit insurance funds 
investments permitted under that authority include real estate activities and securities activities 
restrictions on capital distributions 
under federal rules  an insured depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it is already undercapitalized 
in addition  federal regulators have the authority to restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends for safety and soundness reasons 
the fdic also prohibits an insured depository institution from paying dividends on its capital stock or interest on its capital notes or debentures if such interest is required to be paid only out of net profits or distributing any of its capital assets while it remains in default in the payment of any assessment due the fdic 
prudential savings bank is currently not in default in any assessment payment to the fdic

prudential savings bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes such policy is in compliance with applicable regulations

federal anti money laundering rules impose various requirements on financial institutions to prevent the use of the us financial system to fund terrorist activities 
these provision include a requirement that financial institutions operating in the united states have anti money laundering compliance programs  due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering 
such compliance programs supplement existing compliance requirements  also applicable to financial institutions  under the bank secrecy act and the office of foreign assets control regulations 
prudential savings bank has established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the federal anti money laundering provisions 
regulatory enforcement authority 
applicable banking laws include substantial enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution affiliated parties  as defined

in addition  it has been the policy of the federal reserve board that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the federal reserve board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the federal reserve board regulations  or both 
the dodd frank act included a provision that directs federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries 
non banking activities 
the business activities of prudential bancorp  as bank holding companies  are restricted by the bank holding company act

restrictions on dividends 
prudential bancorp s ability to declare and pay dividends may depend in part on dividends received from prudential savings bank 
the pennsylvania banking code regulates the distribution of dividends by savings banks and states  in part  that dividends may be declared and paid out of accumulated net earnings  provided that the bank continues to meet its surplus requirements 
in addition  dividends may not be declared or paid if prudential savings bank is in default in payment of any assessment due the fdic

limitations on transactions with affiliates 
transactions between insured financial institutions and any affiliate are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
an affiliate of an insured financial institution is any company or entity which controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the insured financial institution 
in a bank holding company context  the bank holding company of an insured financial institution such as prudential bancorp and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the insured financial institution 
generally  section a limits the extent to which the insured financial institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such institution s capital stock and surplus  and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus

taxation federal taxation general 
prudential bancorp and prudential savings bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations with some exceptions listed below 
the following discussion of federal  state and local income taxation is only intended to summarize certain pertinent income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the applicable tax rules 
as of september   the internal revenue service has concluded an audit of the company s tax returns for the year ended september  and no adverse findings were noted 
the federal and state income tax return for taxable years through september  have been closed for purposes of examination by the internal revenue service or the pennsylvania department of revenue 
prudential bancorp files a consolidated federal income tax return with prudential savings bank and its subsidiary  psb delaware  inc accordingly  any cash distributions made by prudential bancorp to its shareholders will be treated as cash dividends and not as a non taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes 
method of accounting 
for federal income tax purposes  prudential bancorp and prudential savings bank report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and file their federal income tax return on a fiscal year basis 
bad debt reserves 
the small business job protection act of eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings associations  effective for taxable years beginning after prior to that time  prudential savings bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make additions to the reserve 
these additions could  within specified formula limits  be deducted in arriving at taxable income 
as a result of the small business job protection act of  savings associations must use the specific charge off method in computing their bad debt deduction beginning with their federal tax return 
in addition  federal legislation required the recapture over a six year period of the excess of tax bad debt reserves at december  over those established as of december  taxable distributions and recapture 
prior to the small business job protection act of  bad debt reserves created prior to january  were subject to recapture into taxable income if prudential savings bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests 
new federal legislation eliminated these savings association related recapture rules 
however  under current law  pre reserves remain subject to recapture should prudential savings bank make certain non dividend distributions or cease to maintain a bank charter 
at september   the total federal pre reserve was approximately million 
the reserve reflects the cumulative effects of federal tax deductions by prudential savings bank for which no federal income tax provisions have been made 
alternative minimum tax

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview at september   we had total assets of million  including million in net loans and million of investment and mortgage backed securities  total deposits of million and total stockholders equity of million 
the company conducts community banking activities by accepting deposits and making loans in our market area 
our lending products primarily consist of residential mortgage loans and to a lesser extent commercial real estate  multi family and construction loans 
the company does provide on occasion commercial business and consumer loans in an effort to maintain strong customer relationships 
despite the current market and economic conditions  the company continues to maintain capital in excess of regulatory requirements 
this management s discussion and analysis section is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of prudential bancorp 
the results of operations of prudential bancorp are primarily dependent on the results of the bank 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies in reviewing and understanding financial information for prudential bancorp  you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our financial statements 
these policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item hereof 
the accounting and financial reporting policies of prudential bancorp conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and to general practices within the banking industry 
accordingly  the financial statements require certain estimates  judgments and assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable  based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability in full of the principal of a loan is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for estimated losses and impairments based upon an evaluation of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate 
loan impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of collateral or estimated net realizable value 
it is the policy of management to provide for losses on unidentified loans in its portfolio in addition to criticized and classified loans 
management monitors its allowance for loan losses at least quarterly and makes adjustments to the allowance through the provision for loan losses as economic conditions and other pertinent factors indicate 
the quarterly review and adjustment of the qualitative factors employed in the allowance methodology and the updating of historic loss experience allow for timely reaction to emerging conditions and trends 
in this context  a series of qualitative factors are used in a methodology as a measurement of how current circumstances are affecting the loan portfolio 
included in these qualitative factors are levels of past due  classified  criticized and non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings and loan modifications  nature and volume of loans  changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collections  charge offs and recoveries and for commercial loans  the level of loans being approved with exceptions to lending policy  experience  ability and depth of management and staff  national and local economic and business conditions  including various market segments  quality of the company s loan review system and degree of board oversight  concentrations of credit and changes in levels of such concentrations  and effect of external factors on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  management has established both specific and general pooled allowances 
values assigned to the qualitative factors and those developed from historic loss experience provide a dynamic basis for the calculation of reserve factors for both pass rated loans general pooled allowance and those criticized and classified loans 
the amount of the specific allowance is determined through a loan by loan analysis of certain large dollar commercial real estate loans 
loans not individually reviewed are evaluated as a group using reserve factor percentages based on historical loss experience and the qualitative factors described above 
in determining the appropriate level of the general pooled allowance  management makes estimates based on internal risk ratings  which take into account such factors as debt service coverage  loan to value ratios and external factors 
estimates are periodically measured against actual loss experience 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including  among others  exposure at default  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses on our commercial  construction and residential loan portfolios and historical loss experience 
all of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change 
while management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance 
in addition  the pennsylvania department of banking and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
the pennsylvania department of banking and the fdic may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely affect earnings in future periods 
investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale 
where quoted prices are available in an active market  securities are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy 
if quoted market prices are not available  then fair values are estimated using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
in certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation  securities are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy  although there were no securities with that classification as of september  or management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
the company determines whether the unrealized losses are temporary in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the evaluation is based upon factors such as the creditworthiness of the issuers guarantors  the underlying collateral  if applicable  and the continuing performance of the securities 
in addition the company also considers the likelihood that the security will be required to be sold by a regulatory agency  our internal intent not to dispose of the security prior to maturity and whether the entire cost basis of the security is expected to be recovered 
in determining whether the cost basis will be recovered  management evaluates other facts and circumstances that may be indicative of an other than temporary impairment condition 
this includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of the type of security  length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  and near term prospects of the issuer 
in addition  certain assets are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis  that is  the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances for example  when there is evidence of impairment 
the company measures impaired loans  fhlb stock and loans or bank properties transferred into real estate owned at fair value on a non recurring basis 
valuation techniques and models utilized for measuring financial assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the company at least quarterly 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with us gaap 
the company records deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws 
if actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized  there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
us gaap prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the company recognizes  when applicable  interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated income statement 
assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management s analysis of tax regulations and interpretations 
significant judgment may be involved in the assessment of the tax position 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereto 
derivative financial instruments  contractual obligations and other off balance sheet arrangements 
derivative financial instruments include futures  forwards  interest rate swaps  option contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in the past and do not currently have any intent to do so in the future 
while we have not used derivative financial instruments  we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and the unused portions of lines of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates and may require additional collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary 
commitments to extend credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by us until the instrument is exercised

the primary reason for the million increase in assets was the million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
the increase in such assets reflected the receipt of million in subscription funds held in escrow at the bank at september  from the second step conversion stock offering  partially offset by a decrease of million in deposits not including the funds held in escrow as a part of the stock offering 
subsequent to september   we returned approximately million in excess subscription funds 
loans receivable increased to million at september  from million at september  this increase was funded by the proceeds from sale of investment securities and mortgage backed securities and cash and cash equivalents on hand 
a majority of the loan growth consisted of the origination of single family residential loans within our immediate market area 
total liabilities increased to million at september  from million at september  the million increase in total liabilities was primarily due to the receipt of funds held in escrow for the stock offering 
excluding the funds held in escrow  total deposits decreased million  primarily due to our determination to let certain higher costing certificates of deposit run off as part of our asset liability management strategy 
the deposit outflows experienced during the year were funded from cash and cash equivalents 
total stockholders equity increased by  to million at september  from million at september  the increase was primarily due to the recognition of million in earnings during the year ended september  as well as an increase of  in our equity associated with the company s stock benefit plans  offset by the decline in the market value of the remaining available for sale securities in the portfolio due to changes in market rates as of september  comparison of operating results for the year ended september  and september  general 
for the year ended september   the company recognized net income of million  as compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended september  the lower level of earnings for the year ended september  was primarily due to the reduced amount of gains on the sale of investment and mortgage backed securities recognized during the periods as compared to the same periods in net interest income 
for the year ended september   net interest income decreased  or to million as compared to million for the same period in fiscal the decrease was due to a million or decrease in interest income partially offset by a million or decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in interest income resulted from a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield earned on interest earning assets to combined with a million or decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets for the year ended september  as compared to fiscal year the decrease in the weighted average yield earned was primarily due to the reinvestment at lower current market rates of the proceeds from called or sold investment and mortgage backed securities as well as to the origination of new loans at lower current market rates of interest 
the decrease in the average balance reflected the use of cash and cash equivalents  including proceeds from the call  maturity or sale of investment and mortgage backed securities  to fund the outflow of higher costing deposits  primarily certificates of deposit  as part of our asset liability management strategy and interest rate risk management 
the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from a basis point decrease to in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  reflecting the continued repricing downward of interest bearing liabilities during the fiscal year combined with a million or decrease in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities  primarily certificates of deposit  during the year ended september   as compared to fiscal year the decline in the weighted average rate paid reflected the continued effect of the low interest rate environment on our cost of funds as deposits re priced downward as well as our continued implementation of our asset liability strategies designed to reduce our use of higher costing certificates of deposit as a funding source 
provision for loan losses 
the company recorded a recovery of loan losses of  during the year ended september   while the company established a provision for loan losses of  for the year ended september  no provisions for loan losses were deemed necessary for fiscal in part due to the recovery of previously charged off loan amounts of million during the year ended september  the company believes that the current provision at september  is sufficient to cover all inherent and known losses associated with the loan portfolio at such date 
at september   the company s non performing assets totaled million or of total assets as compared to million or of total assets at september  non performing assets at september  included million in non performing loans consisting of million of one to four family residential loans  million of single family residential investment properties and million of commercial real estate loans 
non performing assets also included two one to four family residential real estate owned properties with an aggregate carrying value of  the decrease in non performing assets during the year ended september  was primarily due to the sale in january of a group of loans related to a condominium project located in philadelphia in which the bank was the lead lender and held a million investment 
in connection with the closing of the loan sale  the bank and the other loan participants extended a loan to an affiliate of the borrower  the proceeds of which were used to reduce the principal balance due on the project 
the bank s portion of such loan is approximately million 
the new loan was classified as a troubled debt restructuring at the time of origination and is included in the million of non performing assets described above 
the new loan is performing in accordance with its terms 
the bank did not incur any additional losses upon completion of the sale of the loans beyond the  loss already recognized in prior periods 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans and of total non performing loans at september  as compared to million  or of total loans and of total non performing loans at september  non interest income 
non interest income amounted to million for the year ended september  compared to million for the same period in fiscal the primary reason for the higher level of non interest income in the periods related to the recognition of million pre tax in gains on sale of securities sold during the year ended september  non interest expense 
for the year ended september   non interest expense decreased  to million compared to million for fiscal year the decrease for the year ended september  was primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefit expense and real estate owned expense resulting from philadelphia real estate tax abatement refunds expensed in prior periods 
income tax expense 
for the year ended september  we incurred income tax expense of million as compared to million for fiscal year income tax expense for the year ended september  was adversely impacted by the decline in available unrealized capital gains resulting in an increase in the valuation allowance recognized in the and periods related to the deferred tax asset for the capital loss carryforward created in connection with the redemption in kind in of our entire investment in a mutual fund 
the valuation allowance related to the capital loss carryforward was increased during june by  to become fully reserved 
as a result  management believes that on an ongoing basis  the company s effective tax rate will have less volatility and be within a more normalized range 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund operations and meet other obligations on a timely and cost effective basis in various market conditions 
the ability of the company to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure  the ability to liquidate assets and the availability of alternative sources of funds 
to meet the needs of the clients and manage the risk of the company  the company engages in liquidity planning and management 
our primary sources of funds are from deposits  scheduled principal and interest payments on loans  loan prepayments and the maturity of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investments  and other funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments can be greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we also maintain excess funds in short term  interest bearing assets that provide additional liquidity 
at september   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
in addition  our available for sale investment and mortgage backed securities amounted to an aggregate of million at september  we use our liquidity to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  and to meet operating expenses 
at september   we had certificates of deposit maturing within the next months amounting to million 
we anticipate that a significant portion of the maturing certificates of deposit will be redeposited with us unless we determine to lower rates to below competition in order to facilitate the reduction of higher cost deposits during periods when there is excess cash on hand or in order to satisfy our asset liability goals 
there were no deposits as of september  requiring the pledging of collateral 
in addition to cash flows from loan and securities payments and prepayments as well as from sales of available for sale securities  we have significant borrowing capacity available to fund liquidity requirements should the need arise 
our borrowings consist solely of advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh  of which we are a member 
under terms of the collateral agreement with the fhlb  we pledge residential mortgage loans as well as our stock in the fhlb as collateral for such advances 
at september   we had  in outstanding fhlb advances and we had the ability to borrow up to million in additional fhlb advances 
a borrowing line of credit has also been established with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia 
in addition  the bank has the ability to generate brokered certificates of deposit 
we anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet our current commitments
