item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
possible loss of key employees and related compensation cost pressures moody s success depends in part upon recruiting  retaining and motivating highly skilled  experienced financial analysts and other professionals 
competition for skilled individuals in the financial services industry is intense  and moody s ability to attract high quality employees could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries 
investment banks  investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by providing more favorable working conditions or offering significantly more attractive compensation packages than moody s 
moody s also may not be able to identify and hire the appropriate qualified employees in some markets outside the us with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis 
we are highly dependent on the continued services of raymond w 
mcdaniel  jr  our president and chief executive officer  and other senior officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of skilled personnel for any reason  as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss  could have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition 
moody s acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results moody s has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow the company 
such transactions present significant challenges and risks 
the market for acquisition targets and other strategic transactions is highly competitive  especially in light of industry consolidation  which may affect our ability to complete such transactions 
if such transactions are completed  they may not realize the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives  and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions 
for instance  the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated  there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures  the company may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management s focus from other business operations 
the anticipated benefits from an acquisition or other strategic transaction may not be realized fully  or may take longer to realize than expected 
as a result  the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on the business  operating results and financial condition 
the trading price of moody s stock could be affected by third party actions ownership of moody s stock is highly concentrated with a majority of shares held by a few institutional stockholders 
due to this concentrated stockholder base  the trading price of moody s stock could be affected considerably by actions of significant stockholders to increase or decrease their positions in moody s stock 
as a result  the actions of these institutional stockholders could create high stock volatility

critical accounting estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  contingencies  goodwill and intangible assets  pension and other retirement benefits  utbs and stock based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable  fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 
pursuant to the guidance of asu  when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables  the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the company s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under asu the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item  the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company s control 
in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 
moody s k 
table of contents the company determines whether its selling price in a multi element transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately 
in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement  which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately  not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range  or only having a limited sales history  the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables 
the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
however  due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing  possible differences in the company s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation and or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained  the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe 
based on the selling price hierarchy established by asu  when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  the company will establish an esp 
esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives  standalone sales prices of similar products  percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service  and customer segment and geography 
additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend 
the company reviews its determination of vsoe  tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 
in the mis segment  revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued 
revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed  generally one year 
in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities  derivatives  international residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities  issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront 
these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities  which ranged from two to years at december  at december   and  deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service 
in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort  fees are allocated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees 
the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings 
mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available 
the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data 
at december   and  accounts receivable included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
furthermore  for certain annual monitoring services  fees are not invoiced until the end of the monitoring period  however  revenue is accrued ratably over the monitoring period 
in the ma segment  products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance  subscriptions  and professional services 
revenue from subscription based products  such as research and data subscriptions and certain software based credit risk management subscription products  is recognized ratably over the related subscription period  which is principally one year 
revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer 
software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period 
revenue from services rendered within the professional services line of business is generally recognized as the services are performed 
if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service  revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs 
a large portion of annual research and data subscriptions and annual software maintenance are invoiced in the months of november  december and january 
products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either stand alone or together in various combinations 
in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and non software deliverables  revenue is allocated to the non software deliverables and to the software deliverables  as a group  using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition previously described 
if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable  the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe 
in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement  the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element  the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements 
moody s k 
table of contents accounts receivable allowance moody s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue  based on historical experience and current conditions 
such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
additionally  estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
billing adjustments and uncollectible account write offs are charged against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts 
moody s also considers the economic environment of the customers  both from an industry and geographic perspective  in evaluating the need for allowances 
based on its analysis  moody s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances 
this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts 
accordingly  moody s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions 
however  significant changes in any of the above factors  or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company s consolidated results of operations 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this md a  commencing on page is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may  in the future  adjust its associated liabilities 
additionally  for legal defense costs insured by the company s wholly owned insurance entity  the company records liabilities for these items based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and or total projected costs to be incurred to defend a claim over the anticipated duration of a matter 
for claims  litigation and proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries not related to income taxes  where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate 
when the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range of amounts  the minimum amount of the range is accrued unless some higher amount within the range is a better estimate than another amount within the range 
in other instances  because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss  management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant 
as additional information becomes available  the company adjusts its assessments and estimates of such matters accordingly 
in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation  regulatory  governmental investigations and inquiries  enforcement and similar matters and contingencies  particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties  the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters 
the company also cannot predict the impact if any that any such matters may have on how its business is conducted  on its competitive position or on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as the process to resolve any pending matters progresses  management will continue to review the latest information available and assess its ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects  if any  on its operations and financial condition 
however  in light of the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of them  the absence of similar court rulings on the theories of law asserted and uncertainties regarding apportionment of any potential damages  an estimate of the range of possible losses cannot be made at this time 
the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiary insures the company against certain risks including but not limited to deductibles for worker s compensation  employment practices litigation  employee medical claims and terrorism  for which the claims are not material to the company 
in addition  for claim years and  the insurance subsidiary insured the company for defense costs related to professional liability claims 
for matters insured by the company s insurance subsidiary  moody s records liabilities based on the estimated total claims expected to be paid and total projected costs to defend a claim through its anticipated conclusion 
the company determines liabilities based on an assessment of management s best estimate of claims to be paid and legal defense costs as well as actuarially determined estimates 
the cheyne siv and rhinebridge siv matters  more fully discussed in the contingencies section of this md a  are both cases from the claims period  and accordingly the defense cost for these matters are insured by the company s insurance subsidiary 
defense costs for matters not self insured by the company s wholly owned insurance subsidiary are expensed as services are provided 
for income tax matters  the company employs the prescribed methodology of topic of the asc which requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date  assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 
moody s k 
table of contents goodwill and other acquired intangible assets moody s annually evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
historically  this was performed as of november or more frequently if impairment indicators arose in accordance with asc topic in the second quarter of  the company changed the date of its annual assessment of goodwill impairment to july of each year 
this is a change in method of applying an accounting principle which management believes is a preferable alternative  as the new date of the assessment is more closely aligned with the company s annual strategic planning process 
the change in the assessment date does not delay  accelerate or avoid a potential impairment charge 
the company has determined that it is impracticable to objectively determine projected cash flows and related valuation estimates that would have been used as of each july of prior reporting periods without the use of hindsight 
as such  the company has prospectively applied the change in annual goodwill impairment testing date beginning in the second quarter of at july   the company had five primary reporting units one in mis that encompasses all of moody s ratings operations and four reporting units within ma rd a  ers  fstc and copal 
the rd a reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor oriented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process  in depth research on major debt issuers  industry studies  economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools 
the ers reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software and maintenance and related implementation services 
in the first quarter of  a division formerly in the rd a reporting unit which provided various financial modeling services was transferred to the ers reporting unit 
additionally  in the second quarter of  the csi reporting unit  which consisted of all operations relating to csi which was acquired in in november  was integrated into ma s training reporting unit to form the fstc reporting unit 
the new fstc reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training and certification services 
in the fourth quarter of  the company acquired copal which is deemed to be separate reporting unit at december  also  in december  the company acquired b h which is part of the ers reporting unit 
in  the fasb issued an asu which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount before proceeding with a quantitative assessment 
the company has adopted the provisions of this asu as of december  and accordingly  the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a three step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
in the first step  the company assesses various qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount 
if a determination is made that  based on the qualitative factors  an impairment does not exist  the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the aforementioned qualitative assessment results in the company concluding that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount  the fair value of the reporting unit will be determined and compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  the company must perform a third step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 
for the reporting units where the company is consistently able to conclude on impairment using only a qualitative approach  the company s accounting policy is to perform the second step of the aforementioned goodwill impairment assessment at least once every three years 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and appropriate comparable market metrics 
the company bases its fair value estimates on reasonable assumptions 
however  as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  actual future results may differ from these estimates 
in addition  the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 
goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units  and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
other assets and liabilities  including applicable corporate assets  are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 
at july   the company determined  based on actual and forecasted operating results and certain other macroeconomic uncertainties that there were indicators that the fair value of the fstc reporting unit may potentially be less than its carrying amount 
this fact coupled with the aforementioned integration of csi with ma s other training businesses  the transfer of a division from the rd a reporting unit to the ers reporting unit and the acquisition of b h after the november  goodwill impairment analysis date  resulted in the company performing a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment on the rd a  ers and fstc reporting units at july  based on this assessment  the company concluded that the goodwill related to these reporting units was not impaired at july   as the fair value for these reporting units was in excess of their carrying values 
moody s k 
table of contents the company performed a qualitative analysis on its mis and copal reporting units at july  and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying amounts 
the most significant estimates in these qualitative assessments were projected results for each reporting unit and the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the qualitative assessment also considered the impact of various macroeconomic conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit that could impact future cash flows 
in addition to analyzing macroeconomic factors that could potentially impact the cash flows of the reporting units  the company analyzed the growth rates and the wacc for the mis reporting unit  noting that changes in the assumptions from those used for the reporting unit s last quantitative assessment as of november  were favorable to the reporting unit s valuation 
for the copal reporting unit  the company believes its fair value approximates the purchase price due to the proximity of the purchase date to the date of the goodwill impairment assessment and the fact that copal is meeting its financial targets established at the time of the acquisition 
based upon the aforementioned qualitative assessment for mis and copal  the company determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the mis and copal reporting units was less than its carrying amount 
in the fourth quarter of  based on declines in cash flow projections for the fstc reporting unit which reflected slower than anticipated growth in training and certification spending for individuals and global financial institutions  the company determined that there were indicators that the fair value of the fstc reporting unit may potentially be less than its carrying amount 
the decline in projected cash flows for the fstc reporting unit from the july  impairment assessment reflects many individuals and global financial institutions scaling back expenditures for training and certification services amidst current macroeconomic uncertainties in the north america and emea regions 
accordingly  the company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment on this reporting unit as of december  this test resulted in the carrying value of the fstc reporting unit being less than its fair value 
as a result  the company performed step three of the goodwill impairment evaluation and determined the implied fair value of the fstc reporting unit s goodwill by calculating the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
this calculation resulted in the carrying value of the fstc reporting unit s goodwill exceeding its fair value resulting in an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of sensitivity analyses and key assumptions for deriving the fair value of a reporting unit the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december  as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic  assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for all reporting units 
for the rd a and ers reporting units  the fair value in the table below was calculated as of july  as described above  there was a quantitative assessment performed on the fstc reporting unit as of december  and accordingly  the fair value in the table below for this reporting unit was calculated as of december   for the mis reporting unit  the fair value was calculated as of november  as there have been no qualitative indicators that have resulted in the company performing a quantitative test subsequent to this date 
the copal reporting unit s fair value is deemed to be its purchase price 
sensitivity analysis deficit caused by a hypothetical reduction to fair value goodwill mis rd a ers fstc copal total copal was excluded from the sensitivity analysis in the table above as well as the sensitivity analyses on the wacc and future cash flow assumptions discussed below as it was acquired in the fourth quarter of accordingly  the carrying value of the net assets acquired approximates their fair value at december  as can be seen from the table above  the reporting unit most at risk for potential impairment is the fstc reporting unit  and failure to meet its financial projections could result in further goodwill impairment 
this business is  in part  sensitive to the staffing levels and profitability of the global financial services industry  particularly in canada and emea 
the following is a discussion regarding the company s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units as of the date of each reporting unit s last quantitative test december  for fstc  july  for rd a and ers  november  for mis 
this discussion excludes copal which has not yet been subject to a full quantitative impairment analysis as of december  due to the timing of the acquisition of this entity 
moody s k 
table of contents the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples 
the dcf analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair value  including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit  which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans  expected long term growth rates  terminal values  weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
moody s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition 
the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis  or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 
the sensitivity analyses on the wacc and future cash flow assumptions described below are as of the date of the last quantitative assessment for each reporting unit 
the fstc reporting unit is excluded from these sensitivity analyses as there was a goodwill impairment charge recorded for this reporting unit in the fourth quarter of the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment wacc the wacc is the rate used to discount each reporting unit s estimated future cash flows 
the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity 
the cost of equity is based on a risk free interest rate  an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit s cash flows 
the cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the company s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc 
the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested 
the wacc for all reporting units ranged from to as of the date of the last quantitative test for each reporting unit 
differences in the wacc used between reporting units is due primarily to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units 
a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on the mis  rd a and ers reporting units as of the last date that a quantitative annual goodwill impairment analysis was performed 
an increase in the wacc of one percentage point would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting units exceeding their respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic future cash flow assumptions the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit 
these projections are consistent with the company s operating and strategic plan 
cash flows for the five years subsequent to the date of the last quantitative goodwill impairment analysis were estimated based on annual revenue growth rates ranging from to percent 
the growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue from financial service customers based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets which began in the second half of beyond five years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates 
a sensitivity analysis of the growth rates was performed on the mis  rd a and ers reporting units 
a decrease in the growth rates used in the discounted cash flow calculation of for these reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in conjunction with the assessment of goodwill impairment at july   the company reviewed the recoverability of certain customer lists within its fstc reporting unit 
this review resulted in an impairment of approximately million in the third quarter of which is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company again reviewed the recoverability of these customer lists in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the quantitative goodwill impairment test performed at december  based on this assessment  there was no further impairment of the customer lists in the fourth quarter of for all other intangible assets  there were no such events or changes during that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the company s reporting units may not be recoverable 
this determination was made based on improving market conditions for the reporting unit where the intangible asset resides and an assessment of projected cash flows for all reporting units 
additionally  there were no events or circumstances during that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of these amortizable intangible assets 
pension and other retirement benefits the expenses  assets and liabilities that moody s reports for its retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances 
these assumptions include the following future compensation increases  based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets  based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments future healthcare cost trends  based on historical market data  near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends moody s k 
table of contents discount rates  based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligation for its retirement plans as of december  were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve 
the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 
moody s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses  assets and liabilities related to the company s retirement plans 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise 
excluding differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets  the company amortizes  as a component of annual pension expense  total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain loss exceeds of the greater of the beginning of year projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets 
for moody s retirement plans  the total losses as of december  that have not been recognized in annual expense are million  and moody s expects to recognize a net periodic benefit expense of million in related to the amortization of actuarial losses 
for moody s funded us pension plan  the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense 
as permitted under asc topic  the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization 
as of december   the company has an unrecognized asset gain of million  of which million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of expense 
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody s operating income 
these effects have been calculated using the company s current projections of expenses  assets and liabilities related to moody s retirement plans  which could change as updated data becomes available 
assumption used for estimated impact on operating income decrease increase weighted average discount rates weighted average assumed compensation growth rate assumed long term rate of return on pension assets weighted average discount rates of and for pension plans and other retirement plans  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect projected expenses 
based on current projections  the company estimates that expenses related to retirement plans will be million in compared with million in the expected expense increase in reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to lower discount rate assumptions  lower expected return on plan assets due to lower long term rate of return assumption  and higher amortization of actuarial losses 
stock based compensation the company records compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options and restricted stock 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
some of the assumptions and estimates  such as share price volatility and expected option holding period  are based in part on moody s experience during the period since becoming a public company 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense

the company s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for services provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic therefore  income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes  and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 
the company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters 
the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps 
the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties  if any  as part of other non operating expenses 
for utps  asc topic requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date  assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 
as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company  there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits  and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company s operating results or financial condition 
for certain of its non us subsidiaries  the company has deemed the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations 
accordingly  the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of deferred taxes that might be required to be provided if such earnings were distributed in the future due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made 
other estimates in addition  there are other accounting estimates within moody s consolidated financial statements  including recoverability of deferred tax assets  anticipated dividend distributions from non us subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated results of operations or financial condition

the mis segment is comprised of all of the company s ratings activities 
all of moody s other non rating commercial activities are included in the ma segment 
the mis segment consists of four lines of business corporate finance  structured finance  financial institutions and public  project and infrastructure finance that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide

the discussion also includes intersegment fees charged to mis from ma for the use of certain ma products and services in mis s ratings process 
these fees charged by ma are generally equal to the costs incurred by ma to provide these products and services 
overhead charges and corporate expenses which exclusively benefit one segment are fully charged to that segment 
additionally  overhead costs and corporate expenses of the company which benefit both segments are generally allocated to each segment based on a revenue split methodology 
overhead expenses include costs such as rent and occupancy  information technology and support staff such as finance  human resources and information technology 
beginning on january   the company refined its methodology for allocating certain overhead departments to its segments to better align the costs allocated based on each segment s usage of the overhead service
