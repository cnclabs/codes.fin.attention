overview sciclone pharmaceuticals nasdaq scln is a revenue generating  profitable  united states us based  china focused  specialty pharmaceutical company with a substantial commercial business and a product portfolio of therapies for oncology  infectious diseases  cardiovascular  urological  respiratory and central nervous system disorders 
we are focused on continuing to grow our revenue and profitability through our strong sales and marketing efforts 
our business and corporate strategy is focused primarily on the people s republic of china china where we have built a solid reputation and established a strong brand through many years of experience marketing our lead product  zadaxin thymalfasin 
in addition  we have an established product promotion business model with large pharmaceutical partners and we are focused on establishing profitability in all of these collaborations 
we believe our sales and marketing strengths position us to benefit from the long term expansion of the pharmaceutical market in china 
this pharmaceutical market currently ranks third among the global pharmaceutical markets  and we believe china will rank second among global pharmaceutical markets by we seek to expand our presence in china and increase revenues by growing sales and profitability of our current product portfolio  launching new products from our development pipeline  adding new  profitable product services agreements and leveraging our strong cash position to in license additional products 
we operate in two segments which are generally based on the nature and location of our customers china and the rest of the world which includes our us and hong kong operations 
we have two categories of revenues product sales revenues and promotion services revenues 
our product sales revenues result from our proprietary and in licensed products  including our lead product  zadaxin  and products from pfizer inc pfizer and iroko pharmaceuticals llc 
zadaxin has the highest margins in our portfolio as it is a premium proprietary product sold exclusively by sciclone 
aggrastat  an in licensed product  has higher margins than the products we promote under services agreements and we anticipate revenues from this product will grow significantly as it further penetrates the china market 
in addition  we anticipate that new marketed products  when and if introduced  can increase the future revenues and profitability of our pharmaceutical business in china over the coming years 
our promotion services revenues result from fees we receive for exclusively promoting products under services agreements with certain pharmaceutical partners  including sanofi aventis sa sanofi and baxter international  inc baxter in china 
we refer to these agreements as promotion agreements  service agreements and distribution contract rights agreements 
we recognize promotion services revenues as a percentage of our collaborators product sales revenue for these exclusively promoted products  such as depakine  stilnox and tritace 
over time  as additional proprietary or in licensed products come to the market  we aim to shift our product mix towards those higher margin products 
in january  our promotion agreement with sanofi was renewed until december  under the same terms as our previous agreement 
as we seek renewals of our product services agreements  our strategy is to establish more favorable terms with the goal of achieving profitability under these agreements through improved margins as well as through managing expenses relating to our product services revenue 
zadaxin is approved in over countries and may be used for the treatment of hbv  hcv  and certain cancers  and as a vaccine adjuvant according to the local regulatory approvals we have in these countries 
in china  thymalfasin is included in the treatment guidelines issued by the ministry of health moh for liver cancer  as well as guidelines for treatment of chronic hbv issued by both the chinese medical association and the asian pacific association for the study of the liver and invasive fungal infections of critically ill patients 
table of contents issued by the chinese medical association 
our sales force is focused on increasing sales to the country s largest hospitals class with over beds as well as mid size hospitals class 
these hospitals serve tier and tier cities located mostly in the eastern part of china which are the largest and generally have the most affluent populations 
we are widening our market strategies by targeting numerous smaller hospitals as well as hospitals that are in more rural areas 
we are also seeking to expand the indications for which zadaxin could be used  including sepsis 
our market portfolio also includes the anti epileptic drug depakine  the hypnotic stilnox marketed as ambien in the us  the ace inhibitor tritace  and aggrastat  an intervention cardiology product launched in china in we are also pursuing the registration of several other therapeutic products in china 
these include dc bead  an embolic acting bead with drug loading capabilities that can be used for targeted delivery of cancer chemotherapy drugs directly to the tumor  loramyc  a mucoadhesive tablet formulation of miconazole lauriad to treat oropharyngeal candidiasis  rapinyl  a sublingual tablet formulation of fentanyl to treat breakthrough cancer pain  and rapidfilm  an oral film formulation of ondansetron to treat nausea induced by chemotherapy 
we continue to seek to establish profitable in licensing arrangements for approved or late stage branded  well differentiated products which if not yet approved  have a clear regulatory approval pathway in china based on existing regulatory approval outside of china 
our objective is to in license products with higher margins that can augment our product sales revenue  and we continue to explore opportunities to optimize our promotion services revenues 
we are also working on the final stage of the regulatory approval in china for our in licensed candidate dc bead  and on the approval process for our other product candidates  all of which are in clinical trials or in other stages of the regulatory approval process in china 
we acquired novamed pharmaceuticals  inc novamed on april  and our results of operations include the operations of novamed as of that date forward 
since the acquisition of novamed  we have put strategies in place designed to strengthen our sales and marketing infrastructure in china  with the goal of meeting the growing demand for pharmaceuticals in the china market 
however  we believe that several developments in had  or may yet have  material impacts on the growth rate of our business in china and affected the company s financial results in the second half of we are responding to these developments by taking actions to strengthen our business and improve our financial performance in subsequent quarters 
these developments include  but are not limited to a reduction in the retail price for zadaxin and other products that occurred later in the year than expected  an increase in the channel inventory levels of zadaxin during the third quarter and particularly in september of  matters relating to our novamed acquisition  including a non cash impairment loss to fully write down the value of the licensing and product services agreement intangible assets recorded as part of the novamed acquisition  a remeasurement of the valuation of the contingent consideration expense recorded as part of the novamed acquisition  issues in internal control over financial reporting primarily within the novamed subsidiary  and changes in management 
price reduction for zadaxin and other products zadaxin s national reimbursement retail list price in china was recently reviewed by regulatory authorities consistent with the china government s review of pharmaceutical prices once a product has been included into the reimbursement drug list rdl 
as a result of this review  the retail list price or the price at the hospital pharmacy level of zadaxin was reduced by approximately 
the reduction was announced in september and became effective october  based on an agreement with our primary importer of zadaxin into china  this importer will take a larger share of the price reduction impact in exchange for certain exclusive importation rights into china 
as a result  the actual impact on sciclone s revenue and margins is expected to be less than a decrease in our sales price of zadaxin to this importer 
in addition  the national development and reform commission s ndrc retail list prices or the price at the hospital pharmacy level  for aggrastat  as well as for several of our oncology products exclusively promoted in china for pfizer and baxter  were reduced ranging from to 

table of contents zadaxin inventory and sales china uses a tiered system to import and distribute products 
the distributors make the sales in the country  but the product is imported for them by our exclusive zadaxin importer 
our product sales revenues result from the sale of our products to our customers  the importing agent 
it takes approximately seven weeks for our customers to clear a shipment of zadaxin through the importation process for sale in china 
our china importation customer tends to purchase infrequent large orders of zadaxin inventory to facilitate the distribution and sale to chinese hospital pharmacies 
the timing of infrequent large orders may significantly affect the zadaxin channel inventory levels and may cause fluctuations to our reported sales and profitability for each quarterly period 
during the third quarter and particularly in september  we estimate that there was an increase of approximately million in zadaxin channel inventory levels and we believe that our sales to our customers exceeded the pace at which our customers were able to sell zadaxin through to other parties  primarily hospital pharmacies 
zadaxin channel inventory levels decreased by approximately million in the fourth quarter of  and we expect them to continue to decrease over the next two quarters 
as a result  we expect that zadaxin revenues will be lower in the first half of  compared to the first half of we expect our sales revenue to be lower than or comparable to our revenues of million 
we continue to believe that we will grow demand for zadaxin through increased penetration in the market 
in addition  we believe that our sales organization s efforts relative to zadaxin may have been affected by changes to and turnover in management in china  particularly the departures of senior executives 
turnover among sales personnel in the china market generally  including among our own sales staff  is expected to continue  and we may experience additional departures in our china operations 
during this transition period  if we are unable to achieve objectives for increased demand  we may experience declines in our quarterly sales revenue in the near term and our sales and profitability for the next few quarters may significantly decrease 
we have taken definitive steps to address the issues affecting product sales 
we have revised and we are implementing changes in our strategy designed to increase market penetration and growth  particularly for zadaxin 
we are widening our market strategies by targeting numerous smaller hospitals as well as hospitals that are in more rural areas with the intent to positively affect sales growth over the next several quarters 
in addition  we have already been successful in making significant changes in our china organization with the recruitment of additional senior level management and the recent appointment of a chief executive officer for our china operations  and we are aggressively recruiting additional management for our china operations 
our recent and continuing executive recruiting in china is intended to bring in additional pharmaceutical company experience in the china market to grow zadaxin sales  to increase profitability  to enhance our financial capabilities and internal controls  and to improve and implement our sales strategies 
novamed intangible asset impairment  contingent consideration remeasurement we acquired novamed on april   and our results of operations include the operations of novamed as of that date forward 
the acquisition increased our portfolio of commercial and development stage products through exclusive licensing and product service agreements with a number of leading pharmaceutical companies 
although revenues from the novamed business have grown since the acquisition  overall revenue growth and profitability have not met the expectations we forecast at the time of the acquisition 
this condition was considered to be an impairment indicator with respect to the intangible assets related to our promotion and distribution contract rights 
during the third quarter ended september   we determined that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the intangible assets were less than the carrying amounts 
we further performed a discounted cash flow analysis related to the intangible assets and determined that a full impairment should be recorded 
as a result  we recognized a non cash impairment loss of approximately million for the third quarter and full year ended december  on our consolidated statements of operations 
in january  our promotion agreement with sanofi was renewed until december  under the same terms as the prior agreement 
certain of our other product services agreements with third parties will be 
table of contents expiring soon unless renewed  extended or renegotiated 
we are actively negotiating renewals or extensions of these agreements 
we are also assessing the terms and conditions of our agreements with the intent to secure more favorable terms to us relative to profitability 
if any of these agreements are determined to no longer be beneficial to us and are allowed to expire  or if third parties will not renegotiate  renew or extend the agreements on terms acceptable to us  our revenues and profitability would be affected 
the terms of our acquisition of novamed provided for the payment of an additional million in earn out payments upon the successful achievement of revenue and earnings targets for the and fiscal years the earn out or contingent consideration 
we initially recorded million as the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration 
the fair value of the contingent consideration was remeasured each quarter and changes to the fair value were recorded to contingent consideration expense or gain 
as of december   we determined the fair value of the contingent consideration was  resulting in a non cash gain of million for the year ended december  the significant reduction in the valuation of the contingent consideration expense during the year was related to revenue and ebitda earnings before interest  depreciation and taxes targets not being achieved and to the reduced probability of renewal relating to novamed s product distribution agreements  including  in particular  the target of renewing the depakine services agreement with sanofi for a five year term 
the depakine services agreement was extended through december   a term less than five years 
restatement of financial results we have revised our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and certain quarterly periods in and accordingly  the revised financial information included in this form k has been identified as restated 
concurrent with the filing of this form k  we are also filing amended quarterly reports on form q a for each of the first  second and third quarters of to restate our consolidated financial statements therein  and the effects of such restatements are reflected in the items revised herein 
the restatements relate to accounting errors originating with our subsidiary in china  novamed  which was acquired on april  the accounting errors relate primarily to the following the timing of revenue recognition for certain pfizer products sold by one of our distributors of our subsidiary novamed 
our policy is that all customers obligations to pay for product are final once product is delivered 
however  we have determined that there were various factors  including the override of certain controls  indicating that sales under novamed s distribution arrangement for pfizer products with such distributor from the date of acquisition of novamed through the third quarter of the relevant periods allowed for contingent payment terms dependent upon when that distributor sold the products 
as a result of our review and evaluation of the matter  we believe that instead of recording revenue at the time of sale to that distributor sell in method  as previously reflected in the financial statements for the relevant periods  revenue under the arrangements in effect at our subsidiary novamed should have been recognized when we received payment for the products sell through or cash receipts method 
effective as of the fourth quarter of  we entered into a new agreement with that distributor which clarified the sell in method of revenue recognition to provide consistency with our policy regarding revenue recognition on a prospective basis 
as of december   we had received payment for all revenues recognized under the sell through method 
the recognition of previously unrecognized product return reserves for sales of aggrastat sold by our subsidiary novamed prior to the date of acquisition 
we have concluded a liability for expired product existed at the time of the novamed acquisition  related to pre acquisition sales 
the revisions had the impact of increasing our revenues by million for the nine months ended september   and increasing our net income by million for the same period 
basic and diluted 
table of contents earnings per share increased by and  respectively  for the nine months ended september  as of september   accounts receivable decreased by million  inventory increased by million and goodwill related to the acquisition of novamed increased by million 
the revisions for the year ended december  had an impact of decreasing our revenues by million and decreasing our net income by million 
basic and diluted earnings per share decreased by 
as of december   accounts receivable decreased by million  inventory increased by million and goodwill related to the acquisition of novamed increased by million 
internal control issues material weakness during the quarter ended september   we identified deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of controls primarily associated with product return reserves related to our aggrastat product line  and the override of certain controls in the financial statement close process related to our novamed subsidiary 
certain out of period adjustments and these deficiencies were identified through the performance of controls and processes recently implemented at our novamed subsidiary as part of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting in we concluded that the aggregation of these deficiencies is a material weakness 
furthermore  during the fourth quarter of  we identified deficiencies related to the timing of revenue recognition for our pfizer products  the override of related controls at our novamed subsidiary  and the corporate monitoring thereof 
we concluded that these deficiencies identified in the fourth quarter of are an additional indicator of the material weakness that was identified in the third quarter of with the oversight of management and our audit committee  we have initiated steps to address the material weakness 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented additional controls related to our revenue recognition and product return reserve processes to strengthen our controls and provide that all available information is properly considered 
we also re evaluated the operation of our controls at our novamed subsidiary and made adjustments to strengthen these controls  including the recent hiring of our chief financial officer  china operations who joined the company in the third quarter of we terminated personnel who were involved in the override of certain controls in the financial statement close process at our novamed subsidiary that resulted in the material weakness 
while we have completed certain remediation efforts  our remediation activities are not complete as of december  china management turnover we announced departures of key personnel from our china organization 
these include the individual who was our chief executive officer of sciclone s china operations and former chief executive officer of novamed who resigned in december  and our chief operating officer in china who left the company in october there may be additional departures within our china operations 
we have and are continuing to recruit executives to address the departures and to expand and strengthen our china operations  including the hiring of both a new chief executive officer  china operations who will begin april   and a chief financial officer  china operations who began august other matters we were developing scv in a phase b clinical trial for the prevention of oral mucositis om 
on march   we announced the discontinuation of this trial based on the pre planned interim analysis results that indicated the trial would not meet the pre specified efficacy endpoints  and our intention to further curtail our us based development efforts 
in march  we implemented a reduction in our workforce of full time employees  primarily in research and development  and recorded severance related charges of approximately million  of which approximately million and million were recognized to general and administrative and research and development expense  respectively  for the year ended december  we have substantially completed the restructuring 

table of contents the us securities and exchange commission sec and the us department of justice doj are each conducting formal investigations of sciclone regarding a range of matters  including the possibility of violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa 
we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec and doj in the conduct of their investigations 
in response to these matters  our board appointed a special committee of independent directors the special committee to oversee our response to the government inquiry 
the special committee substantially concluded its original investigation  and on may and  reported its findings and recommendations to the board of directors 
the special committee has also reported findings to the sec and doj 
in our form q for the period ended september   filed with the sec on november   we disclosed  among other things  a non cash impairment loss to fully write down the value of intangible assets recorded as part of the novamed acquisition  a remeasurement of the valuation of the contingent consideration expense recorded as part of the novamed acquisition  a significant increase in zadaxin channel inventory levels  and internal control issues primarily within the novamed organization that was concluded to represent a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 
following our disclosure of these items  we received a subpoena from the sec requesting documents related to these and various other matters regarding the novamed acquisition and our operations in china 
after review of the subpoena  and in order to respond to inquiries from the doj and sec and to determine if any wrong doing occurred  our audit committee determined to undertake an additional independent investigation as to additional matters including  but not limited to  matters related to our acquisition of novamed and fcpa matters 
we are unable to predict what consequences any investigation by any regulatory agency or by our special committee may have on us 
our cooperation with these investigations has resulted in substantial legal and accounting expenses  has diverted management s attention from other business concerns and could harm our business 
the ongoing investigations and any other regulatory investigations that might be initiated in the future will result in similar substantial expenses  management diversion and harm to our business 
if we fail to comply with regulations or to carry out controls on our chinese or other foreign operations in a manner that satisfies all applicable laws  our business would be harmed 
any civil or criminal action commenced against us by a regulatory agency could result in administrative orders against us  the imposition of significant penalties and or fines against us and or the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions against certain of our officers  directors and or employees 
the investigations  results of the investigations  or remedial actions we have taken or may take as a result of such investigations may adversely affect our business in china 
if we are subject to adverse findings resulting from the sec and doj investigations  or from our own independent investigation  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us 
in addition  we will incur additional expenses related to remedial measures we are undertaking  and could incur fines or other penalties 
the period of time necessary to resolve the investigations by the doj and the sec is uncertain  and these matters could require significant management and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business 
we cannot predict what the outcome of those investigations will be  or the timing of any resolution 
on february   we announced that our reported financial results for each of the second and third quarters of  the year ended december   and the first three quarters of fiscal could not be relied upon and that we would restate them 
subsequently  we received a purported derivative litigation naming certain of our officers and directors as defendants 
we believe the claims lack merit and will vigorously defend against them
