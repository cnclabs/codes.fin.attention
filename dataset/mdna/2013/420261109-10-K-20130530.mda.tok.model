item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of bulk and specialty chemicals to our customers in a wide variety of industries 
we began our operations primarily as a distributor of bulk chemicals with a strong customer focus 
over the years we have maintained the strong customer focus and have expanded our business by increasing our sales of value added specialty chemical products  including repackaging  blending and manufacturing certain products 
in recent years  we have expanded the sales of our higher margin blended and manufactured products 
we have continued to invest in growing our business 
during fiscal  we purchased a acre parcel of land in rosemount  minnesota and began construction of a new facility on the site 
this industrial manufacturing facility became operational in late fiscal the site provides capacity for future business growth and lessens our dependence on our flood prone sites on the mississippi river 
while we have transferred some blending and manufacturing activity to the rosemount site  we do not intend to close any sites we currently operate as a result of this transfer of activity 
in fiscal  we incurred incremental costs related to this new facility of approximately million  and anticipate additional incremental costs of approximately million to operate this facility for the entire year in fiscal in april  we moved into a new corporate headquarters located in roseville  minnesota 
the move was necessary because we had outgrown our former corporate headquarters that had been our home for over years 
as a result of this move  we expect to incur incremental costs of approximately million to lease and operate this facility starting in fiscal we recorded a pre tax charge of million in our industrial segment approximately million after tax  or per share  fully diluted in the third quarter of fiscal this charge represented the discounted value of our estimated withdrawal payment obligation from the central states  southeast and southwest areas pension fund css or the plan  a collectively bargained multiemployer pension plan 
our participation in the plan was pursuant to two collective bargaining agreements that were modified during the fourth quarter of fiscal to discontinue our participation in css 
as a replacement for css  we have agreed to provide defined contribution retirement benefits to our union employees that are similar to those benefits currently offered to our non union employees 
we estimate the aggregate cash payments to be made to total approximately million  or  per year beginning some time in fiscal and continuing annually for twenty years 
we have accrued the discounted value of that payment obligation in the pension withdrawal line item on the consolidated statements of income for fiscal 
table of contents the ultimate amount of the withdrawal liability assessed by css could be impacted by a number of factors  including  among other things  a mass withdrawal generally a withdrawal of substantially all contributing employers  the number of work weeks reported to css by us  the hourly contribution rate paid by us  the continued participation of other employers in css  financial difficulty of other participating employers in the plan including bankruptcy  investment returns  benefit levels  and interest rates 
any assessment in excess of our accrual could impact our future results of operations and financial condition 
in fiscal  we entered into a settlement agreement with icl performance products lp icl  a chemical supplier to us  pursuant to which we mutually resolved the previously disclosed litigation and all disputes among us 
the settlement agreement provided for a cash payment by us to icl and provided that both parties enter into new contracts for the supply by icl of certain chemicals to us 
our obligations under the settlement agreement resulted in a million charge to pre tax income recorded in cost of sales approximately million after tax or per share  fully diluted in the first quarter of fiscal of the total charge  million was paid in fiscal we anticipate that in fiscal we will be vacating our leased facility currently used to produce our bulk pharmaceutical products 
we will transfer production of certain of these products to our other industrial production facilities and discontinue production of the remaining product lines 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million in our industrial segment approximately million after tax related to accelerated depreciation on leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment related to this facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect to incur pre tax charges of to million during the first half of fiscal related to additional depreciation expense and other costs associated with exiting this facility 
in fiscal  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of vertex for approximately million 
in addition to the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite bleaches  vertex distributes and provides terminal services for bulk liquid inorganic chemicals  and contract and private label packaging for household chemicals 
we believe the acquisition strengthens our market position in the midwest 
operating results of vertex are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition in this annual report on form k as part of our industrial segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
we opened one new branch for our water treatment group in fiscal  one in fiscal  and two in fiscal  and expect to continue to invest in existing and new branches to expand our water treatment group geographic coverage 
the cost of these branch expansions is not expected to be material 
in addition  we have selectively added route sales personnel to certain existing water treatment group branch offices to spur growth within our existing geographic coverage area 
our financial performance in fiscal was highlighted by sales from continuing operations of million  a increase from fiscal  gross profit from continuing operations of million  or of sales  an million decrease in gross profit dollars from fiscal  which was negatively impacted by non recurring charges of million related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan and million related to a litigation settlement  net cash provided by operating activities of million  and cash and cash equivalents and investments available for sale of million as of the end of fiscal we seek to maintain relatively constant gross profit dollars per unit sold on each of our products as the cost of our raw materials increase or decrease 
since we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in our raw material costs and resulting prices in the future  we believe that gross profit dollars is the best measure of our profitability from the sale of our products 
if we maintain relatively stable gross profit dollars on each of our products  our reported gross profit percentage will decrease when the cost of the product increases and will increase when the cost of the product decreases 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of valuing the vast majority of our inventory  which causes the most recent product costs to be recognized in our income statement 
the valuation of lifo inventory for interim periods is based on our estimates of fiscal year end inventory levels and costs 
the lifo inventory valuation method and the resulting cost of sales are consistent with our business practices of pricing to current bulk chemical raw material prices 
our lifo reserve decreased by million in fiscal primarily due to reduced volumes of certain bulk products in inventory at year end  resulting in an increase to our reported gross profit for the year 
in fiscal  our lifo reserve increased by million due to the higher volumes and the mix of bulk chemicals in inventory at the end of the year 
this increase in the reserve reduced our reported gross profit in fiscal 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statement of income as a percentage of sales from period to period fiscal fiscal fiscal sales cost of sales pension withdrawal gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income investment income income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to sales of million for fiscal the increase in sales was primarily due to increased sales in our water treatment segment driven by favorable weather conditions during the first half of fiscal and volume growth of lower priced bulk products in both of our segments  partially offset by lower sales of other products in our industrial segment 
sales of bulk chemicals  including caustic soda  were approximately of sales compared to approximately in the previous year 
industrial segment 
industrial segment sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal while overall volumes increased year over year  competitive pricing pressure resulted in lower overall per unit selling prices 
water treatment segment 
water treatment segment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal the increase in sales was primarily due to volume growth resulting from favorable weather conditions in the first half of fiscal and additional sales of bulk products 
gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal fiscal gross profit was negatively impacted by the million css pension withdrawal and the million charge resulting from the litigation settlement  which charges together constituted of sales for the fiscal year 
additionally  gross profit was negatively impacted by million of incremental costs related to the new rosemount facility  and million of accelerated depreciation charges related to a facility we intend to vacate in fiscal the lifo method of valuing inventory increased gross profit by million for fiscal primarily due to reduced volumes of certain bulk products in inventory at year end 
in the prior year  lifo reduced gross profit by million due to higher volumes and the mix of bulk chemicals in inventory at the end of the year 
industrial segment 
gross profit for the industrial segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal fiscal gross profit for this segment was negatively impacted by the million css pension withdrawal charge and the million charge resulting from the litigation settlement  which charges together constituted of industrial segment sales for the fiscal year 
gross profit for this segment was also negatively impacted by heightened competitive pricing pressure  resulting in overall lower per unit margins  million in incremental costs for the new rosemount facility  and by million of accelerated depreciation charges related to the facility we intend to vacate as noted 
table of contents above 
the lifo method of valuing inventory increased gross profit by million in fiscal and reduced gross profit by million in fiscal water treatment segment 
gross profit for the water treatment segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to increased volumes resulting from favorable weather conditions during the first half of the year  partially offset by a shift in product mix to increased sales of lower margin bulk products 
the lifo method of valuing inventory had no significant impact on gross profit in fiscal and negatively impacted gross profit by million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher selling costs due to additional sales staff  partially offset by lower administration costs 
operating income operating income was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million or of sales  for fiscal an million decrease in operating income for the industrial segment was partially offset by a million increase in operating income for the water treatment segment 
operating income for the industrial segment was negatively impacted by the css pension withdrawal  the litigation settlement agreement  heightened competitive pricing pressure  the addition of a new production facility and the accelerated depreciation related to the anticipated exit of a leased facility 
the lifo method of valuing inventory increased our operating income in fiscal  but reduced our operating income in fiscal investment income investment income was million for both fiscal and provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal during fiscal  we amended previously filed us federal tax returns resulting in an increase of million in the benefits related to the domestic manufacturing deduction and investment tax credits  which positively impacted our tax rate for the year 
the effective tax rate is generally impacted by projected levels of taxable income  permanent items  and state taxes 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to sales of million for fiscal vertex  which we acquired during the fourth quarter of  contributed million of the increase in sales for fiscal we also experienced increased sales as a result of higher selling prices due to increased commodity chemical prices 
sales of bulk chemicals  including caustic soda  were approximately of sales compared to approximately in the previous year 
the increase in the bulk chemical sales percentage for fiscal was primarily attributable to a full year of vertex sales volumes compared to a partial year in fiscal industrial segment 
industrial segment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal vertex contributed million of the increase in sales for fiscal we experienced higher selling prices due to increased commodity chemical prices 
water treatment segment 
water treatment segment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal the sales increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes related to manufactured and specialty chemical products and higher bulk chemical selling prices due to increased commodity chemical prices for those products 
gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit by million for fiscal primarily due to volumes and mix of commodity chemicals in inventory at the end of the year 
in the prior year  lifo negatively impacted gross 
table of contents profit by million due to rising raw material costs and higher inventory volumes on hand at year end maintained to meet customer requirements during an anticipated flood 
industrial segment 
gross profit for the industrial segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars resulted from the addition of the vertex business to this segment  partially offset by lower selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures and lower volumes 
the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal and million in fiscal water treatment segment 
gross profit for the water treatment segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily due to increased sales volumes in the latter half of the fiscal more than offsetting lower volumes resulting from unfavorable weather conditions during the first half of the year and lower selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures 
the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the addition of expenses related to the vertex business  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by one time costs we incurred in fiscal but did not experience in fiscal fiscal included approximately million in expense as a result of the death of john hawkins  our former chief executive officer  through payments due under his retention bonus agreement and the accelerated vesting of his previously granted performance based restricted stock units and stock options  as well as approximately million in vertex acquisition costs 
operating income operating income was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal a million increase in operating income for the industrial segment resulted primarily from the addition of the vertex business  partially offset by a million decrease in operating income for the water treatment segment 
both segments were negatively impacted by the lifo method of valuing inventory in fiscal and fiscal investment income investment income was million for fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in investment income was primarily due to lower cash and investment balances 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the higher effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily due to decreased permanent tax benefits and somewhat higher effective state tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal by million despite lower net income recorded  primarily due to the million non cash charge to earnings related to our withdrawal from the multiemployer pension plan 
in addition  changes in working capital balances provided million in cash in fiscal compared to cash used of million for working capital in fiscal the change in working capital balances in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in trade receivables as well as a reduction in income tax receivable balances due to lower estimated income tax payments made 
due to the nature of our operations  which includes purchases of large quantities of bulk chemicals  the timing of purchases can result in significant changes in working capital and the resulting operating cash flow 
historically  our cash requirements for working capital increase during the period from april through november as caustic soda inventory levels increase as the majority of barges are received during this period 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal was primarily due to lower proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and an increase in dividends paid during the fiscal year 

table of contents cash and investments available for sale of million at march  increased by million as compared with april   primarily due to cash generated from operations  proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the issuance of new shares of common stock through the company employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by capital expenditures and dividend payments 
investments available for sale as of march  and april  consisted of certificates of deposit with maturities ranging from three months to two years 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal significant capital expenditures in fiscal consisted of approximately million related to business expansion and process improvement projects including our new industrial facility and water treatment expansion  million for regulatory and safety improvements  million related to our new corporate headquarters and million for other facility improvements  truck and vehicle replacement  and returnable containers 
total capital spending in fiscal is currently projected to be approximately million 
we expect cash balances and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors increased our semi annual cash dividend by to per share from per share 
we have paid cash dividends continuously since future dividend levels will be dependent upon our results of operations  financial position  cash flows and other factors  and will be evaluated by our board of directors 
as part of our business growth strategy  we have acquired businesses and may pursue acquisitions or other strategic relationships in the future that we believe will complement or expand our existing businesses or increase our customer base 
we expect our cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements including acquisitions or other strategic relationships for the foreseeable future 
we periodically evaluate opportunities to borrow funds or sell additional equity or debt securities for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period contractual obligation more than years total in thousands operating lease obligations pension withdrawal liability the amounts shown in the table above assume our payments made to css as a result of our withdrawal from the multiemployer pension plan begin in november such payments will continue annually for years 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements  we follow us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we re evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we consider the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is evidence that the customer has agreed to purchase the product  the price and terms of the sale are fixed  the product has shipped and title has passed to our customer  performance has occurred  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
lifo reserve inventories are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using the lifo method 
we may incur significant fluctuations in our lifo reserve and  as a result  gross margins due primarily to changes in the volumes on hand and the per unit cost of a single  large volume component of our inventory 
the price of this inventory component fluctuates depending on the balance between supply and demand 
management reviews the lifo reserve on a quarterly basis 

table of contents inventories not valued used the lifo method are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using the fifo method 
goodwill and infinite life intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test is performed using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any  which should be recorded 
in the second step  an impairment loss would be recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses  projected capital expenditures  changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate 
the projections also take into account several factors including current and estimated economic trends and outlook  costs of raw materials  consideration of our market capitalization in comparison to the estimated fair values of our reporting units determined using discounted cash flow analyses and other factors which are beyond our control 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see item  note nature of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to the risk inherent in the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices 
however  we do not currently purchase forward contracts or otherwise engage in hedging activities with respect to the purchase of commodity chemicals 
we attempt to pass changes in material prices on to our customers  however  there are no assurances that we will be able to pass on the increases in the future
