significant differences between the effective tax rate for continuing operations and the us federal statutory rate for and are further detailed in the effective income tax rate reconciliation provided in note beginning on page our net debt balance total debt of million in excess of cash and cash equivalents of million at december  was million  compared to a net debt balance total debt of million in excess of cash and cash equivalents of million at december  of million 
net debt  a financial measure that is not calculated or presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  is not intended to represent debt as defined by us gaap  but is utilized by management in evaluating financial leverage and equity valuation 
we believe that investors also may find net debt helpful for the same purposes 
consolidated net capitalization and other credit measures are provided in the financial condition section beginning on page critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december st of each year 
our reporting units in film products include  but are not limited to  polyethylene and polypropylene films and pet films 
as of december   each of the previously identified reporting units in film products was carrying a goodwill balance 
we have two reporting units in aluminum extrusions  aacoa and bonnell 
all goodwill in aluminum extrusions is associated with the aacoa reporting unit 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and long lived identifiable assets  we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analysis and comparative enterprise value to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples 
these calculations require us to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if an impairment exists 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based upon assessments performed as to the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets  we recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations of million in  million in and million in investment accounted for under the fair value method in august and december  we made an aggregate investment of million in intelliject  a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company 
this investment is accounted for under the fair value method 
at the time of our initial investment  we elected the fair value option over the equity method of accounting since our investment objectives were similar to those of venture capitalists  which typically do not have controlling financial interests venture capital funds generally use the fair value method to account for their investment portfolios 
at december   our ownership interest was approximately on a fully diluted basis 
we disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy in which fair value measurements in their entirety fall  segregating fair value measurements using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  significant other observable inputs level  and significant unobservable inputs level 
on the dates of our investments  we believe that the amount we paid for our ownership interest and liquidation preferences was based on level 
table of contents inputs  including investments by other investors 
subsequent to the last round of financing  and until the next round of financing  we believe fair value estimates are based upon level inputs since there is no secondary market for our ownership interest 
in addition  intelliject had no product sales as of december  their first product launched in the first quarter of accordingly  after the latest financing and until the next round of financing or any other significant financial transaction  fair value estimates will primarily be based on assumptions relating to meeting product development and commercialization milestones  cash flow projections projections of development and commercialization milestone payments  sales  costs  expenses  capital expenditures and working capital investment and discounting of these factors for the high degree of risk 
at december  and  the fair value of our investment the carrying value included in other assets and deferred charges in our consolidated balance sheet was million and million  respectively 
the fair market valuation of our interest in intelliject is sensitive to changes in the weighted average cost of capital used to discount cash flow projections for the high degree of risk associated with meeting development and commercialization milestones as anticipated 
at december   the effect of a basis point decrease in the weighted average cost of capital assumption would have further increased the fair value of our interest in intelliject by approximately million  and a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital assumption would have decreased the fair value of our interest by approximately million 
any future changes in the estimated fair value of our ownership interest will likely be attributed to a new round of financing  a merger or initial public offering or adjustments to the timing or magnitude of cash flows associated with development and commercialization milestones 
adjustments to the estimated fair value of our investment will be made in the period upon which such changes can be quantified 
pension benefits we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans in our continuing operations that have resulted in varying amounts of net pension income or expense  as developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income or expense recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
the discount rate is the single rate that  when applied to expected benefit payments  provides a present value equal to the present value of expected benefit payments determined by using the aa rated bond yield curve 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
the weighted average discount rate utilized was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of  with changes between periods due to changes in market interest rates 
based on plan changes announced in  pay for active participants of the plan was frozen as of december  a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
the total return on our plan assets  which is primarily affected by the change in fair value of plan assets  current year contributions and current year payments to participants  was in  a negative in  and in our expected long term return on plan assets relating to continuing operations  which is estimated by asset class and generally based on inflation adjusted historical returns  volatilities  risk premiums and managed asset premiums  were in  in to and from to we anticipate that our expected long term return on plan assets will be for see page for more information on expected long term return on plan assets and asset mix 
see the executive summary beginning on page for further discussion regarding the financial impact of our pension plans 
income taxes on a quarterly basis  we review our judgments regarding uncertain tax positions and the likelihood that the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
as circumstances change  we reflect in earnings any adjustments to unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 

table of contents for financial reporting purposes  we had unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
tax payments resulting from the successful challenge by the taxing authority on uncertain tax positions taken by us would possibly result in the payment of interest and penalties 
accordingly  we also accrue for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
the balance of accrued interest and penalties on deductions taken relating to uncertain tax positions was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively  million and million  respectively  net of corresponding federal and state income tax benefits 
accruals for possible interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are reflected in income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
tredegar and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us  various states  and jurisdictions outside the us except for refund claims and amended returns  the internal revenue service irs has provided written confirmation that they do not plan to make any additional changes to our us consolidated tax returns for the years prior to  although the federal statute of limitations was extended through december  for the tax years with few exceptions  tredegar and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to state or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before as of december  and  we had valuation allowances relating to deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
for more information on deferred income tax assets and liabilities  see note of the notes to financial statements beginning on page recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated guidance for testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the revised standard provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further testing is necessary when performing an annual impairment assessment for indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
this new standard is comparable to the guidance finalized last year for goodwill impairment testing 
an entity can still choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we do not expect that this fasb accounting standard will have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures

see the assets and liabilities section beginning on page regarding interest rate exposures related to borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
changes in resin  pta and meg prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices as well as natural gas prices natural gas is the principal energy source used to operate our casting furnaces 
there is no assurance of our ability to pass through higher raw material and energy costs to our customers

the volatility of average quarterly prices of low density polyethylene resin in the us a primary raw material for film products is shown in the chart below 
logo resin prices in europe  asia and south america have exhibited similar long term trends 
the price of resin is driven by several factors including supply and demand and the price of oil  ethylene and natural gas 
to address fluctuating resin prices  film products has index based pass through raw material cost agreements for the majority of its business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin prices are not passed through for an average period of days see the executive summary on page and the business segment review on page for more information 
pricing on the remainder of our business is based upon raw material costs and supply demand dynamics within the markets that we compete 
the volatility of average quarterly prices of pta and meg raw materials for film products is shown in the chart below logo 
table of contents in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility see the chart below under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note beginning on page for more information 
the volatility of quarterly average aluminum prices is shown in the chart below 
logo in aluminum extrusions  we hedge from time to time a portion of our exposure to natural gas price volatility by entering into fixed price forward purchase contracts with our natural gas suppliers 
we estimate that  in an unhedged situation  every per mmbtu per month change in the market price of natural gas has a  impact on the continuing monthly operating profit for our us operations in aluminum extrusions

however  certain production costs  such as conversion costs and other fixed costs  are priced in brazilian real  which exposes our operating margins to some currency exposure 
in general  when the us dollar is strengthening versus the brazilian real  operating results will benefit from relatively lower costs  and when the us dollar is weakening versus the brazilian real  operating results will be negatively impacted from relatively higher costs
