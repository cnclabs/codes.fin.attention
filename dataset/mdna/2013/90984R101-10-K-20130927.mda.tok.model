item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and securities  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and federal home loan bank of indianapolis fhlb borrowings 
other significant sources of pre tax income are service charges on deposit accounts and other loan fees 
we also recognize income or losses from the sale of loans and investments in years that we have such sales 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and value of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations  and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
expenses 
the noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses  occupancy and equipment expenses  advertising and public relations expenses  regulatory fees and deposit insurance premiums and various other miscellaneous expenses 
salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes and expenses for health insurance and other employee benefits  and stock based compensation 
occupancy and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment  consist primarily of depreciation charges  furniture and equipment expenses  maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and costs of utilities 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to years 
advertising and public relations expenses include expenses for print  radio and television advertisements  promotions  third party marketing services and premium items 
regulatory fees and deposit insurance premiums are primarily payments we make to the fdic for insurance of our deposit accounts 
other expenses include expenses for supplies  telephone and postage  data processing  expenses related to other real estate owned by the bank  director and committee fees  professional fees  insurance and surety bond premiums and other fees and expenses 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  deferred income taxes and fair value measurements 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the statement of financial condition date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on affected loans  and the value of collateral 
inherent loss factors based upon environmental and other economic factors are then applied to the remaining loan portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio  past loss experience  current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  the occ  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
such agency may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
for additional discussion  see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed in accounting standards codification asc under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income 
the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period  which would negatively affect earnings 
united community bancorp referred to as the company  accounts for income taxes under the provisions of asc to account for uncertainty in income taxes 
the company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of june  and the company recognized no interest and penalties on the underpayment of income taxes during fiscal years june  and  and had no accrued interest and penalties on the balance sheet as of june  and the company has no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase with the next fiscal year 
the company is no longer subject to us federal  state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years ending on or before june  fair value measurements 
asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments  both assets and liabilities  whether or not recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for which it is practicable to estimate the value 
for financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available  fair values are estimated using present value or other valuation methods 
the following methods and assumptions are used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments cash and cash equivalents 
the carrying values presented in the consolidated statements of financial position approximate fair value 
investments and mortgage backed securities 
for investment securities debt instruments and mortgage backed securities  fair values are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair value is estimated using quoted market prices of comparable instruments 
loans receivable 
the fair value of the loan portfolio is estimated by evaluating homogeneous categories of loans with similar financial characteristics 
loans are segregated by types  such as residential mortgage  nonresidential real estate  and consumer 
each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest  terms  and by performing and non performing categories 
the fair value of performing loans  except residential mortgage loans  is calculated by discounting contractual cash flows using estimated market discount rates which reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan 
for performing residential mortgage loans  fair value is estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayment estimates using discount rates based on secondary market sources 
the fair value for significant non performing loans is based on recent internal or external appraisals 
assumptions regarding credit risk  cash flow  and discount rates are judgmentally determined by using available market information 
federal home loan bank stock 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system and is required to maintain an investment based upon a pre determined formula 
the carrying values presented in the consolidated statements of financial condition approximate fair value 
deposits 
the fair values of passbook accounts  interest bearing checking accounts  and money market savings and demand deposits approximate their carrying values 
the fair values of fixed maturity certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently offered for deposits of similar maturities 
advances from federal home loan bank 
the fair value is calculated using rates available to the company on advances with similar terms and remaining maturities 
off balance sheet items 
carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value 
these instruments are generally variable rate or short term in nature  with minimal fees charged 
operating strategy our mission is to operate a profitable  independent community oriented financial institution serving retail customers and small businesses in our market areas 
we are focused on prudently increasing profitability and enhancing stockholder value 
the following are key elements of our current business strategy improving our asset quality we recognize that high asset quality is a key to long term financial success 
we have sought to grow and diversify our loan portfolio  while maintaining a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk  using underwriting standards that we believe are prudent 
we also believe that we have implemented diligent monitoring and collection efforts 
historically we have not had significant losses in our lending operations 
beginning in the year ended june   we began to experience the adverse effects of the national recession and declining real estate values  negatively impacting both the ability of some of our borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing those loans 
the impact was particularly pronounced in our multi family and nonresidential real estate loan portfolios  as multi family and commercial properties suffered increases in vacancies and slowdowns in revenues  resulting in reduced cash flows as well as decreases in the market values of the underlying properties 
our nonperforming assets increased from million  or of total assets at june  to a recent high of million  or of total assets at june   of which million were multi family or nonresidential real estate loans 
our initial approach to resolving nonperforming loans focused on foreclosure and liquidations 
this manner of troubled asset resolution proved lengthy and costly as a result of legal and other operating costs  as well as the depressed values of the collateral securing the loan 
as a result  beginning in the latter part of the fiscal year ended june   we placed more attention and resources on loan workouts and implemented a troubled debt restructuring initiative that provided for either restructuring the loan to the existing borrower in recognition of the lower available cash flows from the collateral properties or identification of stronger borrowers to purchase the property and refinance the loan 
under either resolution alternative  we believe we have provided the necessary valuation allowances or charge offs to reduce the loans carrying amounts to fair value at the time of restructuring 
during the quarter ended march   management undertook a split note strategy for certain loans  restructuring them into a note a b format 
while no amount of the original indebtedness of the borrower is forgiven through this process  the full amount of note b is charged off at the time of issuance 
note a is treated as any other troubled debt restructuring  and generally may return to accrual status after performing in accordance with the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months 
the intended benefit of this strategy is that the restructuring and subsequent charge off reduces the carrying value of the loan to an as is fair value  which enables the company to liquidate delinquent loan balances without recording significant additional losses if the restructured loans experience further delinquency 
management believes that the loans that needed to be restructured in this manner represented a distinct identifiable pool of loans 
as a result of these efforts  total nonperforming loans have declined from million at june  to million at june   reflecting a million decrease in troubled debt restructurings on nonaccrual status from million at june  to million at june  the decrease in nonperforming restructured loans was the result of certain restructured loans being returned to performing status after performing in accordance with their restructured terms for more than six continuous months 
total accruing restructured loans decreased from million at june  to million at june  at june   nonresidential and multi family loans days delinquent totaled  compared to  at june  we have also implemented more stringent underwriting standards for our lending programs 
we have enhanced our document requirements and document review process 
residential real estate mortgage applicants are required to have a higher credit score than previously required 
we have reduced the maximum loan to value ratio for real estate secured consumer loans from to 
commercial and nonresidential real estate loan customers are required to provide us with rent rolls and financial statements for evaluation on a more frequent basis  and members of our loan department are in more frequent contact with these customers 
in addition  our credit analyst continues to perform an annual review of all commercial loans having an outstanding balance of at least million and every such loan is also reviewed annually by an independent third party loan reviewer 
as discussed below  we have implemented a strategy to control the growth of our nonresidential real estate and multi family real estate loan portfolios 
for additional information on this strategy  see deemphasizing the origination of multi family and nonresidential real estate loans until economic conditions improve 
improving our funding mix by attracting lower cost core retail deposits core deposits include all deposit account types except certificates of deposit and municipal deposits 
core deposits are our least costly source of funds  which improves our interest rate spread  and represent our best opportunity to develop customer relationships that enable us to cross sell our full complement of products and services 
core deposits also contribute noninterest income from account related fees and services and are generally less sensitive to withdrawal when interest rates fluctuate 
at june   core deposits represented of our total deposits compared to at june  and at june  municipal deposits represent tax and other revenues from the local gaming industry 
we have steadily reduced our reliance on municipal deposits as a percentage of total deposits 
at june   municipal deposits represented of total deposits  compared to of total deposits at june  while municipal deposits decreased million from june  to june   we continue to replace municipal deposits with core retail deposits  which increased million during the same period 
while we expect municipal deposits to continue to remain an important source of funding  we expect to continue our efforts to improve our funding mix by marketing lower cost core retail deposits 
we aggressively market core deposits through concentrated advertising and public relations 
in recent years  we have significantly expanded and improved the products and services we offer our retail and business deposit customers who maintain core deposit accounts and have improved our infrastructure for critical electronic banking services  including online banking  bill pay  estatements  merchant capture  and business online cash management tools that include ach origination  direct deposit  payroll  federal tax payment  wire transfer capabilities 
the deposit infrastructure we have established can accommodate significant increases in retail and business deposit accounts without additional capital expenditure 
deemphasizing the origination of multi family and nonresidential real estate loans until economic conditions improve our primary lending activity is the origination of one to four family mortgage loans secured by homes in our local market area of dearborn  ripley  franklin  ohio and switzerland counties  indiana 
between and  we expanded and diversified our lending activities by originating multi family and nonresidential real estate loans secured by properties in the metropolitan cincinnati market area and  to a lesser extent  in northern kentucky and the indiana counties outside of our local market area 
from june  until june   our multi family real estate loans grew from million  or of the total loan portfolio  to million  or of our total loans outstanding 
during the same period  our nonresidential real estate loans grew from million  or of total loans outstanding  to million  or of total loans outstanding 
in the cincinnati and northern kentucky markets  our multi family loans grew from million to million and our nonresidential real estate loans increased from million to million 
at june   our multi family loans were million  or of our total loans outstanding and our nonresidential real estate loans totaled million  or of our total loans outstanding 
at june   our multi family loans were million  or of our total loans outstanding and our nonresidential real estate loans totaled million  or of our total loans outstanding 
as a result of the credit quality issues arising in our multi family and nonresidential real estate loan portfolios as discussed under improving our asset quality above  in june  we implemented a strategy to control the growth of our nonresidential real estate and multi family real estate loan portfolios  particularly outside of five county local market area 
as part of this strategy  beginning in june  we restricted the origination of new multi family and nonresidential real estate loans to our local market area  and limited our multi family and nonresidential real estate lending origination activity outside of our local market area to the renewal  refinancing and restructuring of existing loans 
we also amended our loan policy to reduce our concentration limits for nonresidential real estate  multi family real estate  construction and land loans  which limits were further reduced in august  at june   we met each of these concentration limits 
since we implemented our strategy to deemphasize the origination of multi family and nonresidential real estate loans  our multi family and nonresidential loan portfolios have declined 
while we may generally consider increasing our multi family and nonresidential real estate lending origination activity in general  including in the cincinnati or northern kentucky markets  we intend to continue our strategy to deemphasize the origination of multi family and nonresidential real estate loans until the local economy materially improves and the level of our nonperforming assets consisting of these types of loans materially declines 
we believe our existing infrastructure will enable us to replace existing loans as they are repaid and prudently grow our loan portfolio in accordance with this strategy and as economic conditions permit 
continuing to increase noninterest income our earnings rely heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and other borrowings 
because of our strategy to control the growth of our nonresidential real estate and multi family real estate loan portfolios  we expect that our weighted average yield on interest earning assets will decrease in future periods because one to four family mortgage loans and investment securities generally yield less than nonresidential and multi family real estate loans 
in order to decrease our reliance on interest rate spread income  we have pursued initiatives to increase noninterest income 
our primary recurring source of non interest income has been service charges on deposit products and other services 
we have also implemented  and realize fee income from  an overdraft protection program and from customer use of debit cards 
we also have a significant secondary mortgage operation  including loan servicing  and we continue to invest in personnel and systems in order to increase our ability to sell one to four family mortgages in the secondary market to increase fee income and reduce interest rate risk through the sale of conforming fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans 
to date  all loans have been sold without recourse but with servicing retained 
the volume of loans sold totaled million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
for the years ended june  and  we recognized gains of  and  respectively  on the sale of loans 
we intend to continue to originate loans for sale in the secondary market to grow our servicing portfolio and generate additional noninterest income 
we have also enhanced our ability to increase our income from the sale of non deposit investment and insurance products in selected branch offices through lincoln financial advisors  a third party registered broker dealer  by adding two investment advisors in to serve our branch offices 
we continue to review programs to further enhance our service fee structure within the new regulatory environment 
expanding our geographic footprint we consider our primary deposit and lending market area to be dearborn  ripley  franklin  ohio and switzerland counties  indiana 
since  we have grown our community banking franchise organically through the addition of de novo branches in st 
leon and aurora  indiana  and through the strategic acquisition of three branch offices in ripley county  indiana 
as a result  we have increased our branch network from four to eight offices 
we plan to continue to seek opportunities to grow our business through a combination of de novo branching and complementary acquisitions in our existing market and contiguous markets 
we will consider acquisition opportunities that expand our geographic reach in banking  insurance or other complementary financial service businesses  although we do not currently have any agreements or understandings regarding any specific acquisition 
continuing our community oriented focus as a community oriented financial institution  we emphasize providing exceptional customer service as a means to attract and retain customers 
we deliver personalized service and respond with flexibility to customer needs 
our ability to succeed in our communities is enhanced by the stability of our senior management  who have an average tenure with the bank of over years 
we believe that our community orientation is attractive to our customers and distinguishes us from the large banks that operate in our market area 
at june   which is the most recent date for which data is available from the fdic  we held of the total deposits held by fdic insured institutions in dearborn county  which was the largest market share out of the nine financial institutions with offices in dearborn county  and of the deposits in ripley county  which was the fifth largest market share out of the 
nine 
financial institutions with offices in ripley county 
balance sheet analysis total assets were million at june   compared to million at june  total liabilities were million at june   compared to million at june  total stockholders equity was million at june   compared to million at june  total assets increased million  or  primarily as a result of a million increase in investment securities  partially offset by a million decrease in loans 
the increase in investment securities was the result of purchases of mortgage backed securities and available for sale securities with the funds received in connection with the conversion from a mutual holding company form of organization to the stock holding company form on january  the decrease in loans was primarily the result of net payoffs totaling million reduction in one to four family real estate loans  payoffs aggregating million for performing commercial real estate loans  payoff of a multi family loan totaling  and transfers to oreo totaling million during the year ended june  at june   the bank s regulatory capital exceeded the levels required to be categorized as well capitalized under applicable regulatory capital guidelines 
loans 
our primary lending activity is the origination of loans secured by real estate 
we originate one to four family residential loans  multi family and nonresidential real estate loans and construction loans 
to a lesser extent  we originate commercial and consumer loans 
from time to time  as part of our loss mitigation process  loans may be renegotiated in a troubled debt restructuring when we determine that greater economic value will ultimately be recovered under the new terms than through foreclosure  liquidation  or bankruptcy 
in determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty  we may consider the borrower s payment status and history  the borrower s ability to pay upon a rate reset on an adjustable rate mortgage  size of the payment increase upon a rate reset  period of time remaining prior to the rate reset  and other relevant factors 
we do not offer  and have not previously offered  subprime  alt a  low doc  no doc loans or loans with negative amortization and generally do not offer interest only loans 
the largest segment of our loan portfolio is one to four family residential loans 
at june   these loans totaled million  or of total gross loans  compared to million  or of total gross loans  at june  multi family and nonresidential real estate loans totaled million and represented of total loans at june   compared to million  or of total loans  at june  while repayments and charge offs have recently reduced these portfolios  they remain a substantial segment of our loan portfolio 
however  as further discussed in operating strategy deemphasizing the origination of multi family and nonresidential real estate loans until economic conditions improve  we have restricted the origination of new multi family and nonresidential real estate loans to our local market area  and limited our multifamily and nonresidential real estate lending origination activity outside of our local market area to the renewal  refinancing and restructuring of existing loans 
we intend to continue this strategy to deemphasize the origination of multi family and nonresidential real estate loans until the local economy materially improves and the level of our nonperforming assets in these segments of our loan portfolio materially declines

securities 
our securities portfolio consists primarily of us government agency mortgage backed securities and municipal bonds 
as of june   our investment securities totaled million  an increase of million from million at june  the increase in investment securities was the result of purchases of mortgage backed securities and available for sale securities with the funds received in connection with the conversion from a mutual holding company form of organization to the stock holding company form on january  the following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair values of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated

the following table sets forth the stated maturities and weighted average yields of investment securities at june  weighted average yields on tax exempt securities are not presented on a tax equivalent basis as the difference would be immaterial 
certain mortgage backed securities have adjustable interest rates and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges 
these repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below 
our callable securities consist of us government agency bonds and municipal bonds which contain either a one time call option or may be callable any time after the first call date

the mortgage originators use intermediaries generally us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises to pool and repackage the participation interests in the form of securities  with investors receiving the principal and interest payments on the mortgages 
such us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors 
mortgage backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts  and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a range and have varying maturities 
the underlying pools of mortgages  ie  fixed rate or adjustable rate  as well as prepayment risk  are passed on to the certificate holder 
the life of a mortgage backed pass through security approximates the life of the underlying mortgages 
our mortgage backed securities consist of ginnie mae securities  freddie mac securities and fannie mae securities 
ginnie mae is a government agency within the department of housing and urban development which is intended to help finance government assisted housing programs 
ginnie mae securities are backed by loans insured by the federal housing administration  or guaranteed by the department of veterans affairs 
the timely payment of principal and interest on ginnie mae securities is guaranteed by ginnie mae and backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
freddie mac is a private corporation chartered by the us government 
freddie mac issues participation certificates backed principally by conventional mortgage loans 
freddie mac guarantees the timely payment of interest and the ultimate return of principal on participation certificates 
fannie mae is a private corporation chartered by the us congress with a mandate to establish a secondary market for mortgage loans 
fannie mae guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on fannie mae securities 
freddie mac and fannie mae securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
in september  the federal housing finance agency was appointed as conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac 
the us department of the treasury agreed to provide capital as needed to ensure that fannie mae and freddie mac continue to provide liquidity to the housing and mortgage markets 
neither united community bancorp nor united community bank has invested in subprime mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities generally yield less than the loans which underlie such securities because of their payment guarantees or credit enhancements which offer nominal credit risk 
in addition  mortgage backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize our borrowings or other obligations 
mortgage backed securities generally increase the quality of our assets by virtue of the insurance or guarantees that back them  are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations of ours 
at june   approximately million of our mortgage backed and investment securities were pledged to secure various obligations of united community bank 
the actual maturity of a mortgage backed security is typically less than its stated maturity due to prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of the security and increase or decrease its yield to maturity if the security was purchased at a discount or premium  respectively 
the yield is based upon the interest income and the amortization of any premium or discount related to the mortgage backed security 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans  which decrease and increase interest income  respectively 
the prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage backed security and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  including the type of mortgages  the coupon rate  the age of mortgages  the location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of falling mortgage interest rates  if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans  refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security 
under such circumstances  united community bank may be subject to reinvestment risk because to the extent that the mortgage backed securities amortize or prepay faster than anticipated  united community bank may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of such repayments and prepayments at a comparable yield 
during periods of rising interest rates  prepayment rates of the underlying mortgages generally slow down when the coupon rate of such mortgages is less than the prevailing market rate 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation 
the evaluation is based upon factors such as the creditworthiness of the issuers guarantors  the underlying collateral  if applicable  and the continuing performance of the securities 
management also evaluates other facts and circumstances that may be indicative of an other than temporary impairment condition 
this includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of the type of security  length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost and near term prospects of the issuers 
marketable equity securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairments based on the severity and duration of the impairment and  if deemed to be other than temporary  the declines in fair value are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
for debt securities  other than temporary impairment is required to be recognized if we intend to sell the security  if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis

the decrease in interest income was the result of a decrease in the average interest rate earned on loans from at june  to at june   an million decrease in the average balance of loans and a decrease in the average rate earned on investments from at june  to at june   partially offset by a million increase in the average balance of investments 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of a decrease in the average interest rate paid on deposits from at june  to at june  changes in interest rates are reflective of decreases in overall market rates during the year ended june  average balances and yields 
the following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities  the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest earning assets  the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  and the resulting annualized average yields and costs 
the yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented 
for purposes of this table  average balances have been calculated using month end balances  and nonaccrual loans are included in average balances only 
management does not believe that the use of month end balances instead of daily average balances has caused any material differences in the information presented 
loan fees are included in interest income on loans and are insignificant

the recovery of loan losses was  for the year ended june   compared to a provision for loan losses of million for the prior year  a decrease of million 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to a  recovery in the current year on a multi family loan which had previously been charged off and which was paid off during the current year  as well as the overall improvement in asset quality 
all of the troubled debt restructurings in fiscal and represented loan relationships with long time borrowers of the company 
in measuring impairment  management considered the results of independent property appraisals  together with estimated selling expenses  and or detailed cash flow analyses

risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk and market risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities  that are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
other risks that we face are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
we have also implemented a strategy to deemphasize the origination of multi family and nonresidential real estate loans  starting in june  restricting the new origination of nonresidential and multi family residential loans to the southeastern indiana counties of dearborn  ripley  franklin  ohio and switzerland 
the intent of this strategy is to control the growth of our nonresidential real estate and multi family real estate loan portfolios  particularly with respect to loans located outside of dearborn  ripley  franklin  ohio and switzerland counties  indiana 
this strategy also emphasizes the origination of one to four family mortgage loans  which typically have lower default rates than other types of loans and are secured by collateral that  until recently  had generally tended to appreciate in value 
in august  we amended our loan policies to reduce our concentration limits for multi family and nonresidential real estate loans to and  respectively  and for construction and land loans to  of the sum of core capital plus our allowance for loan losses 
the limits were reduced because united community bank identified multi family and nonresidential real estate loans  especially those located outside our normal southeastern indiana market area  as the loan types that had experienced the most financial difficulties  which resulted in united community bank incurring losses and management being required to devote an extraordinary amount of time to overseeing these relationships 
as of june   these loans represented   and  respectively  of the sum of core capital plus our allowance for loan losses 
when a borrower fails to make a required loan payment  we take a number of steps to attempt to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
when the loan becomes days past due  a late charge notice is generated and sent to the borrower and phone calls are made 
delinquent or otherwise nonperforming mortgage loan and home equity loan customers are required to provide updated financial information and the reasons for their inability to pay or comply with the contractual terms of their loans 
if payment is not then received by the th day of delinquency  a further notification is sent to the borrower 
if no successful workout can be achieved  after a loan becomes days delinquent  we may commence foreclosure or other legal proceedings 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure 
we may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances in the form of a troubled debt restructuring 
management reports to the board of directors monthly regarding the amount of loans delinquent more than days and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own 
analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider foreclosed real estate  repossessed assets  nonaccrual loans  and troubled debt restructurings that are delinquent or have not been performing in accordance with their restructured terms for a reasonable amount of time to be nonperforming assets 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal or interest is in doubt  or at the latest when a loan becomes days delinquent 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  the accrual of interest ceases and an allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
all commercial loans that are placed on nonaccrual status are evaluated for impairment at the time the loans are placed on nonaccrual status 
payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest on a cash basis only when united community bank has determined that all principal and interest will be collected 
if there is doubt about future collection  united community bank records the entire payment against principal pursuant to the occ regulations 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as a nonperforming asset until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is initially recorded at the lower of its cost or market  less estimate selling expenses 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
prior to the recession  we had not incurred significant losses in our lending operations 
beginning in the year ended june   we began to experience the adverse effects of a significant national decline in real estate values 
the consequences of this decline were generally evident in all portfolio types  but were more pronounced in multi family and nonresidential real estate loans  particularly in markets outside of dearborn and ripley counties 
our approach to resolving nonperforming loans focused on foreclosure and liquidations in the year ended june  and the greater part of the year ended june  this manner of troubled asset resolution proved lengthy and costly as a result of legal and other operating costs  as well as the depressed values of the collateral securing the loan 
as a result  beginning in the latter part of the year ended june   management initiated a restructuring process with respect to certain nonperforming loans that provided for either restructuring the loan to the borrower in recognition of the lower available cash flows from the collateral properties or identification of stronger borrowers to purchase the property and refinance the loan 
in evaluating whether to restructure a loan  we consider the borrower s payment status and history  the borrower s ability to pay upon a rate reset on an adjustable rate mortgage as supported by a current cash flow analysis  size of the payment increase upon a rate reset  period of time remaining before the rate reset  and other relevant factors in determining whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty 
through these troubled debt restructurings  management believes they have provided the necessary valuation allowances or charge offs to reflect the loans carrying amounts at fair value 
loan workouts and modifications are handled by the president and chief executive officer  the executive vice president and chief operating officer  and the senior vice president  lending  and are subject to approval by the board of directors 
management ascertains the value of the underlying collateral  depending on whether the loan is collateral dependent or cash flow dependent 
if a loan is determined to be collateral dependent  the value of the underlying collateral is determined through an independent appraisal 
if the loan is determined to be cash flow dependent  the value of the underlying collateral is determined through an in house cash flow analysis of the property with the cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate 
once the value of collateral is established  management will either establish a specific allocation to reduce the loan s carrying value to its fair value measured using the present value of cash flows or a charge off for collateral dependent loans in an amount equal to the shortfall between the collateral value and the outstanding principal loan balance 
management will then develop and pursue a workout plan 
once a workout plan is established and implemented  management will  at a minimum  monitor the monthly performance of the loan until it is removed from nonaccrual status 
on an annual basis  management will conduct property inspections and review financial information of the borrowers and any guarantors 
in situations where a collateral shortfall ie the value of the underlying collateral of the loan is less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan is discovered  typically through an updated independent appraisal or collateral inspection  management will seek to obtain additional collateral and or a personal guaranty at that time 
if no additional collateral is available  management will work with the borrower on a suitable workout arrangement that may include a troubled debt restructuring  or management may determine to foreclose on the property 
to determine the best outcome for united community bank  management reviews the financial condition of the borrower  the cash flow of the property and the value of the loan s collateral 
if united community bank obtains a guaranty  the strength and value of the guaranty is measured by the bank at the time the loan is closed and is re evaluated at least annually 
the strength of each guaranty is determined by evaluating the guarantor s net worth  liquid net worth  debt to income ratio and credit score 
in certain circumstances  the bank may deem it appropriate not to enforce a guaranty  such as when we determine enforcing a guaranty could be detrimental to the overall banking relationship 
since december   the bank has successfully collected  from five personal guarantors and  as of june   has forbearance agreements to collect an additional million 
of the forbearance agreements two  totaling million  are in the form of liens on excess collateral on existing loans 
the remaining agreements are for smaller individual balances  and the bank is receiving regular payments on these amounts 
the entire balance of each forbearance is considered impaired and payments are treated as recoveries when received 
the company still uses guarantors and co borrowers  however  there is no reliance on required cash infusions when guarantors and co borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties 
after the restructuring is completed  if the borrower continues to experience payment difficulties  or if there is an additional decline in the collateral value identified in the annual property inspection or updated appraisal  management may impair the loan further  restructure the loan again  or foreclose on the collateral property 
at this point  management considers all of the same factors it did when the initial restructuring occurred  and attempts to resolve the situation so as to achieve the best outcome for the bank 
troubled debt restructurings are considered to be impaired and are initially treated as nonperforming 
troubled debt restructurings that are originally restructured at a market rate of interest and have a history of performance generally a minimum of consecutive months of performance under the restructured terms may be excluded from being reported as tdrs in periods subsequent to meeting this requirement 
at june   loans were considered to be troubled debt restructurings with an aggregate balance of million of which loans with an aggregate balance of million were included in nonperforming assets 
at june   loans were considered to be troubled debt restructurings with an aggregate balance of million of which loans with an aggregate balance of million were included in nonperforming assets 
the following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
at june  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans one to four family residential real estate   multi family real estate     nonresidential real estate and land  commercial consumer total nonaccrual loans     nonaccrual restructured loans one to four family residential real estate   multi family real estate     nonresidential real estate and land    total nonaccrual restructured loans    total nonperforming loans    real estate owned  total nonperforming assets    accruing restructured loans    accruing restructured loans and nonperforming assets  total nonperforming loans to total loans total nonperforming loans to total assets total nonperforming assets to total assets interest income that would have been recorded for the years ended june  and had nonaccruing loans been current according to their original terms was  and  respectively 
interest recognized on the cash basis with regard to nonaccrual restructured loans was  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
during the year ended june   nonperforming loans decreased from million to million 
the decrease in nonperforming loans in the current year was primarily the result of troubled debt restructurings that were placed on accrual performing status after performing in accordance with their restructured terms for at least six consecutive months  partially offset by additional nonperforming loans in the current year 
a discussion of united community bank s largest loans that were reported as nonperforming at either june  or june  follows 
the most significant nonaccrual loan relationships  including the five largest nonaccrual loans at june  were comprised of loan a of loan relationship a  and the loans in loan relationships b  g  i and j 
loan a of loan relationship a  which was reported as nonaccrual loans at june   was paid in full as of june  and the loan in relationship h  which was reported as nonaccrual loans at june   has been performing in accordance with its restructured terms and is reported as accruing restructured loans at june  the five largest charge offs recognized during the year ended june  were comprised of loans in loan relationships b  e  f  h and k 
loan a of loan relationship a  which was reported as a charge off at june   was paid in full as of june  and the properties securing the loan in loan relationship c  which was reported as a charge off at june   were repossessed and sold during the year ended june  except for two properties with an aggregate carrying value of  management monitors the performance of all of these loans and reviews all options available to keep the loans current  including further restructuring of the loans 
if restructuring efforts ultimately are not successful  management will initiate foreclosure proceedings 
loan relationship a 
at june   this loan relationship consisted of two loans loan a and a that had an aggregate carrying value of million 
at june   this loan relationship was comprised of four loans which had an aggregate carrying value of million 
loan a is secured by a first mortgage on an apartment complex near a college campus 
loan a is secured by a first mortgage on two mobile home parks 
loan a  which had previously been restructured in the note a b split note strategy  was paid off and with the full carrying value of each of the note a  and note b loans  being recovered in the quarter ended june  at june   loan a is included in the above table in nonaccrual restructured loans  multi family real estate and loan a is included in accruing restructured loans 
at june   loan a and loan a are included in the above table in nonaccrual restructured loans  multi family real estate 
loan a is included in accruing restructured loans 
at june  and  loans a and a were classified as multi family residential real estate  substandard in the credit risk profile by internally assigned grade table on page the loans comprising loan relationship a were originally restructured in october and november  at the time of the first restructuring in  loan a  had a carrying value of million  was days delinquent  and loans a and a were performing in accordance with their original terms 
management performed a global analysis of the borrowers and restructured each of the three loans by reducing the original loan rates by to basis points to a rate that was basis points below market rate 
foregone interest income amounted to  on the two performing loans that were restructured 
the borrowers paid a loan modification fee of  for this restructuring 
after the effect of restating the june  financial statements  management established a specific allocation on these three loans through a charge off to the general allowance for loan losses of million at june  on each of the three loans  one of the borrowers is a corporate entity 
also  on the three loans  each of the principals of the corporate borrowers individually signed as co borrowers 
at the time of the restructuring  the bank analyzed the personal net worth  liquid net worth  debt to income ratios and credit scores of the co borrowers 
while the co borrowers were not expected to cover a total loss on the loans  management believed the co borrowers would mitigate the amount of the potential future losses 
in march  loan a was again restructured through a troubled debt restructuring as a result of the borrower experiencing cash flow problems during the quarter ended march  the cash flow problems experienced were the combined effect of decreased rental income and the failure to pay real estate property taxes 
however  due to certain financial difficulties experienced by the co borrowers  including the cash flow problems of the subject properties and a decrease in other outside sources of income  the co borrowers were unable to mitigate the losses on the loan 
based upon a cash flow analysis of the properties performed by management   of the million in loans was charged off during the restructuring using the split note strategy 
this split was done for one loan that had a balance of million before the split 
after the split  note a had a balance of  and note b had a balance of  prior to the loan being restructured in march  the restructured loan carried a  specific reserve as restated on the company s form k  as amended  for the year ended june  filed with the securities and exchange commission on march  that was included in note b and charged off 
during the year ended june   loans a and a reverted to their original interest rates 
at june    loan a was days delinquent  while loan a was performing in accordance with its terms 
in july  loan a with a carrying value of million was also paid off  and the bank recovered the full principal amount of the loan  including the amount that had been charged off  plus  interest 
loan relationship b 
at june   this loan relationship consisted of four loans having an aggregate carrying value of million compared to a carrying value of million at june  as described below  these loans were previously restructuring using the note a b split note strategy 
the two note a loans in this loan relationship are included in the above table as nonaccrual restructured loans  nonresidential real estate at june   june   and june  also  at june   the aggregate carrying value of the original restructured loans are included in the above table as nonaccrual restructured loans  nonresidential real estate in the credit risk profile by internally assigned grade table on page  these loans are classified as nonresidential real estate  substandard at june  and june  the loans comprising loan relationship b were originally restructured in june  with an aggregate carrying value of million until their restructuring in the quarter ended march  these loans are secured by a first mortgage on two separate retail strip shopping centers and a single purpose commercial use property 
at the time of the original restructuring  the property value was based primarily on the collateral s cash flow  including required personal cash infusions from the co borrowers 
management believed that the lower debt service would improve the borrowers cash flow  and in turn  the performance of the loans 
one of the borrowers is a corporate entity 
the principals of the corporate borrower are also co borrowers on the note 
at the time of the restructuring  the bank analyzed the personal net worth  liquid net worth  debt to income ratios and credit scores of the co borrowers 
while the co borrowers were not expected to cover a total loss on the loans  management believed the co borrowers would mitigate the amount of potential future losses 
the restructured loans were considered impaired at june  with an allowance for loan loss of  to reflect the reduction in carrying value resulting from the exclusion of the required personal cash infusions from the co borrowers from the calculation of the carrying value 
in march  the loans comprising loan relationship b again were experiencing cash flow problems 
the cash flow problems experienced were the combined effect of the level of the required monthly loan payments  decreases in rental revenue from the properties  and the failure to pay real estate property taxes 
due to certain financial difficulties experienced by the co borrowers  including the cash flow problems of the subject properties and a decrease in other outside sources of income  the co borrowers were unable to mitigate the losses on the loan 
therefore  in march  the two loans secured by the two separate retail strip shopping centers were combined and refinanced into two loans  using the note a b split note strategy 
the first loan note a had a balance of million and was classified as substandard  reported as a troubled debt restructuring because of its below market interest rate  and placed on nonaccrual 
the second loan note b had a balance of million and was charged off inclusive of the  specific allowance recorded for this loan relationship in the quarter ended june in march  the loan secured by the single purpose commercial use property was also refinanced into two loans  using the note a b split note strategy 
the first loan note a was for  and was classified as substandard and was a troubled debt restructuring because of a below market interest rate 
the second loan note b was for  and was charged off 
the restructured loans had interest rates basis points lower than their restructured rates for a period of two years  and basis points below their original rates 
at the end of the two year period march  balloon payments would be due  unless the borrower refinanced the note a and note b loans into a market rate loans at that time 
in may  the loan secured by the two retail strip shopping centers experienced the loss of a major tenant 
as a result of the decrease in cash flow  the bank had the two retail strip shopping centers appraised in june the appraisal reflected that the value of the properties had declined to million from the previous appraisal of million in february management determined that this loan will ultimately be settled through the sale of the property 
a charge off of  was established in the quarter ended june  based on the then most recent appraisal indicating a known loss 
an additional impairment of  was established based on the bank s experience in settling foreclosed property 
the carrying value of this loan is classified as substandard  and this loan is a troubled debt restructuring 
the bank also appraised the single purpose commercial use property in june the value of this property declined to  from  in february due to decreased cash flow from the then current tenant 
management determined that this loan would also be settled from the sale of the property 
a charge off in the amount of  was established based on the then most recent appraisal indicating a known loss  and an additional impairment of  was established based on the bank s experience in settling foreclosed property 
the carrying value of this loan is classified as substandard  and this loan is a troubled debt restructuring 
during the quarter ended march   the balloon payment for the two loans secured by the two separate retail strip shopping centers became due 
an independent appraisal was performed in march on the properties reflecting that the appraised value of the properties had increased to million from million in june the loan was restructured using the note a b split note strategy in the march quarter 
the note a portion of the loan was refinanced for million  with a market interest rate of based on a year loan term  and a three year balloon payment 
as stated above  the carrying value of this loan was put on nonaccrual  classified as substandard  and reported as a troubled debt restructuring 
the second loan note b was for million was charged off 
this charged off amount equaled the amount of the note b loan balance in march million plus that portion note a balance in march that was charged off during the period ended june  million 
during the quarter ended march   the balloon payments for the two loans secured by the single purpose commercial use property became due 
the two loans secured by the single purpose commercial use property were modified again using the note a b split note strategy 
the first loan note a was modified to a balance of  with a market interest rate of  for a year term  and a three year balloon payment 
as stated above  the carrying value of this loan was put on nonaccrual  classified as substandard  and reported as a troubled debt restructuring 
the second loan note b was modified at its then current balance of  was charged off 
this charged off amount equaled the amount of the note b loan balance in march  plus that portion note a having a balance in march that was charged off during the period ended june  
the two note a loans in loan relationship b were performing in accordance with their restructured terms at june  loan relationship c 
at june   there were no loans in loan relationship c 
however  there were properties that previously secured the loans in this prior relationship in oreo having with an aggregate carrying value of  compared to two loans outstanding having an aggregate carrying value of million at june  the two original loans included in this relationship had an aggregate value of million prior to being restructured in the quarter ended march  one loan was secured by a first mortgage on a single family home 
the other loan was secured by a unit apartment complex  six one to four family residential properties and ten residential building lots 
in march  these two loans were combined and restructured into two loans  using the note a b split note strategy 
the two loans using the split note strategy had an aggregate carrying value of million at june  the first loan note a is included in the above table in accruing restructured loans at june   and in nonaccrual restructured loans  multi family real estate at june  and june  in the credit risk profile by internally assigned grade table on page  the note a loan is classified as multi family real estate  substandard at june  and june  the loans comprising loan relationship c were originally restructured in august at the time of the first restructuring  management established a specific reserve through a charge off to the general allowance for loan losses of  in august  the loans were originally restructured by reducing the interest rates on the loans by a range of to basis points to a rate that was basis points below market rate 
these loans were performing at the initial time of the restructuring in august  but the borrowers were beginning to experience cash flow difficulties 
management believed that the lower debt service would improve the borrowers cash flow  and in turn  the performance of the loans 
at the time the loans were initially restructured  independent appraisals were performed on each piece of underlying collateral 
these appraisals supported the aggregate million carrying value of the two loans 
one of the borrowers was a corporate entity with one principal who has personally signed on the loan 
at the time of the initial restructuring  we analyzed the personal net worth  liquid net worth  debt to income ratios and credit scores of the co borrower and determined that the co borrower was not expected to cover a total loss  but would mitigate the amount of potential future losses 
based on the restatement of the june  audited consolidated financial statements  these loans were considered impaired at june   with an allowance for loan losses of  established to reflect the reduction in the carrying value resulting from the exclusion of the required personal cash infusions from the calculation of the carrying value 
during the quarter ended march  the borrower again began to experience cash flow difficulties and these loans were refinanced  reported as a troubled debt restructuring and placed on nonaccrual 
the cash flow problems experienced by the borrower resulted in the failure to pay required monthly loan payments  association dues  and real estate property taxes 
due to certain financial difficulties experienced by the co borrower  including the cash flow problems of the subject properties and a decrease in other outside sources of income  the co borrower was unable to mitigate the losses on the loan 
as stated above  based upon a cash flow analysis of the properties performed by management  the loans were restructured during the quarter ended march   utilizing the note a b split note strategy 
after the restructuring  the previous aggregate balance of million was split into two notes with note a having a balance of million which was classified as substandard  and note b having a balance of  which was charged off 
a restructuring fee of  was charged and included in note b at march  the restructured loans had an interest rate that was basis points lower than the restructured rate for a period of two years  and to basis points below the original rates 
at the end of the two year period  balloon payments were due  unless the borrower refinanced into a market rate loan at that time 
at june   the carrying value of note a was million 
this relationship was performing in accordance with its restructured terms at june  during the quarter ended september   the bank commenced negotiations with the borrower to repossess these properties 
these negotiations were completed in the quarter ended december  the borrower agreed to deed back to the bank the unit apartment complex  five of the seven one to four family residential properties  and the ten residential building lots 
the other two one to four family residential properties were retained by the borrower with the agreement that the borrower would either sell  refinance with another financial institution  or deed back to the bank these two properties during the quarter ended march  the properties deeded back to the bank were put in oreo during the quarter ended december  and had an aggregate carrying value of million at december  the two properties retained by the borrower had a net carrying value of  at december  as supported by independent appraisals performed on those properties in the quarter ended december  during the quarter ended december   the bank began to sell the properties it had repossessed 
during that quarter  it sold the unit apartment complex  three of the one to four family residential properties and four residential building lots  generating total proceeds of million 
during the quarter ended march   one of the two remaining one to four family residential properties that secured the loan having a net carrying value of  was refinanced by the borrower with another financial institution  and the borrower paid down the remaining loan to  the other property that secured this loan was deeded back to the bank and put in oreo in the amount of  as a result  there was no balance remaining on this loan relationship at march  additionally  during the quarter ended march   the bank sold two repossessed residential building lots generating total proceeds of  the oreo balance as of march  was  during the quarter ended june   the bank sold the remaining three repossessed one to four family residential properties  and two more of the repossessed residential building lots  generating total proceeds of  the oreo balance as of june   as stated above  was  based on the appraisals of the remaining repossessed properties in oreo  the bank does not expect any additional losses to result from this loan relationship 
loan relationship d 
at june  and june   loan relationship d was comprised of two loans which had an aggregate carrying value of million 
the loans are secured by a first mortgage on a unit apartment complex near a college campus 
there are no personal guarantees or co borrowers on these loans 
originally  there was only one loan in loan relationship d 
loan relationship d was originally comprised of one loan that was restructured in december the loan was made in to a seasoned property manager who made major improvements to the property 
the property was purchased in december from a bank borrower who was delinquent at the time of acquisition 
at the time the loan was acquired from the delinquent borrower in  it was restructured with a new borrower  in lieu of foreclosure  pursuant to which the bank loaned the borrower funds to purchase and renovate the property 
at the time of the restructuring  management established a specific reserve through a charge off to the general allowance for loan losses of  there was no personal guarantee or co borrower on this loan 
the loan required interest only payments through december at the time of the acquisition  management believed that the new borrower would be able to renovate the property with a view toward improving the property s cash flow  and in turn  the performance of the loan

at june   there were loans that required payments of principal and interest  and five loans that required interest payments only 
at june   there were loans that required payments of principal and interest  and nine loans that required interest payments only 
the economic trends during the year ended june  were generally stable in our primary market area  dearborn and ripley counties in indiana  the overall increases in troubled debt restructurings from june  to june  are related to financial difficulties encountered by borrowers during the years ended june  to june  federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the occ has the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
when we classify an asset as special mention  we account for those classifications when establishing a general allowance for loan losses 
if we classify an asset as substandard  doubtful or loss  we establish a specific allocation for the asset at that time 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets at the dates indicated

the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans no less than quarterly 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
the recommendations for increases or decreases to the allowance are presented by management to the board of directors 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allocation on identified impaired loans  and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
allowance required for identified impaired loans 
we establish a specific allocation of the general allowance or a charge off on certain identified impaired loans based on such factors as the strength of the property s or the business cash flows  the availability of other sources of repayment  the amount due or past due  the type and value of collateral  the strength of our collateral position  the estimated cost to sell the collateral  and the borrower s effort to cure the delinquency 
general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
we establish a general allowance for homogenous loans and loans that are not days delinquent to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning historical loss percentages to each category 
the percentages are adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas and the national economy  staff lending experience  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  specific reserve and classified asset trends  delinquency trends and risk rating trends 
these loss factors are subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
as a result of our systematic analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the loss factors we presently use to determine the reserve level are based on various risk factors such as trends in underperforming loans  trends and concentrations in loans and loan volume  economic trends in our market area  particularly the impact of the gaming and tourism industry on the economy of our market area  the effect of which has become significant in recent periods 
we also identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans  classified loans and other loans that management may have concerns about collectability 
on a monthly basis  management reviews all substandard commercial loans and all loans that are more than days delinquent 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews all classified assets and on an annual basis  management reviews all major lending relationships relationships greater than million 
the review of major lending relationships includes completing an updated property inspection report  and obtaining current tax returns and financial information about the borrower and the property 
when collateral dependent impaired loans are identified  management will reduce the loan to fair value and charge off the difference between the outstanding balance and fair value to the allowance for loan losses 
impaired loans measuring fair value under the present value of cash flows are allocated a portion of the general allowance using a specific allocation to reduce the loans carrying value to the present value of estimated cash flows 
no less than quarterly  management will review the allowance for loan losses based upon the criteria discussed above and make adjustments to the allowance accordingly 
any commercial loan that is included in delinquent loans  classified loans  or other loans about which management may have concerns is individually reviewed for impairment on a monthly basis 
for individually reviewed loans  the borrowers inability to make payments under the terms of these loans  or the existence of a shortfall in the collateral value relating to these loans  could result in our allocating a portion of the allowance to the loans that were impaired 
at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans and amounted to million 
at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans and amounted to million 
at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total loans and of nonperforming loans and amounted to million at such date compared to million at june  from june  to june   the loan portfolio experienced decreases of million in nonperforming loans  million in nonperforming assets  and million in troubled debt restructurings 
classified assets decreased million 
a review of these factors  offset by a  recovery on a multi family loan which had previously been charged off and which was paid off during the current year  resulted in the net recovery of loan losses of  for the year ended june  the fiscal decreases in nonperforming loans  nonperforming assets  and troubled debt restructurings were the result of troubled debt restructuring loans making payments in accordance with their restructured terms for sufficient periods of time to allow the loans to be placed on accruing status

when a loan first becomes a troubled debt restructuring  it is included in nonaccrual loans until a history of at least six consecutive monthly payments can be established 
troubled debt restructurings are also classified as substandard assets for the life of the restructured terms 
because nonaccrual loans are included in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets and are also considered classified assets  the payment in accordance with restructured terms of the troubled debt restructurings by certain of the restructured loans permit them to be re classified as performing was the primary reason for the decrease in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets 

del del 
additionally  from june  to june  the loan portfolio experienced an aggregate decrease of  in loans days delinquent 
this change is attributable to the improved payment history of loan customers 
the recovery of loan losses was  for the year ended june   compared to a provision for loan losses of million for the prior year  a decrease of million 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to a  recovery in the current year on a multi family loan which had previously been charged off and which was paid off during the current year  as well as the overall improvement in asset quality 
the amount of the provision in the year ended june  was the result of continued weakness in nonresidential and multi family markets  primarily reflecting charge offs on two loans that were restructured using the note a b split note strategy during the fiscal year ended june  and the one previously restructured relationship that experienced further weaknesses due to the loss of tenants during the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans coverage ratio increased from to from june  to june  this increase was a result of restructured loans performing in accordance with their restructured terms 
at june  and  troubled debt restructurings were and of nonperforming loans  respectively 
troubled debt restructurings have generally been charged off or written down to their fair value at the time of the restructuring 
the fair value at the time of restructuring is determined by a recent independent appraisal or cash flow analysis of the underlying collateral 
as a result of the recent fair value determinations of a majority of the loans that are included in nonperforming loans  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased from june  to june  the following table illustrates the changes to the allowance for loan losses for the year ended june  one to four family mortgage owner occupied consumer one to four family mortgage non owner occupied multi family non residential real estate construction land commercial and agricultural total in thousands allowance for credit losses beginning balance   charge offs recoveries provision  ending balance   balance  individually evaluated balance  collectively evaluated  financing receivables ending balance   ending balance individually evaluated for impairment  ending balance collectively evaluated for impairment  ending balance loans acquired at fair value   the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated

furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that the occ  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
the occ may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
analysis of loan loss experience 
the following table sets forth an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
year ended june  dollars in thousands allowance at beginning of period    provision for recovery of loan losses   charge offs one to four family residential real estate land  nonresidential real estate   multi family real estate   consumer and other loans total charge offs    recoveries one to four family residential real estate nonresidential real estate and land multi family real estate consumer and other loans total recoveries net charge offs    loss on restructuring of loans allowance at end of period    allowance to nonperforming loans allowance to total loans outstanding at the end of the period net charge offs to average loans outstanding during the period the charge offs in the year ended june  reflect overall improvement in asset quality and were also reduced as a result of a  recovery of a multi family loan which had previously been charged off and which was paid off during the year ended june  the charge offs in the year ended june  were primarily the result of reductions in the appraised values of collateral related to nonperforming loans 
the charge offs in the year ended june  were primarily the result of the previously mentioned restructurings of loans having an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million 
charge offs in the year ended june  were primarily the result of one loan secured by a mobile home park 
the loan was charged off in september  and taken into other real estate owned at that time 
the property was sold in february  and we restructured the loan to the new borrower as a troubled debt restructuring 
the loan is included in accruing restructured loans and was performing in accordance with its restructured terms at june  charge offs in the year ended june  primarily resulted from four loans comprising two lending relationships 
three of the loans  included in one relationship for a landscape nursery  were charged off in august   the inventory and assets from the business were liquidated  and the real estate was taken into other real estate owned 
the real property was sold in june  and we financed the sale as a troubled debt restructuring 
due to its performance history  it was classified as an accruing troubled debt restructuring and was performing according to its restructured terms at june  the fourth loan was related to loan relationship d included in analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
in december  this loan was restructured into two loans using the note a b split note strategy 
the a loan has performed in accordance with its restructured terms for six months 
at june   this loan was classified as nonaccrual troubled debt restructuring 
the b loan was charged off in december  interest rate risk management 
we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes adjusting the maturities of borrowings  adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration  and generally selling in the secondary market newly originated conforming fixed rate  and year one to four family residential real estate loans and available for sale securities 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have an asset liability committee  which includes members of management and board members  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
economic value of equity analysis 
we use an economic value of equity analysis prepared by a consulting firm to review our level of interest rate risk 
this analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in net economic value of our cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
economic value of equity represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
these analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or and basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
because of the low level of market interest rates  these analyses are not performed for decreases of more than basis points 
the following table presents the change in our net economic value of equity at june  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change 
economic value of equity dollars in thousands economic value of equity as of economic value of total assets basis point bp change in rates amount change change economic value ratio the model uses various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analyses presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity 
liquidity management 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demands  expected deposit flows  in particular municipal deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june  securities classified as available for sale whose market value exceeds our cost  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at june  total securities classified as available for sale were million at june  in addition  we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately million from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis at june  at june   united community bank s total commitment to extend credit at variable rates was million 
the amount of fixed rate commitments was approximately million at june  the fixed rate loan commitments at june  have interest rates ranging from to 
in addition  the bank had  of letters of credit outstanding at june  certificates of deposit due within one year of june  totaled million 
this represented of certificates of deposit at june  we believe the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before june  we believe  however  based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
the following table presents certain of our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years dollars in thousands long term debt obligations    operating lease obligations   total      our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities 
our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit relationships 
occasionally  we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits 
the following table presents our primary investing and financing activities during the periods indicated 
year ended june  dollars in thousands investing activities loans disbursed or closed   loan principal repayments   proceeds from maturities and principal repayments of securities proceeds from sales of securities available for sale  purchases of securities   proceeds from sale of other real estate owned  increases in bank owned life insurance policies   capital expenditures financing activities decrease increase in deposits   borrowings from federal home loan bank   repayments of federal home loan bank advances  proceeds from stock coversion  dividends paid to stockholders   cash contributed by united community mhc common stock acquired by esop  repurchases of common stock capital management 
united community bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the occ  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at june   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see regulation and supervision federal institution regulation capital requirements  and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  letters of credit and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item to this annual report on form k 
we currently have no plans to engage in hedging activities in the future 
for the year ended june   we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
