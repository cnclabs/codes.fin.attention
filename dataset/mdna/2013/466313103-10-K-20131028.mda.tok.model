we provide comprehensive electronics design  production and product management services to companies in the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  healthcare  industrial  instrumentation  medical  networking  packaging  peripherals  solar  storage and telecommunications industries 
the industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing  design and aftermarket services to companies that utilize electronics components 
the industry experienced rapid change and growth through the s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion  and  in some cases  all of their manufacturing requirements 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector at the time 
in response to this downturn in the technology sector  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
industry revenues generally began to stabilize in and companies began to turn more to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing 
in addition  the number of industries serviced  as well as the market penetration in certain industries  by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined when a deteriorating macro economic environment resulted in illiquidity in global credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the north american  european and asian markets 
in response to this downturn  we implemented additional restructuring programs  including the restructuring plan that was approved by our board of directors in fiscal year the restructuring plan  to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
uncertainty remains regarding the extent and timing of the current global economic recovery  particularly in those countries such as in much of europe where economic conditions remain at risk 
we will continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change 
we manage our business and operations in the following three segments diversified manufacturing services dms  enterprise infrastructure e i and high velocity systems hvs 
our dms segment is composed of dedicated resources to manage higher complexity global products in regulated and other industries and introduce materials and process technologies including design and aftermarket services to our global customers 
our e i and hvs segments offer integrated global manufacturing and supply chain solutions designed to provide cost effective solutions for our customers 
our e i segment is focused on our customers primarily in the computing  storage  networking and telecommunication sectors 
our hvs segment is focused on the particular needs of the consumer products industry  including mobility  display  set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers and point of sale terminals 
we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we generally assume no significant obligations after product shipment 

table of contents our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in research and development r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the us are denominated in local currencies 
we economically hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
see risk factors we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
we currently depend  and expect to continue to depend  upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth  viability and financial stability 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers  a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us or the termination or substantial winding down of our business relationship with one of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design  production or product management services ordered from us  including moving a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay the volume of design  production or product management services ordered from us  or move a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity 
we are currently terminating or substantially winding down our business relationship with blackberry limited this could include restructuring related expenses  which are still being determined and could have a material adverse effect  one of our significant customers in recent years  and could in the future terminate  or substantially wind down  other significant customer relationships 
any such termination or substantial winding down of a customer or manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue  risk factors most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures  and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity  risk factors our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  delay production or change their sourcing strategy and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year increased approximately to billion compared to billion for fiscal year largely due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers  including new program wins with these customers 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ended august  certain key operating results and other financial information in thousands  except per share data 
fiscal year ended august  net revenue gross profit operating income net income attributable to jabil circuit  inc earnings per share basic earnings per share diluted key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results 
the following table sets forth  for the quarterly periods indicated  certain of management s key financial performance indicators 
three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns annualized turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns annualized turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory  less the days in accounts payable  accordingly  the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators 
during the three months ended august   days in accounts receivable increased four days to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of the timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter 
during the three months ended may   february  and november   the days in accounts receivable decreased six days to days  decreased two days to days and increased five days to days  respectively  from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of sales and collections activity 
during the three months ended august   days in inventory decreased four days to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter due to continued focus on inventory management and increased sales activity during the quarter 
during the three months ended may   days in inventory decreased four days to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely due to continued focus on inventory management and increased sales activity during the quarter 
during the three months ended february   days in inventory increased three days to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely to support expected revenue levels in the third quarter of fiscal year during the three months ended november   days in inventory increased one day to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely to support revenue levels in the first month of the second quarter of fiscal year inventory turns  on an annualized basis  increased one turn to eight turns during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and remained constant at seven turns during the third  second and first quarters of fiscal year the increase during the fourth quarter of fiscal year was primarily due to continued focus on inventory management 
during the three months ended august   may   february  and november   days in accounts payable remained constant at days  decreased two days to days  decreased two days to days and increased four days to days  respectively  from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters 

table of contents the sales cycle was days during the three months ended august   days during the three months ended may   days during the three months ended february  and days during the three months ended november  the changes in the sales cycle are due to the changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we generally assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage  customer inventory related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset s or asset group s are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions 
for further discussion of our current restructuring program  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and related charges 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill 
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss  if any 

table of contents we perform an indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value 
we determine the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach  known as the relief from royalty method 
if the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  the indefinite lived intangible asset is considered impaired 
we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite lived intangible assets are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
retirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates  compensation rate increases and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits  refer to note postretirement and other employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria 
we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements 
our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances and or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
the internal revenue service irs completed its field examination of the company s tax returns for the fiscal years through and fiscal years through and issued revenue agent s reports rar on april  and april   respectively 
the proposed adjustments primarily related to the irs contentions that certain corporate expenses relate to services provided to foreign affiliates and therefore must be charged to those affiliates and valuable intangible property was transferred to certain foreign affiliates without charge 
on august   the tax return audit for fiscal years through was effectively settled when the company agreed to the irs office of appeals form ad offer to waive restrictions on assessment and collection of tax deficiency and to accept overassessment adjustments  which were substantially lower than the initial rar proposed adjustments 
the settlement did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or liquidity and no additional tax liabilities were recorded

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenue fiscal year ended august  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles restructuring and related charges impairment of notes receivable and related charges settlement of receivables and related charges loss on disposal of subsidiaries operating income other expense interest income interest expense income before income tax income tax expense net income net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of income tax expense net income attributable to jabil circuit  inc fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year specific increases include a increase in the sale of dms products  a increase in the sale of e i products  and a increase in the sale of hvs products 
the increases are primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers  most notably in dms and e i  including new program wins with these customers 
generally  we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition 
accordingly  we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business 
in addition  the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure 
the distribution of revenue across our sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recessionary conditions  efforts to de emphasize the economic performance of certain sectors  most specifically  our former automotive and display sectors  seasonality in our business  business growth from new and existing customers  and the current termination or substantial winding down of our business relationship with blackberry limited this could include restructuring related expenses  which are still being determined and could have a material adverse effect and any other potential future termination  or substantial winding down  of other significant customer relationships

table of contents foreign source revenue represented of our net revenue for fiscal year and of net revenue for fiscal year we currently expect our foreign source revenue to remain relatively consistent as compared to current levels over the course of the next months 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal year billion or of net revenue remained relatively consistent as compared to fiscal year billion or of net revenue 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue for fiscal year compared to million of net revenue for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively consistent as compared to the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expense on a gross basis increased as compared to fiscal year due to additional salary and salary related expenses associated with increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business  additional selling  general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions  including nypro inc nypro during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and telmar network technology  inc telmar during the second quarter of fiscal year  and million in professional fees associated with the due diligence and other acquisition related activities associated with the nypro acquisition 
research and development 
r d expenses for fiscal year increased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the increase is primarily due to new projects in targeted growth sectors  such as the emerging growth sector within dms 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august   partially offset by an increase to amortization expense associated with the finite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of nypro and telmar 
for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets  note goodwill and other intangible assets and note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and related charges 
in conjunction with the restructuring plan  we charged million of restructuring and related charges to the consolidated statement of operations during the fiscal year ended august  the restructuring plan is intended to better align our manufacturing capacity in certain geographies and to reduce our worldwide workforce in order to reduce operating expenses 
these restructuring activities are intended to address current market conditions and customer requirements 
the restructuring and related charges for the fiscal year ended august  include million related to employee severance and benefit costs  million related to asset write off costs  million related to lease costs and million related to other related costs 
at august   accrued liabilities of approximately million related to the restructuring plan are expected to be paid over the next twelve months 
these restructuring and related charges associated with the restructuring plan incurred during the fiscal year ended august  of million are primarily cash costs totaling million  of which million was paid in fiscal year the cash costs consist of employee severance and benefit costs of million  lease costs of million and other related costs of million 
non cash costs of million primarily represent asset write off costs related to our restructuring activities 
we currently expect to recognize approximately million in pre tax restructuring and other related costs over the course of fiscal years  and under the restructuring plan 
a majority of the total restructuring costs are expected to be related to employee severance and benefit arrangements 
the charges related to the restructuring plan  excluding asset write off costs  are currently expected to result in cash expenditures in a range of million to million that will be payable over the course of our fiscal years  and the exact amount and timing of these charges and cash outflows  as well as the estimated cost ranges by category type  have not been finalized 
much of the restructuring plan as discussed reflects our intention only and restructuring decisions  and the timing of such decisions  at certain plants are still subject to the finalization of timetables for the transition of functions and consultation with our employees and their representatives 

table of contents upon its completion  the restructuring plan is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately million 
the expected avoided annual costs consist of a reduction in employee related expenses of million  a reduction in depreciation expense associated with asset disposals of million  and a reduction in rent expense associated with leased buildings that have been vacated of approximately million 
the majority of these annual cost savings are expected to be reflected as a reduction in cost of revenue as well as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expense 
these annual costs savings are expected to be partially offset by decreased revenues and incremental costs expected to be incurred by those plants to which certain production will be shifted 
after considering these partial cost savings offsets  we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately million 
we began to realize a portion of these costs savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year impairment of notes receivable and related charges 
during the fiscal year ended august   we recorded a loss of approximately million related to a notes receivable and related charges 
such a charge was recorded following the determination that it was probable that we would be unable to collect the amounts due from a former customer 
other expense 
other expense decreased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to million of expense recognized during fiscal year related to fair value adjustments associated with customer warrants 
interest income 
interest income remained relatively constant at million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year interest expense 
we recorded million of interest expense in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to incremental interest associated with the issuance of the senior notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and increased borrowings associated with our five year unsecured credit facility amended as of december  the amended and restated credit facility 
income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate decreased from the previous period primarily due to a million partial release of the us valuation allowance related to the us deferred tax liabilities from the nypro acquisition  which represent future sources of taxable income to support the realization of the deferred tax assets 
the us deferred tax liabilities from the nypro acquisition primarily relate to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and non deductible intangible assets 
the effective tax rate also decreased due to the release of a non us valuation allowance 
the fiscal year effective tax rate decreases were partially offset by restructuring costs with minimal related tax benefit in fiscal year  a release of tax reserves related to a non us governmental tax audit in fiscal year  and the mix of income or losses within the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of during these periods primarily due to a a partial release of the us valuation allowance related to the us deferred tax liabilities from the nypro acquisition  b the release of a non us valuation allowance  c income in tax jurisdictions with lower statutory tax rates than the us  d tax incentives granted to sites in brazil  malaysia  poland  singapore  and vietnam and e income and losses in tax jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances 
the material tax incentives expire at various dates through such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply

fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year specific increases included a increase in the sale of specialized services products  a increase in the sale of instrumentation and healthcare products and a increase in the sale of industrial and clean tech products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the sale of hvs products and a decrease in the sale of e i products 
the increases were primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers  most notably in dms  including new program wins with these customers 
the decreases in e i and hvs revenues were primarily due to a decline in the end market demand for certain customer products in these segments  partially offset by an increase in the sale of printer and storage products due to new program wins

gross profit remained constant at billion of net revenue for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue for fiscal year compared to million of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue between fiscal years and was due to additional salary and salary related expenses associated with increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business and additional selling  general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions  including f i holding company which directly or indirectly wholly owns certain french and italian operations during the second quarter of fiscal year and telmar during the second quarter of fiscal year research and development 
r d expenses for fiscal year remained relatively constant at million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august   partially offset by an increase to amortization expense associated with the definite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of telmar

restructuring and related charges 
a 
restructuring plan during fiscal year  we reversed million of previously recognized restructuring and related charges 
b 
restructuring plan during fiscal year  we recorded approximately million of restructuring and related charges 
the restructuring and related charges for fiscal year were primarily related to lease commitment costs 
settlement of receivables and related charges 
we recorded a loss on settlement of receivables and related charges of million during fiscal year during the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed our acquisition of f i holding company  which directly or indirectly wholly owns competence france holdings sas  a french entity which wholly owns competence france sas  and competence emea srl  an italian entity which wholly owns competence italia srl competence france holdings sas  competence france sas  competence emea srl and competence italia srl are collectively referred to as the competence sites herein 
the competence sites were our former operations and were previously disposed of on july  refer to note loss on disposal of subsidiaries to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  immediately prior to the acquisition of the competence sites  we recognized a charge of million in order to record million in receivables and other relationships with the competence sites at their respective fair values 
in addition  we recognized acquisition costs and other related charges of million during the second quarter of fiscal year refer to note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
loss on disposal of subsidiaries 
we recorded a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of million during fiscal year other expense 
other expense increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to an incremental loss of million recognized during fiscal year under the foreign asset backed securitization program  largely due to such expense being recorded to interest expense during a portion of the comparable period as the program was accounted for as a secured borrowing until may  and million of expense recognized during the fiscal year related to fair value adjustments associated with customer warrants 
refer to note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the foreign asset backed securitization program 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease during these periods was primarily due to reduced cash investments 

table of contents interest expense 
we recorded million of interest expense in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased borrowings associated with the amended and restated credit facility 
these increases were partially offset by the losses recognized in connection with the asset backed securitization programs that were recorded to interest expense during the fiscal year ended august  because the asset backed securitization programs were accounted for as secured borrowings for a portion of the period 
refer to note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the asset backed securitization programs 
income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate increased from the previous period primarily due to the mix of tax rates and the expiration of tax incentives in various jurisdictions in which we do business  partially offset by the release of tax reserves related to the settlement of a non us governmental tax audit in fiscal year and no tax benefit related to the acquisition losses of f i holding company in fiscal year most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  due to lower statutory tax rates and tax incentives granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  malaysia  poland  singapore and vietnam 
the hungarian incentive and the majority of the chinese incentives expired during fiscal year the remaining material tax incentives expire at various dates through such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply

non us gaap core financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non us gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below 
the non us gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non us gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time 
non us gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 
also  our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items which are excluded from our core financial measures 
management believes that the non us gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles  distressed customer charge  stock based compensation expense and related charges  restructuring and related charges  impairment of notes receivable and related charges  acquisition costs and purchase accounting adjustments  settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries 
among other uses  management uses non us gaap core financial measures as a factor in determining certain employee performance when determining incentive compensation 
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings  by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations 
a significant portion based on the respective values of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets  resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset 
in the case of restructuring charges  we may be making associated cash payments in the future 
in addition  although  for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings  we exclude stock based compensation expense which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future because it is a non cash expense  the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock  which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest 
we encourage you to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in excluding them

see risk factors we have on occasion not achieved  and may not in the future achieve  expected profitability from our acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at august   we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling billion  total notes payable  long term debt and capital lease obligations of billion  billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities and up to million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable securitization and committed and uncommitted sale programs 
we can offer no assurance under the uncommitted sales programs that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity  including our revolving credit facilities 
cash flows the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years ended august selected consolidated cash flow information in thousands fiscal year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was approximately billion 
this resulted primarily from net income of million  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  million in non cash depreciation and amortization expense  million in stock based compensation expense and a million decrease in inventories  which were partially offset by million in deferred income taxes and an million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily driven by the timing of purchases and cash payments 
the decrease in inventories was primarily a result of a continued focus on inventory management 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to increases in the deferred purchase price receivable under our asset backed securitization programs due to higher levels of sales and the timing of cash funding provided by the unaffiliated conduits and financial institutions as well as an increase in advanced deposits 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was billion 
this consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million principally for machinery and equipment for new business  particularly within our dms segment and maintenance levels of machinery and equipment and million of net cash paid for business acquisitions 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year was million 
this resulted from our receipt of approximately billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements  which primarily included billion of borrowings under the amended and restated credit facility and million of borrowings under various credit facilities with foreign facilities 
this was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of approximately billion during fiscal year  which primarily included an aggregate of billion of repayments under the amended and restated credit facility and approximately million of repayments under various credit facilities with foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  we paid million to repurchase  of our common shares  million in dividends to stockholders and million to the irs on behalf of certain employees to satisfy minimum tax obligations related to the vesting of certain restricted stock awards as consideration for these payments to the irs  we withheld million of employee owned common stock related to this vesting during the fiscal year ended august  sources we may need to finance day to day working capital needs  as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs  with additional borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility which is further discussed in the following paragraphs and our other revolving credit facilities described below  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
currently  we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future  from time to time over the three years following the registration  to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
the current shelf registration statement will expire in the first quarter of fiscal year at which time we currently anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement 
any future sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current or future shareholders 
further  we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations  increase debt service obligations  limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants  potentially negatively affect our credit ratings  and limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy 
we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common shares 
we regularly sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset backed securitization programs  a factoring program  a committed trade accounts receivable sale program and two uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs collectively referred to herein as the programs 
transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and  accordingly  net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
discussion of each of the programs is included in the following paragraphs 
in addition  refer to note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the programs 
a 
asset backed securitization programs we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under our asset backed securitization programs to special purpose entities  which in turn sell of the receivables to conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions for the north american asset backed securitization program and an unaffiliated financial institution for the foreign asset backed securitization program 
any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid in cash upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable  which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected 
net cash proceeds up to a maximum of million for the north american asset backed securitization program  currently scheduled to expire on october   and million for the foreign asset backed securitization program  currently scheduled to expire on may   are available at any one time 

table of contents in connection with our asset backed securitization programs  at august   we had sold million of eligible trade accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total sold outstanding receivables at that date 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million  and a deferred purchase price receivable 
at august   the deferred purchase price receivable in connection with the asset backed securitization programs totaled approximately million 
the deferred purchase price receivable was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
b 
trade accounts receivable factoring agreement in connection with a factoring agreement  we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary without recourse to a third party purchaser in exchange for cash 
proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount 
in april  the factoring agreement was extended through september   at which time it was automatically renewed for an additional six month period 
during the fiscal year ended august   we sold million of trade accounts receivable and received cash proceeds of million 
c 
trade accounts receivable sale programs in connection with three separate trade accounts receivable sale agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions  we may elect to sell  at a discount  on an ongoing basis  up to a maximum of million  million and million  respectively  of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time 
the million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is a committed facility that was renewed during the third quarter of fiscal year and is scheduled to expire on november  the million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility scheduled to expire on november  the million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility and is scheduled to expire no later than june   though either party may elect to cancel the agreement by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than days 
during the fiscal year ended august   we sold billion of trade accounts receivable under these programs and we received cash proceeds of billion

e as of august   six of our foreign subsidiaries have credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs 
four of the credit facilities are denominated in us dollars  one is denominated in brazilian reais and one is denominated in taiwan new dollar 
the credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from to 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we entered into the amended and restated credit facility which provides for a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of billion 
the amended and restated credit facility may  subject to lenders discretion  potentially be increased up to billion and expires on march  interest and fees on the amended and restated credit facility advances are based on our non credit enhanced long term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by s p and moody s 
interest is charged at a rate equal to either to above the base rate or to above the eurocurrency rate  where the base rate represents the greatest of citibank  na s prime rate  above the federal funds rate  or above one month libor  and the eurocurrency rate represents adjusted libor for the applicable interest period  each as more fully described in the amended and restated credit facility agreement 
fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
we  along with our subsidiaries  are subject to the following financial covenants a maximum ratio of a debt as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement to b consolidated ebitda as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement and a minimum ratio of a consolidated ebitda to b interest payable on  and amortization of debt discount in respect of  all debt as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement and loss on sale of accounts receivables

table of contents limitation upon accounting changes  limitation upon subsidiary debt  limitation upon sales  etc 
of assets  limitation upon changes in nature of business  payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries  compliance with laws  etc  payment of taxes  etc  maintenance of insurance  preservation of corporate existence  etc  visitation rights  keeping of books  maintenance of properties  etc  transactions with affiliates  and reporting requirements 
during fiscal year  we borrowed billion against the amended and restated credit facility under multiple draws and paid billion under multiple payments 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we borrowed billion against the amended and restated credit facility under multiple draws and repaid billion under multiple payments 
f during the third quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a master lease agreement with a variable interest entity the vie whereby we sell to and subsequently lease back from the vie up to million in certain machinery and equipment for a period of up to five years 
in connection with this transaction  we hold a variable interest in the vie  which was designed to hold debt obligations payable to third party creditors 
the proceeds from such debt obligations are utilized to finance the purchase of the machinery and equipment that is then leased by us 
we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as we have both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
therefore  we consolidate the financial statements of the vie and eliminate all intercompany transactions 
at august   the vie had approximately million of total assets  of which approximately million was comprised of a note receivable due from us  and approximately million of total liabilities  of which approximately million were debt obligations to the third party creditors as the vie has utilized approximately million of the million debt obligation capacity 
the third party creditors have recourse to our general credit only in the event that we default on our obligations under the terms of the master lease agreement 
in addition  the assets held by the vie can be used only to settle the obligations of the vie 
in addition to the loans described above  at august   we have borrowings outstanding to fund working capital needs 
these additional loans total approximately million  of which million are denominated in euros and million are denominated in us dollars 
g during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we acquired various capital lease obligations in connection with the acquisition of nypro 
h this amount represents the fair value hedge accounting adjustment related to the senior notes 
for further discussion of our fair value hedges  see note derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements at august  and  we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended and restated credit facility  respectively and our securitization programs 
uses on october   january  april   and july   our board of directors approved payment of a quarterly dividend of per share to shareholders of record as of november   february   may   and august   respectively 
of the total cash dividend declared on october  of million  million was paid on december  of the total cash dividend declared on january  of million  million was paid on march  of the total cash dividend declared on april  of million  million was paid on june  of the total cash dividend declared on july  of million  million was paid on september  the remaining million that was not paid during each quarter is related to dividend equivalents on unvested restricted stock units that will be payable at the time the awards vest 
we currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations 
however  the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of million of our common shares 
we repurchased million worth of shares during the first quarter of fiscal year  which was the remaining amount outstanding of the million authorized by our board of directors in fiscal year in the first quarter of fiscal year  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common shares during the twelve month period following their authorization 
the shares were repurchased during the first quarter of fiscal year utilizing the entire million authorized by our board of directors 

table of contents our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions 
it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments  changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment 
at august   we had approximately billion in cash and cash equivalents 
as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states  a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we estimate that approximately million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the united states without potential income tax consequences 
at august   however  we intend to repatriate the nypro pre acquisition undistributed foreign earnings of approximately million to our us operations 
therefore  we recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately million based on the anticipated us income taxes of the repatriation 
we intend to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
for discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we currently anticipate that during the next months  our capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million  principally for maintenance levels of machinery and equipment  information technology infrastructure upgrades and investments to support ongoing growth in our dms operations 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  additional proceeds available under our trade accounts receivable securitization programs and committed trade accounts receivable sale program and potentially available under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs and funds provided by operations  will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures  the payment of any declared quarterly dividends and our working capital requirements for the next months 
as discussed in note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements  we completed our acquisition of nypro during the fourth quarter of fiscal year by acquiring of the issued and outstanding common shares of nypro for net aggregate consideration of million  which was funded from available cash 
our million north american asset backed securitization program is scheduled to expire on october  and our million foreign asset backed securitization program is scheduled to expire on may   and we may be unable to renew either of these 
our million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is a committed facility that amended and restated an existing uncommitted facility during the first quarter of fiscal year to change the facility to a committed facility and to reduce the capacity from million to million 
our million trade accounts receivable sale agreement was renewed during the third quarter of fiscal year and is scheduled to expire on november  our million trade accounts receivable sale agreement is an uncommitted facility that was entered into during the first quarter of fiscal year and is scheduled to expire on november  our million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program is scheduled to expire no later than june   though either party can elect to cancel the agreement by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than days 
we can offer no assurance under the uncommitted sales programs that if we attempt to sell receivables under such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity  including our revolving credit facilities 
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
see risk factors our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements and capital lease obligations  future interest on notes payable  long term debt and capital lease obligations  future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements  non cancelable purchase order obligations for property  plant and equipment  pension and postretirement contributions and payments and capital commitments as of august  are summarized below 
while  as disclosed below  we have certain non cancelable purchase order obligations for property  plant and equipment  we generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer 
non cancelable purchase orders do not typically extend beyond the normal lead time of several weeks at most 
purchase orders beyond this time frame are typically cancelable

e during the first quarter of fiscal year  we committed million to an independent private equity limited partnership which invests in companies that address resource limits in energy  water and materials commonly referred to as the cleantech sector 
of that amount  we have invested million as of august  f at august   we have million and million recorded as a current and a long term liability  respectively  for uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments  or the amount by which our liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time  and accordingly  this liability has been excluded from the above table

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in various foreign countries and are  therefore  subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable  intercompany transactions and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity 
we do not  and do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair values 
at august   except for certain foreign currency contracts with a notional amount outstanding of million and a fair value of million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million recorded in other accrued expenses  we have elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required for the transactions to qualify as accounting hedges and  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded within our consolidated statements of operations 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at august  that do not qualify as accounting hedges was billion 
the fair value of these contracts amounted to a million asset recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a million liability recorded to other accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets 
the forward contracts both those that are designated as accounting hedging instruments and those that are not will generally expire in less than three months  with thirteen months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at august  the change in fair value related to contracts designated as accounting hedging instruments will be reflected in the net revenue or expense line in which the underlying transaction occurs within our consolidated statements of operations

table of contents based on our overall currency rate exposures as of august   including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  an immediate hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our domestic investment portfolio 
we do not  and do not intend to  use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions 
we protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate these risks by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy 
the portfolio typically includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
at august   there were no significant outstanding investments 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a series of interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes 
under these interest rate swaps  we received fixed rate interest payments and paid interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a spread 
the effect of these swaps was to convert fixed rate interest expense on a portion of the senior notes to floating rate interest expense 
gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded to interest expense and offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying senior notes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we terminated the interest rate swaps entered into in connection with the senior notes with a fair value of million  including accrued interest of million at august  the portion of the fair value that is not accrued interest is recorded as a hedge accounting adjustment to the carrying amount of the senior notes and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
at august   the hedge accounting adjustment recorded is million in the consolidated balance sheets 
we pay interest on several of our outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
there were million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities at august  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note notes payable  long term debt and capital lease obligations to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations 
the effect of an immediate hypothetical change in variable interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
