item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest expense 
all fdic insured financial institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board 
the bonds  which are referred to as fico bonds  were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation  and the assessments will continue until the bonds mature in affiliate transaction restrictions we are subject to the affiliate and insider transaction rules applicable to member banks of the federal reserve as well as additional limitations imposed by the occ 
these provisions prohibit or limit a banking institution from extending credit to  or entering into certain transactions with  affiliates  principal stockholders  directors and executive officers of the banking institution and its affiliates 
the dodd frank act imposed further restrictions on transactions with affiliates and extension of credit to executive officers  directors and principal stockholders that were effective as of july  incentive compensation in june  the us bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of us banks do not undermine the safety and soundness of such banks by encouraging excessive risk taking 
the guidance  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of a bank  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a bank s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the bank s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governance  including active and effective oversight by the bank s board of directors 
the u 
s bank regulatory agencies will review  as part of the regular  risk focused examination process  the incentive compensation arrangements of us banks that are not large  complex banking organizations 
these reviews will be tailored to each bank based on the scope and complexity of the bank s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements 
the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination 
deficiencies will be incorporated into the bank s supervisory ratings  which can affect the bank s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions 
enforcement actions may be taken against a bank if its incentive compensation arrangements  or related risk management control or governance processes  pose a risk to the bank s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 
federal reserve numerous regulations promulgated by the federal reserve affect the business operations of the bank and us 
these include regulations relating to electronic fund transfers  collection of checks  availability of funds  and cash reserve requirements 
bank secrecy act the bsa requires all financial institutions  including banks  to  among other things  establish a risk based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
the bsa includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting  as well as due diligence know your customer documentation requirements 
the bank has established a global anti money laundering program in order to comply with bsa requirements 
usa patriot act of the usa patriot act of the patriot act  which was enacted following the events of september   includes numerous provisions designed to detect and prevent international money laundering and to block terrorist access to the us financial system 
we have established policies and procedures intended to fully comply with the patriot act s provisions  as well as other aspects of anti money laundering legislation and the bsa 
office of foreign assets control regulation the united states has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries  nationals and others 
these are typically known as the ofac rules based on their administration by the us treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac 
the ofac administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms 
generally  however  they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country  including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in  or providing investment related advice or assistance to  a sanctioned country  and ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest  by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons 
blocked assets eg  property and bank deposits cannot be paid out  withdrawn  set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac 
failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences 
consumer protection laws and regulations the bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations  the examination and enforcement of which has become more pronounced 
pursuant to the dodd frank act the cfpb has assumed the responsibility for the development and enforcement of the federal consumer protection statutes and regulations  such as the truth in lending act the tila  the equal credit opportunity act the ecoa  the real estate settlement procedures act respa and the truth in saving act 
the dodd frank act gave the cfpb broad rule making  supervisory and examination authority in this area over financial institutions  such as the bank  that have assets of billion or more and expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans and authority to prevent unfair  deceptive and abusive practices 
the consumer complaint function of the occ also has been transferred into the cfpb 
the dodd frank act also narrows the scope of federal preemption of state laws related to federally chartered financial institutions  including savings banks such as the bank 
predatory lending 
federal regulations require additional disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers for certain lending practices  including predatory lending 
the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
predatory lending typically involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower ability to repay an obligation  inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced  also known as loan flipping  and or engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
many states also have predatory lending laws  and although the bank may be exempt from those laws due to federal preemption  they do apply to the brokers and correspondents from whom we purchase loans and  therefore have an effect on our business and our sales of certain loans into the secondary market 
glba 
the glba includes provisions that protect consumers from the unauthorized transfer and use of their non public personal information by financial institutions 
privacy policies are required by federal banking regulations which limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public personal information about consumers to non affiliated third parties 
pursuant to those rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose non public personal information to non affiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to non affiliated third parties 
these privacy protections affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
in addition  states are permitted under the glba to have their own privacy laws  which may offer greater protection to consumers than the glba 
numerous states in which the bank does business have enacted such laws 
fact act 
the fair credit reporting act  as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act the fact act  requires financial firms to help deter identity theft  including developing appropriate fraud response programs  and gives consumers more control of their credit data 
it also reauthorizes a federal ban on state laws that interfere with corporate credit granting and marketing practices 
in connection with the fact act  us bank regulatory agencies proposed rules that would prohibit an institution from using certain information about a consumer it received from an affiliate to make a solicitation to the consumer  unless the consumer has been notified and given a chance to opt out of such solicitations 
a consumer election to opt out would be applicable for at least five years 
ecoa 
the ecoa generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
tila 
the tila is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments  including the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total of payments and the payment schedule  among other things 
in addition  the tila also provides a variety of substantive protections for consumers 
fh act 
the fair housing act the fh act regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing related lending activities against any person because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
a number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be  or may be considered illegal  under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
hmda 
the home mortgage disclosure act the hmda grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods and provides public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
the hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
in  the federal reserve amended regulations issued under hmda to require the reporting of certain pricing data with respect to higher priced mortgage loans 
this expanded reporting is being reviewed by us bank regulatory agencies and others from a fair lending perspective 
respa 
lenders are required by respa to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
violations of respa may result in civil liability or administrative sanctions 
enforcement actions under the above laws may include fines  reimbursements and other penalties 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with the fact act  ecoa  tila  fh act  hmda and respa generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local community 
community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act cra requires the bank to ascertain and help meet the credit needs of the communities it serves  including low to moderate income neighborhoods  while maintaining safe and sound banking practices 
the primary banking agency assigns one of four possible ratings to an institution cra performance and is required to make public an institution rating and written evaluation 
the four possible ratings of meeting community credit needs are outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve and substantial non compliance 
in  the bank received a satisfactory cra rating from the ots as predecessor to the occ and this remains our current rating 
regulatory reform on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
this law has changed the current bank regulatory structure and affected the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies  including us and the bank 
various federal agencies have begun to adopt a broad range of rules and regulations and are given significant discretion in drafting these rules and regulations 
consequently  many of the details and much of the impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for many months or years 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  the ots ceased to exist on july  and its functions were transferred to the occ and the federal reserve 
after the transfer  the federal reserve became our primary regulator and supervisor  and the occ became the primary regulator and supervisor of the bank 
except as described below  however  the laws and regulations applicable to us and the bank did not generally change by virtue of the elimination of the ots the hola and the regulations issued under the dodd frank act do still apply although these laws and regulations will be interpreted by the federal reserve and the occ  respectively 
the dodd frank act also transferred to the cfpb the responsibility for the development and enforcement of the federal consumer protection statutes and regulations  such as tila  ecoa  respa and the truth in saving act 
the dodd frank act contains a number of provisions intended to strengthen capital 
for example  the bank regulatory agencies are directed to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital that are at least as stringent as those currently in effect 
in addition  we will be subject to consolidated capital requirements for the first time and will be required to serve as a source of strength to the bank 
the dodd frank act also expands the affiliate transaction rules in sections a and b of the federal reserve act to broaden the definition of affiliate and to apply to securities lending  repurchase agreement and derivatives activities that the bank may have with an affiliate  as well as to strengthen collateral requirements and limit federal reserve exemptive authority 
also  the definition of extension of credit for transactions with executive officers  directors and principal shareholders is expanded to include credit exposure arising from a derivative transaction  a repurchase or reverse repurchase agreement and a securities lending or borrowing transaction 
these expansions became effective one year after the transfer date 
these provisions did not have a material effect on us or the bank 
the dodd frank act will require publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and so called golden parachute payments 
in addition  the federal reserve adopted a rule addressing interchange fees applicable to debit card transactions which lowered fee income generated from this source 
the reduced debit card fee income did not have a material impact on the bank 
the dodd frank act requires the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies defined as hedge funds and private equity funds  with implementation starting in july the statutory provision is commonly called the volcker rule 
the proposed rules are highly complex  and many aspects of their application remain uncertain 
based on the proposed rules  we do not currently anticipate that the volcker rule will have a meaningful effect on our operations or those of our subsidiaries  as we do not materially engage in the businesses prohibited by the volcker rule 
we may incur costs if required to adopt additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the volcker rule  but any such costs are not expected to be material 
until a final rule is adopted  the precise financial impact of the rule on us  our customers or the financial industry more generally  cannot be determined 
regulatory enforcement both the occ and the fdic may take regulatory enforcement actions against any of their regulated institutions  such as the bank  that do not operate in accordance with applicable regulations  policies and directives 
proceedings may be instituted against any banking institution  or any institution affiliated party  such as a director  officer  employee  agent or controlling person  who engages in unsafe and unsound practices  including violations of applicable laws and regulations 
both the occ and the fdic have authority under various circumstances to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured institution that it regulates  to issue cease and desist orders  to obtain injunctions restraining or prohibiting unsafe or unsound practices  to revalue assets and to require the establishment of reserves 
the fdic has additional authority to terminate insurance of accounts  after notice and hearing  upon a finding that the insured institution is or has engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice that has not been corrected  is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  or order of  or condition imposed by  the fdic 
in addition  the federal reserve may take regulatory enforcement actions against us  and the cfpb has the authority to take regulatory enforcement actions against us or the bank 
federal home loan bank system the primary purpose of the federal home loan banks fhlbs is to provide loans to their respective members  such as the bank  in the form of collateralized advances for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development lending 
the fhlbs are generally able to make advances to their member institutions at interest rates that are lower than the members could otherwise obtain 
the fhlb system consists of regional fhlbs  each being federally chartered but privately owned by their respective member institutions 
the federal housing finance agency  a government agency  is generally responsible for regulating the fhlb system 
the bank is currently a member of the fhlb of indianapolis 
environmental regulation our business and properties are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing environmental matters  including the regulation of hazardous substances and wastes 
for example  under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended  and similar state laws  owners and operators of contaminated properties may be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances without regard to whether such persons actually caused the contamination 
such laws may affect us both as an owner or former owner of properties used in or held for our business  and as a secured lender on property that is found to contain hazardous substances or wastes 
our general practice is to obtain an environmental assessment prior to foreclosing on commercial property 
we may elect not to foreclose on properties that contain such hazardous substances or wastes  thereby limiting  and in some instances precluding  the liquidation of such properties 
competition we face substantial competition in attracting deposits and making loans 
our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other savings banks  commercial banks and credit unions in our local market areas 
money market funds and full service securities brokerage firms also compete with us for deposits and  in recent years  many financial institutions have competed for deposits through the internet 
we compete for deposits by offering high quality and convenient banking services at a large number of convenient locations  including longer banking hours and sit down banking in which a customer is served at a desk rather than in a teller line and offering a broad range of treasury management products 
we may also compete by offering competitive interest rates on our deposit products 
from a lending perspective  there are a large number of institutions offering mortgage loans  consumer loans and commercial loans  including many mortgage lenders that operate on a national scale  as well as local savings banks  commercial banks  and other lenders 
with respect to those products that we offer  we compete by offering competitive interest rates  fees  and other loan terms banking products and services and by offering efficient and rapid service

item a 
risk factors our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these risk factors include the following 
market  interest rate  credit and liquidity risk our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally 
the financial services industry has been materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a significant and prolonged period of negative economic conditions 
this was initially triggered by declines in the values of subprime mortgages  but spread to virtually all mortgage and real estate asset classes  to leveraged bank loans and to nearly all asset classes 
the us economy has continued to be adversely affected by these events as shown by high unemployment across most industries  and high delinquencies and defaults on loans 
there is also evidence of strategic defaults on loans  which are characterized by borrowers that appear to have the financial means to satisfy the required loan payments as they come due but choose not to do so because the value of the assets securing their debts such as the value of a house securing a residential mortgage may have declined below the amount of the debt itself 
further  there are several states  such as california  in which many residential mortgages are effectively non recourse in nature or in which statutes or regulations cause collection efforts to be unduly difficult or expensive to pursue 
there are also a multitude of commercial real estate loans throughout the united states that are soon to mature  and declines in commercial real estate values nationwide could prevent refinancing of the debt and thereby result in an increase in delinquencies  foreclosures and non performing loans  as well as further reductions in asset values 
the decline in asset values to date has resulted in considerable losses to secured lenders  such as the bank  that historically have been able to rely on the underlying collateral value of their loans to be minimize or eliminate losses 
there can be no assurance that property values will stabilize or improve and if they continue to decline  there can be no assurance that the bank will not continue to incur significant credit losses 
prior market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a number of the largest financial institutions in the united states and global marketplaces and could recur 
financial institution failures or near failures have resulted in further losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under bilateral derivatives and other contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties 
furthermore  declining asset values  defaults on mortgages and consumer loans  and the lack of market and investor confidence  as well as other factors  have all combined to increase swap spreads  cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings  and otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity  despite very significant declines in central bank borrowing rates and other government actions 
banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses and often have become reluctant to lend  even on a secured basis  due to the increased risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the value of collateral 
while there have been moderate improvements during in a number of macroeconomic factors which impact our business  near term concerns remain over unemployment  the us mortgage market  depressed real estate values  access to credit and liquidity markets  energy costs  and global political issues such as sovereign debt defaults 
there can be no assurance that the current economic downturn will improve  and as a result  our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected 
if we cannot effectively manage the impact of the volatility of interest rates our earnings could be adversely affected 
our main objective in managing interest rate risk is to maximize the benefit and minimize the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on our earnings over an extended period of time 
in managing these risks  we look at  among other things  yield curves and hedging strategies 
as such  our interest rate risk management strategies may result in significant earnings volatility in the short term because the market value of our assets and related hedges may be significantly impacted either positively or negatively by unanticipated variations in interest rates 
in particular  our portfolio of msrs and our mortgage pipeline are highly sensitive to movements in interest rates  and hedging activities related to the portfolio 
our profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest margin  which is the difference between the rates we receive on loans made to others and investments and the rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funds 
our profitability also depends in substantial part on the volume of loan originations and the related fees received from our mortgage banking segment 
our net interest margin and our volume of mortgage originations will depend on many factors that are partly or entirely outside our control  including competition  federal economic  monetary and fiscal policies  and global and domestic economic conditions generally 
historically  net interest margin and the mortgage origination volumes for the bank and for other financial institutions have widened and narrowed in response to these and other factors 
also  our volume of mortgage originations will also depend on the mortgage qualification standards imposed by the gses  such that if their standards are tightened  our origination volume could be reduced 
our goal has been to structure our asset and liability management strategies to maximize the benefit of changes in market interest rates on our net interest margin and revenues related to mortgage origination volume 
however  a sudden or significant change in prevailing interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
increasing long term interest rates may decrease our mortgage loan originations and sales 
generally  the volume of mortgage loan originations is inversely related to the level of long term interest rates 
during periods of low long term interest rates  a significant number of our customers may elect to refinance their mortgages ie  pay off their existing higher rate mortgage loans with new mortgage loans obtained at lower interest rates 
our profitability levels and those of others in the mortgage industry have generally been strongest during periods of low and or declining interest rates  as we have historically been able to sell the resulting increased volume of loans into the secondary market at a gain 
during and  the interest rate environment was quite favorable for mortgage loan originations  particularly refinancing activity  in large part due to government intervention through the purchase of mortgage backed securities and other federal monetary policies and heightened global demand for investment in us treasury obligations  all of which facilitated a low rate interest rate environment for the residential mortgage market 
in addition  there were wide spreads between short and long term interest rates for much of  resulting in higher profit margins on loan sales than in prior periods 
there is no guarantee that these conditions will persist  and a change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
when interest rates fluctuate  repricing risks arise from the timing difference in the maturity and or repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
while such repricing mismatches are fundamental to our business  they can expose us to fluctuations in income and economic value as interest rates vary 
our interest rate risk management strategies do not completely eliminate repricing risk 
a significant number of our depositors are believed to be rate sensitive 
because of the interest rate sensitivity of these depositors  there is no guarantee that in a changing interest rate environment we will be able to retain all funds in these accounts 
current and further deterioration in the housing and commercial real estate markets may lead to increased loss severities and further increases in past due loans and non performing assets in our loan portfolios 
consequently  our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses  and we may be required to materially increase reserves 
a good portion of our loans held for investment portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by real estate in which we are in the first lien position 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses because borrowers  guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted to address this risk may not prevent unexpected losses that could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects 
unexpected losses may arise from a wide variety of specific or systemic factors  many of which are beyond our ability to predict  influence or control 
as with most lending institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable and inherent losses in our loans held for our investment portfolio 
our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses  and future provisions for credit losses could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of the probable and inherent losses in our portfolio of held for investment loans at the relevant statement of financial condition date 
our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio  composition and maintaining our current revenue pace of the portfolio and economic factors 
the determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently subjective process that requires significant management judgment and is based on numerous assumptions 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that may be beyond our control and these losses may exceed current estimates 
moreover  our regulators  as part of their supervisory function  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
our regulators may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or to recognize further losses  based on their judgment  which may be different from that of our management 
the results of such reviews may have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 
the housing and the residential mortgage markets have continued to experience a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions 
if market conditions remain poor or further deteriorate  they may lead to additional valuation adjustments on loan portfolios and real estate owned as we continue to reassess the fair value of our non performing assets  the loss severities of loans in default  and the fair value of real estate owned 
we may also realize additional losses in connection with our disposition of non performing assets 
poor economic conditions could result in decreased demand for residential housing  which  in turn  could adversely affect the value of residential properties 
a sustained weak economy could also result in higher levels of non performing loans in other categories  such as commercial loans  which may result in additional losses 
management continually monitors market conditions and economic factors throughout our footprint for indications of change in other markets 
if these economic conditions and market factors negatively and or disproportionately affect our loans  then we could see a sharp increase in our total net charge offs and also be required to significantly increase allowance for loan losses 
any further increase in our non performing assets and related increases in our provision expense for losses on loans could negatively affect our business and could have a material adverse effect on our capital  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in the fair value of our securities may reduce our stockholders equity  net earnings  or regulatory capital ratios 
at december   we had million of securities classified as available for sale 
the estimated fair value of available for sale securities portfolio may increase or decrease depending on market conditions 
our securities portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate securities 
we increase or decrease stockholders equity by the amount of the change in the unrealized gain or loss difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost of available for sale securities portfolio  net of the related tax benefit  under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
therefore  a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders equity  as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share 
this decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold 
in the case of debt securities  if these securities are never sold  the decrease may be recovered over the life of the securities 
we conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if the decline in the fair value of any security below its cost basis is other than temporary 
factors which are considered in the analysis include  but are not limited to  the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the security  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the decline appears to be related to issuer conditions or general market or industry conditions  intent and ability to retain the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value and the likelihood of any near term fair value recovery 
generally these changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates are viewed as temporary  which is consistent with experience 
if we deem such decline to be other than temporary related to credit losses  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged to earnings as a component of non interest income 
in the past  we recorded other than temporary impairment otti charges 
our securities portfolio is monitored as part of ongoing otti evaluation process 
no assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize otti charges related to securities in the future 
the capital that the bank is required to hold for regulatory purposes is impacted by  among other things  the securities ratings 
therefore  ratings downgrades on our securities may have a material adverse effect on our risk based regulatory capital ratios 
certain hedging strategies that we use to manage investment in msrs may be ineffective to offset any adverse changes in the fair value of these assets due to changes in interest rates and market liquidity 
we invest in msrs to support mortgage strategies and to deploy capital at acceptable returns 
we also deploy derivatives and other fair value assets as economic hedges to offset changes in fair value of the msrs resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments stemming from changing interest rate environments 
the primary risk associated with msrs is that they will lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments due to loan refinancing prompted  in part  by declining interest rates 
conversely  these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated 
there is also a risk of valuation decline due to higher than expected increases in default rates  but we do not believe such risk can be sufficiently quantified to effectively hedge 
our hedging strategies are highly susceptible to prepayment risk  basis risk  market volatility  and changes in the shape of the yield curve  among other factors 
in addition  hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding assets and general market factors 
if one or more of these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds  we may incur losses that would adversely impact earnings 
our ability to borrow funds  maintain or increase deposits or raise capital could be limited  which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings 
our access to external sources of financing  including deposits  as well as the cost of that financing  is dependent on various factors including regulatory restrictions 
a number of factors could make funding more difficult  more expensive or unavailable on any terms  including  but not limited to  further reductions in debt ratings  financial results and losses  changes within the organization  specific events that adversely impact reputation  disruptions in the capital markets  specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry  counterparty availability  changes affecting assets  the corporate and regulatory structure  interest rate fluctuations  general economic conditions and the legal  regulatory  accounting and tax environments governing funding transactions 
many of these factors depend upon market perceptions of events that are beyond our control  such as the failure of other banks or financial institutions 
other factors are dependent upon results of operations  including but not limited to material changes in operating margins  earnings trends and volatility  funding and liquidity management practices  financial leverage on an absolute basis or relative to peers  the composition of the consolidated statements of financial condition and or capital structure  geographic and business diversification  and our market share and competitive position in the operating segments 
the material deterioration in any one or a combination of these factors could result in a downgrade of our credit or servicer standing with counterparties or a decline in our financial reputation within the marketplace and could result in our having a limited ability to borrow funds  maintain or increase deposits including custodial deposits for our agency servicing portfolio or to raise capital 
also  we compete for funding with other banks and similar companies  many of which are substantially larger  and have more capital and other resources than we do 
in addition  as some of these competitors consolidate with other financial institutions  these advantages may increase 
competition from these institutions may increase our cost of funds 
our ability to make mortgage loans and fund our investments and operations depends largely on our ability to secure funds on terms acceptable to us 
our primary sources of funds to meet our financing needs include loan sales and securitizations  deposits  which include custodial accounts from our servicing portfolio and brokered deposits and public funds  borrowings from the fhlb or other federally backed entities  borrowings from investment and commercial banks through repurchase agreements  and capital raising activities 
if we are unable to maintain any of these financing arrangements  are restricted from accessing certain of these funding sources by our regulators  are unable to arrange for new financing on terms acceptable to us  or if we default on any of the covenants imposed upon us by our borrowing facilities  then we may have to reduce the number of loans we are able to originate for sale in the secondary market or for our own investment or take other actions that could have other negative effects on our operations 
a sudden and significant reduction in loan originations that occurs as a result could adversely impact our earnings  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to renew or maintain our financing arrangements or deposits or that we will be able to adequately access capital markets when or if a need for additional capital arises 
defaults by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally 
the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit or other relationships between and among institutions 
as a result  concerns about  or a default or threatened default by  one institution could lead to significant market wide liquidity and credit problems  losses or defaults by other institutions 
this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries  such as banks with which we interact on a daily basis  and therefore could adversely affect us 
we may be required to raise capital at terms that are materially adverse to stockholders 
during past years  capital was raised at terms that were significantly dilutive to the stockholders 
there can be no assurance that we will not suffer additional losses or that additional capital will not otherwise be required for regulatory or other reasons 
in those circumstances  we may be required to obtain additional capital to maintain regulatory capital ratios at or above their current levels 
such capital raising could be at terms that are dilutive to existing stockholders and there can be no assurance that any capital raising undertaken would be successful 
regulatory risk our business is highly regulated and the regulations applicable to us are subject to change 
the banking industry is extensively regulated at the federal and state levels 
insured financial institutions and their holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by financial regulatory authorities covering all aspects of their organization  management and operations 
currently  the bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the occ  the fdic and the cfpb 
in addition  the federal reserve is responsible for supervising and regulating all savings and loan holding companies that were formerly regulated by the ots  including us 
the federal reserve is also authorized to impose capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies and subject such companies to new and potentially heightened examination and reporting requirements 
savings and loan holding companies  including us  are also required to serve as a source of financial strength to their financial institution subsidiaries 
the occ is the primary regulator of the bank and its affiliated entities 
in addition to its regulatory powers  the occ has significant enforcement authority that it can use to address banking practices that it believes to be unsafe and unsound  violations of laws  and capital and operational deficiencies 
the fdic also has significant regulatory authority over the bank and may impose further regulation at its discretion for the protection of the dif 
such regulation and supervision are intended primarily for the protection of the dif and for the bank s depositors and borrowers  and are not intended to protect the interests of investors in our securities 
the cfpb is responsible for enforcement of the principal federal consumer protection laws over institutions that have assets of billion or more  such as the bank 
further  the bank business is affected by consumer protection laws and regulation at the state and federal level  including a variety of consumer protection provisions  many of which provide for a private right of action and pose a risk of class action lawsuits 
in the current environment  there have been  and will likely be  significant changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regime in light of recent government intervention in the financial services industry  and it is not possible to predict the impact of all such changes on our results of operations 
changes to  or in the interpretation or implementation of  statutes  regulations or policies  heightened regulatory scrutiny  requirements or expectations  implementation of new government programs and plans  and changes to judicial interpretations of statutes or regulations could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
for example  regulators views of capital adequacy has been evolving since the economic recession 
as a result  while we have historically operated at lower tier capital levels  we are currently operating at a tier capital ratio of greater than percent and do not currently intend to operate at lower tier capital levels in the future 
among other things  such changes  as well as the implementation of such changes  could result in unintended consequences and could subject us to additional costs  constrain our resources  limit the types of financial services and products that we may offer  increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  and or reduce our ability to effectively hedge against risk 
the bank has entered into a consent order with the occ  which requires the bank to adopt or review and revise various plans  policies and procedures related to  among other things  regulatory capital  enterprise risk management and liquidity 
while subject to the consent order  the bank management and board of directors will be required to focus a substantial amount of time on complying with its terms  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
non compliance with the consent order may lead to additional corrective actions by the occ which could negatively impact our operations and financial performance 
effective october   the bank entered into a consent order with the occ 
under the consent order  the bank is required to adopt or review and revise various plans  policies and procedures related to  among other things  regulatory capital  enterprise risk management and liquidity 
specifically  under the terms of the consent order  the bank board of directors has agreed to  among other things  take the following actions review  revise  and forward to the occ a written capital plan for the bank covering at least a three year period and establishing projections for the bank overall risk profile  earnings performance  growth expectations  balance sheet mix  off balance sheet activities  liability and funding structure  capital and liquidity adequacy  as well as a contingency capital funding process and plan that identifies alternative capital sources should the primary sources not be available  adopt and forward to the occ a comprehensive written liquidity risk management policy that systematically requires the bank to reduce liquidity risk  and develop  adopt  and forward to the occ a written enterprise risk management program that is designed to ensure that the bank effectively identifies  monitors  and controls its enterprise wide risks  including by developing risk limits for each line of business 
the bank has submitted or will submit these plans  policies and procedures to the occ for a written determination that the occ has no supervisory objection to them 
upon the bank receipt of no supervisory objection from the occ  the consent order requires the bank to implement and ensure adherence to the plans  policies and procedures 
while subject to the consent order  the bank management and board of directors will be required to focus a substantial amount of time on complying with its terms  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
there is also no guarantee that the bank will be able to fully comply with the consent order 
in the event the bank is in material non compliance with the terms of the consent order  the occ has the authority to subject the bank to additional corrective actions 
in particular  if the bank fails to submit a written capital plan within a time period acceptable to the occ  or fails to implement a written capital plan for which the occ has provided a written determination of no supervisory objection  then at the sole discretion of the occ  the bank may be deemed undercapitalized for purposes of the consent order 
if the occ determines that the bank is undercapitalized for purposes of the consent order  it may at its discretion impose additional certain corrective actions on the bank operations that are applicable to undercapitalized institutions 
these corrective actions could negatively impact the bank operations and financial performance 
we remain subject to the restrictions and conditions of the supervisory agreement 
failure to comply with the supervisory agreement could result in further enforcement action against us  which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we remain subject to the supervisory agreement  which requires that we take certain actions to address issues identified by the ots 
the supervisory agreement is enforced by the federal reserve as a successor regulator to the ots 
while we believe that we have taken numerous steps to comply with  and intend to comply in the future with  the requirements of the supervisory agreement  failure to comply with the supervisory agreement in the time frames provided  or at all  could result in additional enforcement orders or penalties from our regulators  which could include further restrictions on us  assessment of civil money penalties on us  as well as our directors  officers and other affiliated parties and removal of one or more officers and or directors 
such actions  if initiated  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 
financial services reform legislation has resulted in  among other things  numerous restrictions and requirements which could negatively impact our business and increase our costs of operations 
the dodd frank act was signed into law on july  and has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and affected the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
as a result  various federal agencies were required to adopt a broad range of new implementation rules and regulations and are given significant discretion in drafting the implementation rules and regulations 
consequently  it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of dodd frank act on us or the bank  including the extent to which it could increase costs or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner  or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
nor can we predict the impact or substance of other future legislation or regulation 
however  it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and potentially our interest expense 
moreover  the dodd frank act did not address reform of the gses 
while options for the reform of the gses have been released no specific reform proposal has been enacted 
the results of any such reform  and its effect on us  are difficult to predict and may result in unintended consequences 
increases in deposit insurance premiums and special fdic assessments will adversely affect our earnings 
since late  the economic environment has caused higher levels of bank failures  which dramatically increased fdic resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the dif 
as a result  we were required to pay higher deposit insurance premiums and special assessments that adversely affect our earnings 
in addition  the dodd frank act required the fdic to substantially revise its regulations for determining the amount of an institution deposit insurance premiums 
the dodd frank act also made changes  among other things  to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif  increasing the minimum from percent to percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits  and eliminating the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to financial institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
the fdic has established a higher reserve ratio of as a long term goal beyond what is required by statute 
effective april   the fdic implemented a new assessment rate schedule  which included changing the deposit insurance assessment base to an amount equal to the insured institution average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity and requiring the use of a scorecard that combines camels ratings with certain forward looking information 
these changes resulted in increases to our fdic deposit insurance premiums  and we could be subject to higher deposit insurance premiums and special assessments in the future that could adversely affect our earnings 
we are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny with respect to bank secrecy and anti money laundering statutes and regulations 
in recent years  regulators have intensified their focus on bank secrecy and anti money laundering  statutes  regulations and compliance requirements  as well as compliance with the rules enforced by ofac  and we have been required to revise policies and procedures and install new systems in order to comply with regulations  guidelines and examination procedures in this area 
more recently  the bank agreed in the consent order to review and revise the bank bank secrecy and anti money laundering risk assessment and written program of policies and procedures adopted in accordance with the bank secrecy act and update the status of the bank plan and timeline for the implementation of enhanced bank secrecy and anti money laundering internal controls 
we cannot be certain that the policies  procedures and systems we have in place or may in the future put in place are or will be successful 
therefore  there is no assurance that in every instance we are and will be in full compliance with these requirements or the consent order 
we may incur fines  penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations  possibly even for inadvertent or unintentional violations 
we maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations 
however  some legal and regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance 
for example  we are subject to regulations issued by ofac that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries 
ofac may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations 
there may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance  including restrictions on certain activities 
such a finding may also damage our reputation as described below and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities 
the impact of the new basel iii capital standards is uncertain 
in december  the basel committee issued its framework for strengthening capital and liquidity requirements together  basel iii 
basel iii imposes  if implemented by us bank regulatory agencies  new minimum capital requirements on banking institutions  as well as a capital conservation buffer and  if applicable  a countercyclical capital buffer that can be used by banks to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress 
in addition  basel iii limits the inclusion of msrs and deferred tax assets to percent of common equity tier as defined in the basel iii final framework  cet  individually  and percent of cet  in the aggregate 
our msrs and deferred tax assets currently significantly exceed the limit  and there is no assurance that they will be includable in cet in the future 
basel iii also proposes minimum liquidity measures 
in june  the us bank regulatory agencies requested comment on three sets of proposed rules that implement the basel iii capital framework and also make other changes to us regulatory capital standards for banking institutions  which rules were to become effective under a phase in period beginning january  however  the us bank regulatory agencies announced on november  that the implementations of the proposed basel iii rules would be delayed 
in addition  the basel committee is considering further amendments to basel iii 
accordingly  the regulations ultimately applicable to us may be substantially different from the basel iii final framework as published in december and the rules proposed by the us bank regulatory agencies in june  but may result in higher capital and liquidity requirements which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to resume making future payments of dividends on our capital stock and interest on trust preferred securities 
in early  we provided notice to the us treasury exercising our contractual right to defer our regularly scheduled quarterly payments of dividends  beginning with the february payment  on preferred stock issued and outstanding in connection with our participation in the tarp capital purchase program 
we also exercised our contractual right to defer interest payments with respect to our trust preferred securities 
as a result of such deferrals  we are prohibited from making dividend payments on our capital stock  because the terms of the preferred stock and the trust preferred securities prohibit dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of certain equity securities until all accrued and unpaid dividends and interest are paid  subject to limited exceptions 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to resume making these dividend and interest payments in the future  and our inability to do so after a number of quarters may cause us to default on those obligations 
in addition  our ability to make dividend payments is subject to the limitations set forth in the supervisory agreement  which provides that we must receive the prior written non objection of the federal reserve in order to pay dividends  and to the receipt of dividends from the bank  which are restricted by the consent order 
also  under michigan law  we are prohibited from paying dividends on our capital stock if  after giving effect to the dividend  i we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or ii our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders with preferential rights on dissolution which are superior to those receiving the dividend 
operational risk we have restructured our executive team  and our ability to execute our revised business strategy may not prove successful 
many of our executive officers are serving in new capacities  and several of our directors have been appointed to the board of directors for a relatively short period of time 
since the restructuring  which began on october  and continued through the fourth quarter  the executive team has devoted substantial efforts to significantly change our business strategy and operational activities 
there is no assurance that these efforts will prove successful or that the executive team will be able to successfully execute upon the revised business strategy and operational activities 
we depend on our institutional counterparties to provide services that are critical to our business 
if one or more of our institutional counterparties defaults on its obligations to us or becomes insolvent  it could have a material adverse affect on our earnings  liquidity  capital position and financial condition 
we face the risk that one or more of our institutional counterparties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations to us 
we believe that our primary exposures to institutional counterparty risk are with third party providers of credit enhancement on the mortgage assets that we hold in our investment portfolio  including mortgage insurers and financial guarantors  issuers of securities held on our consolidated statements of financial condition  and derivatives counterparties 
counterparty risk can also adversely affect our ability to acquire  sell or hold msrs in the future 
for example  because msrs are a contractual right  we may be required to sell the msrs to counterparties 
the challenging mortgage and credit market conditions have adversely affected  and will likely continue to adversely affect  the liquidity and financial condition of a number of our institutional counterparties  particularly those whose businesses are concentrated in the mortgage industry 
one or more of these institutions may default in its obligations to us for a number of reasons  such as changes in financial condition that affect their credit ratings  a reduction in liquidity  operational failures or insolvency 
several of our institutional counterparties have experienced economic hardships and liquidity constraints 
these and other key institutional counterparties may become subject to serious liquidity problems that  either temporarily or permanently  negatively affect the viability of their business plans or reduce their access to funding sources 
the financial difficulties that a number of our institutional counterparties are currently experiencing may negatively affect the ability of these counterparties to meet their obligations to us and the amount or quality of the products or services they provide to us 
a default by a counterparty with significant obligations to us could result in significant financial losses to us and could have a material adverse effect our ability to conduct our operations  which would adversely affect our earnings  liquidity  capital position and financial condition 
in addition  a default by a counterparty may require us to obtain a substitute counterparty which may not exist in this economic climate and which may  as a result  cause us to default on our related financial obligations 
current and further deterioration in the housing market  as well as the number of programs that have been introduced to address the situation by government agencies and government sponsored enterprises  may lead to increased costs to service loans which could affect our margins or impair the value of our msrs 
the housing and the residential mortgage markets have experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions 
in response  federal and state government  as well as the gses  have developed a number of programs and instituted a number of requirements on servicers in an effort to limit foreclosures and  in the case of the gses  to minimize losses on loans that they guarantee or own 
these additional programs and requirements may increase operating expenses or otherwise change the costs associated with servicing loans for others  which may result in lower margins or impairment in the expected value of our msrs 
we may be terminated as a servicer or master servicer  be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan  or incur costs  liabilities  fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations  including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions 
we act as servicer for mortgage loans owned by third parties 
as a servicer for those loans we have certain contractual obligations  including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or  to the extent applicable  considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales 
if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer  we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice  causing us to lose servicing income 
for certain investors and or certain transactions  we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan 
if we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did not satisfy our obligations as a servicer  or increased loss severity on such repurchases  we may have a significant reduction to net servicing income within our mortgage banking noninterest income 
we may incur costs if we are required to  or if we elect to  re execute or re file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures 
we may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower 
if a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process  we may have liability to the borrower and or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the required process was not followed 
these costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us 
in addition  if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective  we could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan 
we may incur liability to securitization investors relating to delays or deficiencies in our processing of mortgage assignments or other documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosures 
the fair value of our msrs may be negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure costs 
we may be subject to fines and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our foreclosure practices or in the foreclosure practices of other mortgage loan servicers 
any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our home lending or servicing business 
we use estimates in determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities  which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines or increases in valuation 
a portion of our assets and liabilities are carried on our consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value  including our msrs  certain mortgage loans held for sale  trading assets  available for sale securities  derivatives  the future obligations arising from our settlement with the doj  and transferors interests  or the beneficial interests in the heloc securitization trusts that we receive in exchange for the funds we are obligated to advance to pay for subsequent additional draws on the lines of credit during a rapid amortization period 
generally  for assets that are reported at fair value  we use quoted market prices  when available or internal valuation models that utilize observable market data inputs to estimate their fair value 
in certain cases  observable market prices and data may not be readily available or their availability may be diminished due to market conditions 
we use financial models to value certain of these assets and liabilities 
these models are complex and use asset specific collateral data and market inputs for interest rates 
we cannot assure you that the models or the underlying assumptions will prove to be predictive and remain so over time  and therefore  actual results may differ from our models 
any assumptions we use are complex as we must make judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and actual experience may differ from our assumptions 
different assumptions could result in significant declines in valuation  which in turn could result in significant declines or increases in the dollar amount of assets or increases in the liabilities we report on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances  which could harm liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
when mortgage loans are sold  whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization  we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers  guarantors and insurers  including the gses  about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated 
whole loan sale agreements require repurchase or substitute mortgage loans  or indemnify buyers against losses  in the event we breach these representations or warranties 
in addition  we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan 
with respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels  the remedies available against the originating broker or correspondent  if any  may not be as broad as the remedies available to a purchasers  guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us 
in addition  we also face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent  if any  may not have financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available 
therefore  if a purchaser  guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us  we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent 
if repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims  the liquidity  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our representation and warranty reserve for losses could be insufficient 
we currently maintain a representation and warranty reserve  formerly known as the secondary market reserve  which is a liability on the consolidated statements of financial condition  to reflect best estimate of expected losses that have been incurred on loans that we have sold or securitized into the secondary market  including to the securitized trusts in our private label securitizations and must subsequently repurchase or with respect to which we must indemnify the purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties 
our representation and warranty reserve takes into account both our estimate of expected losses on loans sold during the current accounting period  as well as adjustments to our previous estimates of expected losses on loans sold  and may  based upon a number of factors  include the recent decision in our litigation with assured 
in addition  the occ  as part of its supervisory function  periodically reviews our representation and warranty reserve 
the occ may require us to increase our representation and warranty reserve or to recognize further losses  based on its judgment  which may be different from that of our management 
the results of such reviews could have an effect on the bank s reserves 
in each case  these estimates are based on our most recent data regarding loan repurchases  and actual credit losses on repurchased loans 
we also make increases to the representation and warranty reserve based on current loan sales which reduces our net gain on loan sales 
adjustments to our previous estimates are recorded as an increase or decrease in our representation and warranty reserve change in estimate 
both the assumptions and estimates used could be inaccurate  resulting in a level of reserve that is less than actual losses 
if additional reserves are required  it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our mortgage banking profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to originate and resell a high volume of mortgage loans 
mortgage production  especially refinancing activity  declines in rising interest rate environments 
while we have been experiencing historically low interest rates  the low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely 
when interest rates increase  there can be no assurance that our mortgage production will continue at current levels 
because we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate  the profitability of our mortgage banking segment depends in large part upon our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain 
thus  in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment  we are dependent upon i the existence of an active secondary market and ii our ability to profitably sell loans or securities into that market 
if our level of mortgage production declines  the profitability will depend upon our ability to reduce our costs commensurate with the reduction of revenue from our mortgage operations 
our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single family mortgage loans  which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by the gses and other institutional and non institutional investors 
these entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans 
because the largest participants in the secondary market are government sponsored enterprises whose activities are governed by federal law  any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of the gses could  in turn  adversely affect our operations 
in september  the gses were placed into conservatorship by the us government 
although to date  the conservatorship has not had a significant or adverse effect on our operations  it is currently unclear whether further changes would significantly and adversely affect our operations 
the government and others have provided options to reform the gses  but the results of any such reform  and their impact on us  are difficult to predict 
to date  no reform proposal has been enacted 
in addition  our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by the gses and other institutional and non institutional investors 
our ability to remain eligible to originate and securitize government insured loans may also depend on having an acceptable peer relative delinquency ratio for fha loans and maintaining a delinquency rate with respect to ginnie mae pools that are below ginnie mae guidelines 
in the case of ginnie mae pools  the bank has repurchased past due loans to maintain compliance with the minimum required delinquency ratios 
although these loans are typically insured as to principal by fha  such repurchases increase our liquidity needs  and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity to continue to purchase such loans out of the ginnie mae pools 
in addition  due to our unilateral ability to repurchase such loans out of the ginnie mae pools  we are required to account for them on our balance sheet whether or not we choose to repurchase them  which could adversely affect our capital ratios 
any significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the gses could materially and adversely affect our operations 
further  the criteria for loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time to time by the sponsoring entity which could result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations 
the profitability of participating in specific programs may vary depending on a number of factors  including our administrative costs of originating and purchasing qualifying loans and our costs of meeting such criteria 
we are a holding company and therefore dependent on the bank for funding of obligations and dividends 
as a holding company without significant assets other than the capital stock of the bank  our ability to service our debt or preferred stock obligations  including interest payments on debentures underlying the trust preferred securities  and dividend payments on the preferred stock we issued to the us treasury  is dependent upon available cash on hand and the receipt of dividends from the bank on such capital stock 
the declaration and payment of dividends by the bank on all classes of its capital stock is subject to the discretion of the bank board of directors and to applicable regulatory and legal limitations  including the prior written non objection of the occ as a result of the consent order 
if the bank does not make dividend payments to us  we may not be able to service our debt or preferred stock obligations  which could have a material adverse effect of our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the federal reserve has the authority  and under certain circumstances the duty  to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the holding companies they supervise  including us 
we may be exposed to other operational  legal and reputational risks 
we are exposed to many types of operational risk  including reputational risk  legal and compliance risk  the risk of fraud or theft by employees  disputes with employees and contractors  customers or outsiders  litigation  unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors 
negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in activities  such as lending practices  data security  corporate governance and foreclosure practices  or our involvement in government programs  such as the tarp capital purchase program  and may damage our reputation 
additionally  actions taken by government regulators and community organizations may also damage our reputation 
this negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action which  in turn  could increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions  fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses 
for example  current public opinion regarding defects in the foreclosure practices of financial institutions may lead to an increased risk of consumer litigation  uncertainty of title  a depressed market for non performing assets and indemnification risk from our counterparties  including the gses 
our dependence upon automated systems to record and process our transaction volume poses the risk that technical system flaws  poor implementation of systems or employee errors or tampering or manipulation of those systems could result in losses and may be difficult to detect 
we may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are beyond our control for example  computer viruses  electrical or telecommunications outages 
we are further exposed to the risk that our third party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors as we are 
these disruptions may interfere with service to our customers and result in a financial loss or liability 
a disproportionate impact could be experienced from continued adverse economic conditions because our loans are geographically concentrated in only a few states 
a significant portion of our mortgage loan portfolio is geographically concentrated in certain states  including california  michigan  florida  washington and arizona  which collectively represent approximately percent of mortgage loans held for investment balance at december  in addition  percent of commercial real estate loans held for investment are in michigan at december  continued adverse economic conditions in these markets could cause delinquencies and charge offs of these loans to increase  likely resulting in a corresponding and disproportionately large decline in revenues and demand for our services and an increase in credit risk and the value of collateral for our loans to decline  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans 
we may incur additional costs and expenses relating to foreclosure procedures 
officials in states and the district of columbia have announced a joint investigation of the procedures followed by banks and mortgage companies in connection with completing affidavits relating to home foreclosures  specifically with respect to i whether the persons signing such affidavits had the requisite personal knowledge to sign the affidavits and ii compliance with notarization requirements 
although we are continuing to review  there are a number of structural differences between our business model and the resulting practices and those of the larger servicers that have been publicized in the media 
for example  we do not engage in the practice of bulk purchases of loans from other servicers or investors  nor have engaged in any acquisitions that typically result in multiple servicing locations and integration issues from both a processing and personnel standpoint 
as a result  we are not required to service seasoned loans following a transfer and all of the servicing functions are performed in one location and on one core operating system 
in addition  we sell servicing rights with some regularity and the sale of servicing rights has allowed for a more reasonable volume of loans that staff has to manage 
despite these structural differences  we expect to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with foreclosure procedures 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will not incur additional costs and expenses as a result of legislative  administrative or regulatory investigations or actions relating to foreclosure procedures 
we could  as a result of a stock offering or future trading activity in our common or preferred stock  experience an ownership change for tax purposes that could cause us to permanently lose a portion of us federal deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  our net deferred tax assets were approximately million and million  respectively  which includes both federal and state operating losses 
these net deferred tax assets were fully offset by valuation allowances of the same amounts 
as of december   our federal net operating loss carry forwards totaled approximately million 
our ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income will be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change as defined for us federal income tax purposes 
mp thrift  our controlling stockholder  held approximately percent of common stock as of december  as a result of mp thrift ownership  issuances or sales of common stock or other securities in the future or certain other direct or indirect changes in ownership  could result in an ownership change under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
section of the code imposes restrictions on the use of a corporation s net operating losses  certain recognized built in losses  and other carryovers after an ownership change occurs 
an ownership change is generally a greater than percentage point increase by certain five percent shareholders during the testing period  which is generally the three year period ending on the transaction date 
upon an ownership change  a corporation generally is subject to an annual limitation on its prechange losses and certain recognized built in losses equal to the value of the corporation s market capitalization immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate subject to certain adjustments 
the annual limitation is increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year 
since us federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for up to years  the annual limitation also effectively provides a cap on the cumulative amount of prechange losses and certain recognized built in losses that may be utilized 
prechange losses and certain recognized built in losses in excess of the cap are effectively lost 
the relevant calculations under section of the code are technical and highly complex 
any stock offering  combined with other ownership changes  could cause us to experience an ownership change 
if an ownership change were to occur  we believe it could cause us to permanently lose the ability to realize a portion of our deferred tax asset  resulting in reduction to total shareholders equity 
even if there is an ownership change  and part or all of our deferred tax assets would be limited  our obligations under the terms of the doj agreement would not be relieved 
moreover  if we or the bank are party to a business transaction so large that it causes the deferred tax asset to be completely eliminated  then months following the transaction we  or our successor  are required to begin making the additional payments required under the doj agreement  for more information see item business 
we may be subject to additional risks as we enter new lines of business or introduce new products and services 
from time to time  we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts  particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed 
in developing and marketing new lines of business and or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives  and shifting market preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
furthermore  any new line of business and or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
general risk factors our potential loss of key members of senior management or our inability to attract and retain qualified relationship managers in the future could affect our ability to operate effectively 
we depend on the services of existing senior management to carry out our business and investment strategies 
as we expand and as we continue to refine and reshape our business model  we will need to continue to attract and retain additional senior management and recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel that leave our employ 
in addition  as we continue to grow our business and plan to continue to expand our locations  products and services  we will need to continue to attract and retain qualified banking personnel 
competition for such personnel is especially keen in our geographic market areas and competition for the best people in most businesses in which we engage can be intense 
in addition  so long as our preferred stock that was issued as part of tarp is held by the us treasury  arra limits the amount of incentive compensation that can be paid to certain executives 
the effect could be to limit our ability to attract and retain senior management in the future 
if we are unable to attract and retain talented people  our business could suffer 
the loss of the services of any senior management personnel  and  in particular  the loss for any reason  including death or disability of our chairman and chief executive officer or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us 
our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us 
we have established processes and procedures intended to identify  measure  monitor  report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject  including liquidity risk  credit risk  market risk  interest rate risk  operational risk  legal and compliance risk  and reputational risk  among others 
although we have made  and continue to make  material changes to our risk management framework  in part due to guidance provided by our regulators and consultants  there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist  or develop in the future  risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified 
if our risk management framework proves ineffective  we could suffer unexpected losses which could have a materially adversely effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
our network and computer systems on which we depend could fail  experience an interruption  or experience a breach in security 
our computer systems could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
because we conduct part of our business over the internet and outsource several critical functions to third parties  our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers  to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  physical break ins or similar catastrophic events 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a significant barrier to online financial transactions is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
our internet banking system relies on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms our third party service providers use to protect customer transaction data 
if any such compromise of security were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
market acceptance of internet banking depends substantially on widespread adoption of the internet for general commercial and financial services transactions 
if another provider of commercial services through the internet were to suffer damage from physical break in  security breach or other disruptive problems caused by the internet or other users  the growth and public acceptance of the internet for commercial transactions could suffer 
this type of event could deter our potential customers or cause customers to leave us and thereby materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date we have not experienced any material incidents relating to cyber security or other forms of information security breaches  although there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future given the rapidly expanding and evolving cybersecurity threats that exists today 
this is especially true because techniques used tend to change frequently or would not be recognized until launched  and attacks can originate from a wide array of sources  including unrelated third parties 
these risks may increase in the future given our increased emphasis on internet based products and services  including mobile banking and mobile payments 
as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve  we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or refine our protective measures against these threats 
we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
in addition  such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
general business  economic and political conditions may significantly affect our earnings 
our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the united states 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  recession  unemployment  real estate values  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  and the strength of the us economy  as well as the local economies in which we conduct business 
if any of these conditions worsen  our business and earnings could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household incomes could decrease the demand for our home loans and increase the number of customers who become past due or default on their loans  or  a rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans 
in addition  our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
we are particularly affected by the policies of the federal reserve  which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states  and the perception of those policies by the financial markets 
the federal reserve s policies influence both the financial markets and the size and liquidity of the mortgage origination market  which significantly impacts the earnings of our mortgage lending operation and the value of our investment in msrs and other retained interests 
the federal reserve s policies and perceptions of those policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
changes in those policies or perceptions are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are a controlled company that is exempt from certain nyse corporate governance requirements 
our common stock is currently listed on the nyse 
the nyse generally requires a majority of directors to be independent and requires audit  compensation and nominating committees to be composed solely of independent directors 
however  under the rules applicable to the nyse  if another company owns more than percent of the voting power of a listed company  that company is considered a controlled company and exempt from rules relating to independence of the board of directors and the compensation and nominating committees 
we are a controlled company because mp thrift beneficially owns more than percent of our outstanding voting stock 
a majority of the directors on the compensation and nominating committees are affiliated with mp thrift 
mp thrift has the right  if exercised  to designate a majority of the directors on the board of directors 
our stockholders do not have  and may never have  all the protections that these rules are intended to provide 
if we become unable to continue to be deemed a controlled company  we would be required to meet these independence requirements and  if we are not able to do so  our common stock could be delisted from the nyse 
our controlling stockholder has significant influence over us  including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders  whether or not such decisions are in the best interests of other stockholders 
mp thrift beneficially owns a substantial majority of our outstanding common stock and as a result  has control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and also the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of our board of directors or the stockholders regardless of whether or not other members of our board of directors or stockholders believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests 
so long as mp thrift continues to hold a majority of our outstanding common stock  it will have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors and other matters being voted on  and continue to exert significant influence over us 
changes in accounting standards may impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may from time to time experience weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that can affect our recording and reporting of financial information 
in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in a restatement of prior period financial statements 
for example  on december   the fasb issued for public comment a proposed accounting standards update  financial instruments credit losses subtopic  that would substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks  financial institutions and other organizations 
the proposal would remove the existing probable threshold in us gaap for recognizing credit losses and instead require affected reporting companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses on financial assets over the lifetime of each such asset  broadening the range of information that must be considered in measuring the allowance for expected credit losses 
this proposal  if adopted as proposed  will likely have a negative impact  potentially material  on our reported earnings and capital and could also have an impact on our lending to the extent that higher reserves are required at the inception of a loan 
we are subject to a number of legal or regulatory proceedings which can be complicated and slow moving  thus making them difficult to predict 
at any given time  we are defending ourselves against a number of legal and regulatory proceedings 
proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions  business improvement orders  or other results adverse to us  which could materially and negatively affect our businesses  financial condition  results of operations  and may require material changes in our business  or cause us reputational harm 
moreover  claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop  thus making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process 
for example  assured filed a lawsuit against the bank in april  the court issued a decision in february  and the bank plans to appeal the decision 
notwithstanding the bank intention to vigorously contest the decision on appeal and the expected lengthy duration of the appeal process  we decided in light of the court decision to make an immediate  material increase in our accrual for pending and threatened litigation  which includes amounts for assured  the litigation with mbia  which raises legal and factual issues that are similar to assured  and other pending and threatened litigation 
as a participant in the financial services industry  it is likely that we will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations relating to our business and operations 
the results of these legal and regulatory proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties  restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business  or reputational harm 
although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss 
in addition  due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings  amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question 
thus  our ultimate losses may be higher  and possibly significantly so  than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies 
for a further discussion of the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe some of our pending legal proceedings  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in
