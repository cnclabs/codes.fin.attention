table of contents item business company overview corporate vision to become a recognized leader in the advancement of women s health by providing innovative methods to detect  monitor and manage the treatment of gynecologic cancers and other related diseases corporate mission we will develop and commercialize high value multi marker diagnostic tests which address unmet needs in gynecologic oncology and women s health 
we will accomplish our mission through internal development  targeted acquisitions  and collaborations with leading scientific and clinical institutions 
our commercial efforts will include direct marketing and sales activities as well as partnerships with leading companies in women s health 
mission statement we are dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of novel high value diagnostic tests that help physicians diagnose  treat and improve outcomes for patients 
our tests are intended to detect  diagnose and stage disease  and to help guide decisions regarding patient prognosis and treatment 
these may include decisions to refer patients to specialists  to perform additional testing  or to assist in the selection or monitoring of therapy and disease progression 
a distinctive feature of our approach is to combine multiple biomarkers into a single  reportable index score that has higher diagnostic effectiveness than its constituents 
we concentrate our development of novel diagnostic tests in the fields of gynecologic oncology and women s health  with the initial focus on ovarian cancer 
we also intend to address clinical unmet needs related to early disease detection  treatment response  monitoring of disease progression  prognosis and others through collaborations with leading academic and clinical research institutions 
our lead product  ova  an ovarian cancer blood test was cleared by the united states food and drug administration fda on september  ova addresses a clear unmet clinical need  namely the pre surgical identification of women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor 
numerous studies have documented the benefit of referral of these women to gynecologic oncologists for their initial surgery 
prior to the clearance of ova  no blood test had been cleared by the fda for physicians to use in the pre surgical management of ovarian adnexal masses 
ova is a qualitative serum test that utilizes five well established biomarkers and proprietary fda cleared software to determine the likelihood of malignancy in women over age  with a pelvic mass for whom surgery is planned 
ova was developed through large clinical studies in collaboration with numerous academic medical centers encompassing over  clinical samples 
ova was fully validated in a prospective multi center clinical trial encompassing sites reflective of the diverse nature of the clinical centers at which ovarian adnexal masses are evaluated 
the results of the clinical trial demonstrated that in a clinical cohort of patients  ova  in conjunction with clinical evaluation  was able to identify of the malignant ovarian tumors overall  and to rule out malignancy with a negative predictive value npv of 
at the international gynecologic cancer society meeting  data were presented demonstrating the high sensitivity of ova for epithelial ovarian cancers  ova detected epithelial ovarian cancer cases for a sensitivity of  including stage i and stage ii epithelial ovarian cancers  for an overall sensitivity of for early stage epithelial ovarian cancers  as compared to for ca using the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog cutoffs 
the improvement in sensitivity was even greater among premenopausal women  for ova  sensitivity for early stage epithelial ovarian cancer was and for ca  sensitivity was 
overall  ova detected of malignancies missed by ca  including all advanced stage malignancies 
ova is not indicated for use as a screening or stand alone diagnostic assay 

table of contents in  we completed a second pivotal clinical study of ova  called the ova study and led by dr 
robert e 
bristow  director of gynecologic oncology services with uc irvine healthcare 
the study evaluated ova performance in a population of patients who underwent surgery for an adnexal mass after enrollment by a non gynecologic oncologist  the intended use population for routine ova testing 
in the new study  of the sites used in each study  only were common to both 
collectively  the two studies evaluated  eligible subjects at a total of sites 
despite the difference in population between the two studies  and the large number of differing sites  the sensitivity of ova added to clinical impression also called ova dual assessment was identical  at 
in addition  overall npv of ova dual assessment was  higher than the npv found in the earlier validation study 
in premenopausal surgery patients  ova dual assessment sensitivity was  npv was and specificity was when combined with clinical assessment 
ova also showed strong performance in detecting early stage malignancies 
ova correctly stratified of early stage cancers and of stage i cancers as high risk  respectively 
in comparison  ca ii sensitivity was for early stage and for stage i malignancies 
overall  the results strongly and independently confirmed the clinical performance of ova in presurgical triage of adnexal mass patients  including premenopausal and early stage cancers 
the ova study was recently published in the peer reviewed journal gynecologic oncology  which enjoys the highest impact factor rating of any journal worldwide focused on gynecologic oncology 
the results have also been incorporated into an updated medical education presentation  as well as our marketing and reimbursement collateral 
since many professional medical societies stress the importance of multiple independent clinical trials as so called evidence levels  we also believe that ova contributes to a higher evidence level relative to ova s utility in the medical management of adnexal masses 
in addition to ova  we have development programs in other clinical aspects of ovarian cancer as well as in peripheral arterial disease 
in the field of peripheral arterial disease  we have identified candidate biomarkers that may help to identify individuals at high risk for a decreased ankle brachial index score  which is indicative of the likely presence of peripheral arterial disease 
we have completed an intended use study  published in the december edition of vascular medicine  to develop and validate a multi marker algorithm for the assessment of individuals at risk for peripheral arterial disease 
this algorithm will be specifically directed at a primary care population in which the peripheral arterial disease blood test is expected to be used 
with our recent decision to focus on gynecologic oncology and related diseases  we now plan to seek a development commercial partner for this program who will work with us to complete the product development  conduct the required clinical validation studies  and eventually commercialize this product on a global basis 
in another program  we have also initiated pilot experiments intended to identify markers with high clinical specificity that may complement ova these experiments are early stage and may take different directions depending on the results 
we have yet to select one or more intended uses  and establish a regulatory pathway for this potential next generation ova product 
current and former academic and research institutions that we have or have had collaborations with include the johns hopkins university school of medicine jhu  the university of texas md anderson cancer center md anderson  university college london ucl  the university of texas medical branch utmb  the katholieke universiteit leuven  clinic of gynecology and clinic of oncology  rigshospitalet  copenhagen university hospital rigshospitalet  the ohio state university research foundation osu  stanford university stanford  and the university of kentucky uk 

table of contents we have a strategic alliance agreement the strategic alliance agreement with quest diagnostics to develop and commercialize up to three diagnostic tests from our product pipeline the strategic alliance 
quest diagnostics has the exclusive right to commercialize ova in the clinical laboratory market until september  with an option to extend such exclusive period in its sole discretion for one additional year 
prior to the expiration of the strategic alliance in october  quest diagnostics selected two diagnostic tests to commercialize  a peripheral arterial disease blood test and ova we were originally incorporated in california on december   under the name abiotic systems 
in march  we changed our corporate name to ciphergen biosystems  inc and in may  we reincorporated in delaware 
we had our initial public offering in september on november   we sold assets and liabilities of our protein research tools and collaborative services business the instrument business sale  to bio rad laboratories  inc bio rad  in order to concentrate our resources on developing clinical protein biomarker diagnostic products and services 
on august   we changed our corporate name to vermillion  inc on march   we filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the bankruptcy court 
subsequently  on january   the confirmation order issued by the bankruptcy court approving our second amended plan of reorganization under chapter dated january  became final and all conditions precedent to january  were satisfied or waived 
accordingly  we emerged from bankruptcy protection under chapter on january  our bankruptcy case was formally closed on january  ova was launched on march  by quest diagnostics under the terms of the strategic alliance agreement 
on march   the medicare contractor highmark medicare services announced that it would cover ova in its reimbursement program 
on september   we announced that ova was ce marked  a requirement for marketing the test in the european union 
ova has satisfied all certification requirements to complete its declaration of conformity 
in november  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with correlogic systems  inc correlogic  pursuant to which we paid to correlogic  and purchased from correlogic substantially all of its assets  including certain documents  diagnostic samples and intellectual property owned by correlogic in connection with correlogic s ovarian cancer diagnostics business  including a diagnostic test under the name ovacheck for the detection of ovarian cancer the acquisition 
correlogic was in chapter proceedings in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland the court at the time the asset purchase agreement was entered into and the acquisition was subject to court approval 
court approval was received and the acquisition completed in december we plan to use the correlogic assets purchased from the acquisition to advance the goals of our ovarian cancer franchise  including the development of the next generation ova product 
the diagnostic market the economics of healthcare demand improved allocation of resources which can be derived through disease prevention  early detection of disease leading to early intervention  and diagnostic tools that can triage patients to more appropriate therapy and intervention 
according to the may in vitro diagnostics market analysis report  the worldwide market for in vitro diagnostics ivds in was approximately billion 
visiongain  an independent business information provider  predicts that the market will generate nearly billion in we have chosen to concentrate primarily in the areas of oncology and women s health 
demographic trends suggest that  as the population ages  the burden from these diseases will increase and the demand for quality diagnostic  prognostic and predictive tests will increase 
in addition  these areas generally lack quality diagnostic tests and  therefore  we believe patient outcomes can be significantly improved by the development of novel diagnostic tests 
our focus on translational biomarkers enables us to address the market for novel diagnostic tests that simultaneously measure multiple biomarkers 
a biomarker is a biomolecule or variant biomolecule that is present 
table of contents at measurably greater or lesser concentrations in a disease state versus a normal condition 
conventional protein tests measure a single protein biomarker whereas most diseases are complex 
we believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level ie  most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies and at the human response level ie  each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner 
consequently  measuring a single biomarker when multiple biomarkers may be altered in a complex disease is unlikely to provide meaningful information about the disease state 
we believe that our approach of monitoring and combining multiple protein biomarkers using a variety of analytical techniques will allow us to create diagnostic tests with sufficient sensitivity and specificity about the disease state to aid the physician considering treatment options for patients with complex diseases 
such assays are commonly referred to as ivdmia in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays  and often utilize advanced algorithms based on logistic regression  pattern recognition and the like 
often  ivdmia algorithms are non intuitive  and therefore require rigorous clinical validation and error modeling 
vermillion and its collaborators are expert in these areas  and in the case of ova  presented both the clinical validation and error modeling in order to gain k clearance of ova  as an ivd software device 
ovarian cancer background 
commonly known as the silent killer  ovarian cancer leads to approximately  deaths each year in the united states 
the american cancer society acs estimates that over  new ovarian cancer cases will be diagnosed in  with the majority of the patients in the late stages of the disease in which the cancer has spread beyond the ovary 
unfortunately  ovarian cancer patients in the late stages of the disease have a poor prognosis  which leads to the high mortality rates 
according to the acs  when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at its earliest stage  the patient has a year survival rate of 
ovarian cancer patients have up to a cure rate following surgery and or chemotherapy if detected in stage however  only of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed before the tumor has spread outside the ovary 
for ovarian cancer patients diagnosed in the late stages of the disease  the year survival rate falls to as low as while the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in its earliest stages greatly increases the likelihood of survival from the disease  another factor that predicts survival from ovarian cancer is the specialized training of the surgeon who operates on the ovarian cancer patient 
numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of malignant ovarian tumors by specialists such as gynecologic oncologists or at specialist medical centers improves outcomes for women with these tumors 
published guidelines from the society of gynecologic oncologists the sgo and the acog recommend referral of women with malignant ovarian tumors to specialists 
unfortunately  today  only about one third of women with these types of tumors are operated on by specialists  in part because of inadequate tests and procedures that can identify such malignancies with high sensitivity 
accordingly  an unmet clinical need is a diagnostic test that can provide adequate predictive value to stratify patients with a pelvic mass into those with a high risk of invasive ovarian cancer versus those with a low risk of ovarian cancer  which is essential for improving overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer 
although adnexal masses are relatively common  malignant tumors are less so 
screening studies have indicated that the prevalence of adnexal masses in postmenopausal women can be as high as percent 
adnexal masses are thought to be even more common in premenopausal women  but there are more non persistent  physiologic ovarian masses in this demographic 
in the prostate lung colorectal and ovarian cancer study   post menopausal women were screened for ovarian malignancy and received an abnormal ultrasound 
using the us census of million women over the age of  this suggests there are more than million adnexal masses in this segment alone 
although many of these do not present to the physician or are not concerning enough to warrant surgery  those that do require evaluation for the likelihood for malignancy could potentially benefit from the use of ova the acog and the sgo have issued guidelines to help physicians evaluate adnexal masses for malignancy 
these guidelines take into account menopausal status  ca levels  and physical and imaging findings 

table of contents however  these guidelines have notable shortcomings because of their reliance on tools with certain weaknesses 
most notably  the ca blood test  which is cleared by the fda only for monitoring for recurrence of ovarian cancer  is negative in up to of early stage ovarian cancer cases 
moreover  ca can be elevated in numerous conditions and diseases other than ovarian cancer  including benign ovarian masses and endometriosis 
these shortcomings limit the ca blood test s utility in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors or for use in detection of early stage ovarian cancer 
transvaginal ultrasound is another diagnostic modality used with patients with ovarian masses 
attempts at defining specific morphological criteria that can aid in a benign versus malignant diagnosis have led to the morphology index and the risk of malignancy index  with reports of predictive value 
however  ultrasound interpretation can be variable and dependent on the experience of the operator 
accordingly  the acog and sgo guidelines perform only modestly in identifying early stage ovarian cancer and malignancy in pre menopausal women 
efforts to improve detection of cancer by lowering the cutoff for ca the modified acog sgo guidelines provide only a modest benefit  since ca is absent in about of epithelial ovarian cancer cases and is poorly detected in early stage ovarian cancer 
clinical development 
to address this documented unmet clinical need  we initiated an ovarian cancer biomarker discovery program 
in august  we  along with collaborators at jhu  ucl and md anderson  reported in a cancer research paper the discovery of three biomarkers that  when combined with ca  provided higher diagnostic accuracy for early stage ovarian cancer than other biomarkers  including ca alone 
the three biomarkers that we reported in the august cancer research paper formed the basis of an expanded panel of biomarkers that together have demonstrated risk stratification value in a series of studies involving over  clinical samples from more than five clinical sites 
data presented at the june annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology demonstrated the portability of this biomarker panel among different clinical groups  indicating its potential validity across various testing populations 
data presented at the march annual meeting of the sgo described results from a cohort study 
we were able to demonstrate in consecutively sampled women  a significant increase in the positive predictive value using its biomarker panel over the baseline level 
this translates into the potential to enrich the concentration of ovarian cancer cases referred to the gynecologic oncologist by more than twofold 
ova ovarian tumor triage test 
in january   we commenced our multi center prospective clinical trial to demonstrate the clinical performance and utility of ova  which was developed based on the studies described above 
the clinical study population came from institutions with primary care physicians  gynecologists non go  and or gynecologic oncologists go 
the clinical study subject enrollment centers were representative of institutions where ovarian tumor subjects potentially undergo a gynecologic examination 
the specimens were collected at demographically mixed sites that included large and small medical centers universities community hospitals  clinics that specialize in women s health  small gynecology obstetrics groups  gynecology oncology practices  and hmo groups 
the performance of ova was determined based on evaluable subjects who underwent surgery to remove a documented ovarian tumor and for whom a pathology result was available 
physicians were asked  based on the information they had  which included physical  radiologic  and laboratory results  whether they believed the patient had cancer clinical assessment 
physicians were not provided with ova score in making this determination 
after surgery  the specimen was examined by a surgical pathologist per routine clinical practice 
the ability of physicians to predict malignancy without ova was compared to the ability of physicians or ova dual assessment to predict malignancy 
with dual assessment  which included ova  of cancers missed by clinician impression alone were detected 
dual assessment  which included ova  had greater sensitivity and negative predictive value than clinical assessment alone and the metrics of clinical performance were and  respectively 
we obtained fda clearance of ova on september  ova is the first fda cleared test to be used in the pre surgical evaluation of ovarian adnexal masses 
results from the clinical trial were presented at the annual meeting of the sgo 
a presentation by rachel ware miller  md  associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the university of kentucky s markey cancer center  demonstrated that the acog sgo guidelines detected only of ovarian malignancies and that the modified acog sgo guidelines improved detection to only 
moreover  detection of early 
table of contents stage ovarian cancer was only 
a second presentation by fred ueland  md  associate professor of gynecologic oncology  demonstrated that among non gynecologic oncologists  ova  in conjunction with clinical impression  improved detection of malignancy to from using clinical impression alone among patients evaluated by non gynecologic oncologists 
among these patients  detection of stage i ovarian cancer was 
additional results from the clinical trial were presented at the international gynecologic cancer society igcs meeting 
this presentation reported that ova had overall sensitivity for ovarian cancer of  as compared to for ca using cutoffs established in the acog criteria for adnexal mass evaluation and for ca using cutoffs in the modified acog criteria 
additionally  data were presented demonstrating the high sensitivity of ova for epithelial ovarian cancers  ova detected epithelial ovarian cancer cases for a sensitivity of  including stage i and stage ii epithelial ovarian cancers  for an overall sensitivity of for early stage epithelial ovarian cancers  as compared to for ca using the acog cutoffs 
the improvement in sensitivity was even greater among premenopausal women  for ova  sensitivity for early stage epithelial ovarian cancer was and for ca  sensitivity was 
overall  ova detected of malignancies missed by ca  including all advanced stage malignancies 
ova is not indicated for use as a screening or stand alone diagnostic assay 
in  we completed a second pivotal clinical study of ova  called the ova study and led by dr 
robert e 
bristow  director of gynecologic oncology services with uc irvine healthcare 
the study evaluated ova diagnostic performance in a population of evaluable patients who underwent surgery for an adnexal mass after enrollment by a non gynecologic oncologist 
like the earlier ova validation study  this was a prospective  multi center study of consecutively enrolled  eligible subjects coordinated through sites across the usa in the ova study  adnexal surgery patients were only enrolled from non gynecologic oncology caregivers 
as a result  the patient population in this study more closely resembled the intended use population for routine ova testing  women aged years or older  with an adnexal mass requiring surgery but not yet referred to gynecologic oncologist  and in which the mass was determined to be benign or malignant after enrollment 
moreover  of the sites used in each study  only were common to both 
so collectively  the two studies evaluated  eligible subjects at a total of sites 
despite the difference in population between the two studies  and the large number of differing sites  the sensitivity of ova added to clinical impression also called ova dual assessment was identical  at 
interestingly  the overall prevalence of malignancy was lower in the ova study than the previously found in the earlier ova validation study 
cancer prevalence in ova was overall and just in premenopausal surgery patients 
this difference may be explained by the exclusion of subjects enrolled by gynecologic oncologist  a potentially malignancy enriched subset of all adnexal mass surgeries 
even so  ova sensitivity was in premenopausal subjects  with or without clinical assessment 
npv is another critical element of ova performance in the context of a referral or triage test 
in ova  overall npv of ova dual assessment was  higher than the npv found in the earlier validation study 
in premenopausal subjects  where functional ovarian cysts are more common and gynecologists may elect to operate more frequently  the npv of ova with or without clinical assessment was 
in contrast  clinical assessment predicted just of malignancies overall  and only of premenopausal malignancies 
together  the differential sensitivity and high npv of ova strongly confirmed previous findings  supporting the evidence of clinical utility in the presurgical triage of patients undergoing adnexal mass surgery 
one additional finding related to medical necessity was the detection of early stage malignancies  since stage i cancers are curable if appropriately operated and treated 
of the malignancies in ova  were early stage and were stage i and of all malignancies  respectively 
ova standalone sensitivity in stratifying patients as high risk was for all early stage and for stage i malignancies  respectively 
comparatively  ca ii sensitivity was for all early stage and for stage i malignancies 
the success rate of ova classifying a benign mass as low risk  although of secondary importance considering surgery will be performed regardless  was also measured in the ova study 
this statistic specificity was overall  and in premenopausal patients was 
overall  the results strongly and independently confirmed the value of ova in presurgical triage of adnexal mass patients  and sensitive identification of premenopausal and early stage malignancies 

table of contents the ova study was recently published in the peer reviewed journal gynecologic oncology  which enjoys the highest impact factor rating of any journal worldwide focused on gynecologic oncology 
the results have also been incorporated into an updated medical education presentation  as well as our marketing and reimbursement collateral 
since many professional medical societies stress the importance of multiple independent clinical trials as so called evidence levels  we also believe that ova contributes to a higher evidence level relative to ova s utility in the medical management of adnexal masses 
health economic analysis indicates that anticipated benefits of ova include i more appropriate referrals of women with high risk of malignancy to a gynecologic oncologist and fewer referrals of women at low risk of malignancy  ii fewer second surgeries as a result of an initial surgery by a generalist on a woman with a malignant tumor  iii reduced need for a backup surgeon ie specialist during a surgery by a generalist  iv more appropriate and efficient administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy  v longer survival  associated with better quality of life 
peripheral arterial disease peripheral arterial disease pad represents atherosclerosis of the lower extremities and is generally reflective of systemic atherosclerotic disease and is therefore a risk factor for adverse cardiac events such as myocardial infarction and stroke 
this disease affects between million americans  and the number of people diagnosed with pad is expected to increase concurrently with the rising number of people diagnosed with diabetes 
the american heart association and the american college of cardiology have identified three demographics at risk for pad smokers years of age or older  diabetics years of age or older  and the elderly years of age or older 
collectively  this represents tens of millions of americans 
pad is most commonly diagnosed using the ankle brachial index abi  which is performed using a handheld doppler 
blood pressures are measured in the arm and at the ankles and the ratio ankle arm is calculated 
non affected individuals should have a ratio of or greater  while individuals with a ratio of less than are defined as having pad 
although the abi has good sensitivity and specificity for pad  its implementation into routine clinical practice has been hampered by poor physician adoption  generally because of the need to utilize special equipment by a specially trained technician and the need to have the patient lie supine in an examination room for to minutes prior to the administration of this test 
additionally  studies have shown that the abi is often performed incorrectly 
recently  a bedside instrument has been introduced to simplify pad testing  in which blood pressure measurement and user operation have been greatly simplified 
the system  called unetixs revo  eliminates pre test resting and takes less than minutes to produce a result 
however  the instrument retails for over  and uses pulse volume waveforms  rather than doppler waveforms  and requires technician training and accurate placement of pressure cuffs 
our pad experts advise us that this method has had little uptake and does not produce a validated abi score 
therefore  a blood test that can be more routinely implemented and reliably drawn by primary care providers has potential in identifying at increased risk of pad  for referral to vascular medicine specialists 
in collaboration with john p 
cooke  md  md  a professor and associate director of the stanford cardiovascular institute at stanford university school of medicine  we have performed both an initial discovery study and a first validation study that has resulted in the identification of blood markers that could assist in the diagnosis of pad 
these findings form the basis of a novel blood test for identification and specialist referral of patients at higher risk for pad  similar to the use of ova to detect and refer patients at higher risk of ovarian malignancy 
the results of these early studies  including the publication of two blood markers for pad  were published in the august on line issue of the peer reviewed journal circulation  which is published by the american heart association the aha 
independent validation of these initial findings was subsequently published in the peer reviewed journal vascular medicine in this study  which encompassed individuals  confirmed the elevation of the two biomarkers in subjects with pad 
moreover  the study showed that a panel of markers improved the identification of subjects with pad and was complementary to available data  including the aha risk score 
in this study  subjects with a moderate aha risk score but elevated pad biomarker score had almost a times increased likelihood of having pad than if they had a normal pad biomarker score 

table of contents the pad intended use study  titled a validated biomarker panel to identify peripheral artery disease  and published in the december edition of vascular medicine  was authored by dr 
william hiatt  novartis foundation endowed professor for cardiovascular research at the university of colorado school of medicine  division of cardiology 
the article reported the results of a multi center  prospective clinical study of  subjects  consecutively enrolled from the pad at risk population of those aged or older  and diabetics and smokers or older 
several different multi marker algorithms were evaluated in at risk patients with or without pad  and compared to conventional cardiovascular risk assessment by the framingham risk score frs 
the best model demonstrated a c statistic of and more important  identified of of patients with pad who were missed by the frs high risk cutoff 
similar results were seen in asymptomatic pad subjects  where the algorithm correctly classified 
in a statement  the study s co author dr 
cooke commented  since one in every americans over the age of has pad  this study suggests the possibility for a simple and practical way to screen at risk patients 
by detecting undiagnosed or asymptomatic pad  primary care physicians can intervene earlier and improve the health and prognosis for their patients 
we are truly excited at the confirmation our biomarker research achieved in this large group of at risk subjects  and look forward to advancing our program 
commercialization we expect to commercialize and sell diagnostic tests which may consist of reagents and or proprietary software in one or both of two phases 
one phase  referred to as the laboratory developed test ldt phase  will involve the sale of certain reagents which may be in the form of proprietary software to certain customers coupled with the grant to such customer of a sublicense to utilize the reagent in a laboratory developed test using the methodology covered by the relevant license s obtained from our collaborators 
an ldt would comprise multiple reagents such as assay test kits  software  or other reagents  some of which would be supplied by us  and would be utilized by clinical laboratories to develop and perform home brew laboratory tests in laboratories federally regulated under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of clia 
in the other phase  referred to as the ivd phase  we plan to sell fda cleared devices which may comprise multiple reagents such as assay test kits  software  or other reagents 
under the terms of the amended strategic alliance agreement  quest diagnostics had the right to commercialize up to three diagnostic tests from our product pipeline 
prior to the expiration of the strategic alliance  quest diagnostics selected two tests  peripheral arterial disease blood test and ova we believe quest diagnostics no longer has the right to select the final diagnostic test 
pursuant to the amended strategic alliance agreement  quest diagnostics will have the non exclusive right to commercialize each of the tests other than ova in the clinical reference laboratory marketplace on a worldwide basis  with exclusive commercialization rights in each exclusive territory  as this term is defined in the amended strategic alliance agreement  beginning on the date each test is first commercialized and ending on the third anniversary of the date that such test is cleared or approved by the fda 
quest has exclusive commercialization rights to commercialize ova in the clinical reference laboratory marketplace in each exclusive territory through september and the right to extend the exclusivity period for one additional year 
these exclusive territories consist of the united states  india  mexico  and the united kingdom 
quest diagnostics has the non exclusive right to commercialize ova on a worldwide basis outside of these exclusive territories 
customers in the united states  the ivd market can be segmented into three major groups clinical reference laboratories  the largest of which are quest diagnostics and laboratory corporation of america  hospital laboratories  and physician offices 
initially  substantially all of our revenue in the united states will be generated through clinical reference laboratories  and quest diagnostics will be the major customer 
in  we plan to begin a direct selling effort to hospitals which have the required instrumentation and testing capabilities to perform the markers that are in the ova product and utilize the ovacalc algorithm 
outside the united 
table of contents states  laboratories may become customers  either directly with us or via distribution relationships established between us and authorized distributors 
in we plan to begin to actively seek out distributors partners for the european marketplace 
research and development our research and development efforts center on the discovery and validation of biomarkers and combinations of biomarkers that can be developed into diagnostic assays 
we do this predominantly through collaborations we have established with academic institutions such as jhu  rigshospitalet  and stanford as well as through contract research organizations cro s such as precisionmed and the colorado prevention center 
in addition  we actively seek collaborations and initiate dialog with clinical academics  in order to generate publications  intellectual property or test development in broader areas of gynecologic oncology 
scientific background genes are the hereditary coding system of living organisms 
genes encode proteins that are responsible for cellular functions 
the study of genes and their functions has led to the discovery of new targets for drug development 
industry sources estimate that  within the human genome  there are approximately  genes 
although the primary structure of a protein is determined by a gene  the active structure of a protein is frequently altered by interactions with additional genes or proteins 
these subsequent modifications result in hundreds of thousands of different proteins 
in addition  proteins may interact with one another to form complex structures that are ultimately responsible for cellular functions 
genomics allows researchers to establish the relationship between gene activity and disease 
however  many diseases are manifested not at the genetic level  but at the protein level 
the complete structure of modified proteins cannot be determined by reference to the encoding gene alone 
thus  while genomics provides some information about diseases  it does not provide a full understanding of disease processes 
we are focused on converting recent advances in proteomics into clinically useful diagnostic tests 
relationship between proteins and diseases the entire genetic content of any organism  known as its genome  is encoded in strands of deoxyribonucleic acid dna 
cells perform their normal biological functions through the genetic instructions encoded in their dna  which results in the production of proteins 
the process of producing proteins from dna is known as gene expression or protein expression 
differences in living organisms result from variability in their genomes  which can affect the types of genes expressed and the levels of gene expression 
each cell of an organism expresses only approximately to of the genome 
the type of cell determines which genes are expressed and the amount of a particular protein produced 
for example  liver cells produce different proteins from those produced by cells found in the heart  lungs  skin  etc 
proteins play a crucial role in virtually all biological processes  including transportation and storage of energy  immune protection  generation and transmission of nerve impulses and control of growth 
diseases may be caused by a mutation of a gene that alters a protein directly or indirectly  or alters the level of protein expression 
these alterations interrupt the normal balance of proteins and create disease symptoms 
a protein biomarker is a protein or protein variant that is present in a greater or lesser amount in a disease state versus a normal condition 
by studying changes in protein biomarkers  researchers may identify diseases prior to the appearance of physical symptoms 
historically  researchers discovered protein biomarkers as a byproduct of basic biological disease research  which resulted in the validation by researchers of approximately protein biomarkers that are being used in commercially available clinical diagnostic products 
limitations of existing diagnostic approaches the ivd industry manufactures and distributes products that are used to detect thousands of individual components present in human derived specimens 
however  the vast majority of these assays are used specifically to identify single protein biomarkers 
the development of new diagnostic products has been limited 
table of contents by the complexity of disease states  which may be caused or characterized by several or many proteins or post translationally modified protein variants 
diagnostic assays that are limited to the detection of a single protein often have limitations in clinical specificity true negatives and sensitivity true positives due to the complex nature of many diseases and the inherent biological diversity among populations of people 
diagnostic products that are limited to the detection of a single protein may lack the ability to detect more complex diseases  and thus produce results that are unacceptable for practical use 
the heterogeneity of disease and of the human response to disease often underlies the shortcoming of single biomarkers to diagnose and predict many diseases accurately 
our solution our studies  particularly in ovarian cancer  have given us a better understanding of both the disease pathophysiology and the host response 
by using multiple biomarkers  we are able to better characterize the disease and host response heterogeneity 
in addition  by examining specific biomarkers and their variants  for example  post translational modifications  we believe we can improve sensitivity and specificity over traditional diagnostic biomarkers because these biomarker combinations reflect both the pathophysiology and host response 
this is accomplished using novel biomarker panels coupled with multivariate pattern recognition software to identify ivdmia algorithms which can be commercialized as disease specific assays 
we are applying translational biomarker research  algorithm development tools  and statistical error modeling methods to discover robust associations between biomarker panels and clinically relevant disease endpoints 
we plan to develop new ivdmia algorithms and molecular diagnostic tests based on known and newly identified protein markers to help physicians better predict and manage disease and treatment  and thereby improve patient outcomes and overall health economic resource utilization 
examples of diagnostic applications include  but are not limited to asymptomatic population screening  early detection  triage to specialists  aid in diagnosis  prognosis or disease sub classification  prediction or selection of therapy  monitoring of therapeutic response or residual disease  monitoring for recurrence or identification of appropriate fallback therapy or clinical trial eligibility 
we therefore anticipate ongoing and new partnerships with leading scientific and clinical institutions who have active proteomic or genomic programs in the area of gynecologic cancers  or with relevant clinical trial interests  with the goal of expanding our product portfolio with relevant solutions to unmet medical needs in women s health 
addressing the heterogeneity of disease our strategy is to create a diagnostics paradigm that is based on risk estimation  multiple biomarker testing and information integration 
this strategy is based on the belief that cancer and other gynecologic diseases are heterogeneous and  therefore  that relying on a single disease biomarker to provide a simple yes no answer is likely to fail 
we believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level  meaning that most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies  and at the individual response level  meaning that each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner 
consequently  diagnosis  disease monitoring and treatment decisions can be challenging 
this heterogeneity of disease and difference in human response to disease and or treatment underlies the shortcomings of single biomarkers to predict and identify many diseases 
a better understanding of heterogeneity of disease and human response is necessary for improved diagnosis and treatment of many diseases 
validation of biomarkers through proper study design analysis of peer reviewed publications reveals almost daily reports of novel biomarkers or biomarker combinations associated with specific diseases 
few of these are used clinically 
as with drug discovery  preliminary research results fail to canvass sufficient variation in study populations or laboratory practices and  
table of contents therefore  the vast majority of candidate biomarkers fail to be substantiated in subsequent studies 
recognizing that validation is the point at which most biomarkers fail  our strategy is to reduce the attrition rate between discovery and clinical implementation by building validation into the discovery process 
biomarkers fail to validate for a number of reasons  which can be broadly classified into pre analytical and analytical factors 
pre analytical factors include study design that does not mimic actual clinical practice  inclusion of the wrong types of control individuals and demographic bias usually seen in studies in which samples are collected from a single institution 
analytical factors include poor control over laboratory protocols  inadequate randomization of study samples and instrumentation biases for example  higher signal early in the experimental run compared to later in the experimental run 
finally  the manner in which the data are analyzed can have a profound impact on the reliability of the statistical conclusions 
when designing clinical studies  we begin with the clinical question  since this drives the downstream clinical utility of the biomarkers 
with the starting point of building validation into the discovery process  we design our studies to include the appropriate cases and control groups 
we further incorporate an initial validation component even within the discovery component 
we place an emphasis on multi institutional studies  inclusion of clinically relevant controls  using qualified and trained operators to run assays and collect data 
for example  in an august cancer research paper  which describes the first three biomarkers in the ovarian cancer panel  there were more than specimen samples taken from five hospitals that were analyzed 
in the development of ova  we analyzed more than  samples from five additional medical centers prior to initiating the prospective ovarian clinical study for submission to the fda 
additionally to date  we have examined over samples in our pad program 
in analyzing the complex proteomics data  we take a skeptical view of statistical methodologies  choosing to use a variety of approaches and looking for concordance between approaches  taking the view that biomarkers deemed significant by multiple statistical algorithms are more likely to reflect biological conditions than mathematical artifacts 
through biomarker discovery efforts conducted predominantly from through  we have amassed a portfolio of candidate biomarkers identified in retrospective sample sets 
our research and development efforts are now mostly focused on validating these biomarkers in prospective studies 
during the period from through  we conducted a multi center prospective clinical trial to determine the clinical performance of ova  which was submitted to the fda on june   and cleared by the fda on september  we have additional markers for ovarian cancer that we plan to evaluate and validate 
additionally  we completed a prospective intended use study for pad in these activities are outlined below 
r d sponsored initiatives to support market development of ova we have two ongoing r d sponsored initiatives to support ova market development and adoption as an improved standard of care in the pre surgical triage and evaluation of adnexal masses 
the first is a major new clinical study of ova  focused on its performance in the predominantly pre menopausal non gynecologic oncologist patient population 
the study  called ova  has resulted in first publication in the february edition of gynecologic oncology  a peer reviewed journal with the highest impact factor rating of any journal worldwide focused on gynecologic oncology 
ova was conducted to confirm and extend the landmark findings of ueland and miller  published in obstetrics gynecology in the june edition  with a completely new  prospectively enrolled patient cohort 
the findings of ova  reported in gynecologic oncology  are summarized in a preceding section of this document 
additional manuscripts are in preparation to follow up on the initial study report  and will be submitted in the first or second quarter of the second r d initiative supporting ova is a series of vermillion assisted  independent clinical research studies of ova through this new program  vermillion offers limited support for well qualified principal investigators in the form of materials  testing services  and scientific consulting 
as a result  we are currently in discussion with a number of potential investigators  to support new research publications on ova s clinical utility  cost effectiveness  and potential line extensions 
while agreements are still pending  at least one study has begun enrolling patients under a clinical institution irb approval 

table of contents new ovarian cancer indications 
while our focus on supporting the commercialization of ova is our primary priority  we also may extend our ovarian cancer franchise beyond ova  enabled by three key initiatives 
first  we have just signed a year extension of a research and license agreement with jhu to evaluate markers that provide improved specificity in the detection of ovarian cancer 
candidate markers are currently being assessed in small  pilot sample sets 
markers demonstrating high specificity may then be assessed in larger  clinical samples sets 
pilot results of these studies were reported in early at the society of gynecologic oncologists 
second  our research and license agreement with rigshospitalet copenhagen generated data showing that a certain combination of markers can separate ovarian cancer patients into those with good prognosis from those with poor prognosis 
these results were published in and we filed a patent application 
third  the acquisition of correlogic assets in brings with it highly curated clinical samples  intellectual property and promising biomarker leads 
these have the potential to further amplify our ovarian cancer diagnostic efforts in the future 
prospective intended use clinical study for peripheral arterial disease pad 
in  we completed an intended use study to validate a multi marker algorithm for the assessment of individuals at risk for pad 
the pad intended use study  titled a validated biomarker panel to identify peripheral artery disease  and published in the december edition of vascular medicine  was authored by dr 
william hiatt  novartis foundation endowed professor for cardiovascular research at the university of colorado school of medicine  division of cardiology 
the article reported the results of a multi center  prospective clinical study of  subjects  consecutively enrolled from the pad at risk population of those aged or older  and diabetics and smokers or older 
several different multi marker algorithms were evaluated in at risk patients with or without pad  and compared to conventional cardiovascular risk assessment by the framingham risk score frs 
the best model demonstrated a c statistic of and more important  identified of of patients with pad who were missed by the frs high risk cutoff 
similar results were seen in asymptomatic pad subjects  where the algorithm correctly classified 
in a statement  the study s co author dr 
cooke commented  since one in every americans over the age of has pad  this study suggests the possibility for a simple and practical way to screen at risk patients 
by detecting undiagnosed or asymptomatic pad  primary care physicians can intervene earlier and improve the health and prognosis for their patients 
we are truly excited at the confirmation our biomarker research achieved in this large group of at risk subjects  and look forward to advancing our program 
our pad achievements  intellectual property and publications will support future discussions with potential development commercial partners and help to define the appropriate validation pathway  which may be as an fda approved or cleared test  or as a laboratory developed test validated under the auspices of a clia regulated clinical laboratory 
our path forward is to evaluate partnering options for the pad program with third parties who have substantial presence in the cardiovascular market  as well as the funding and development capabilities to take this important blood test to market 
our research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease from the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in clinical trial costs for the ongoing development of our ovarian cancer franchise and our pad program as our pad intended use study was completed in the clinical trial cost decrease was net of ongoing expenses for our ova fda post marketing study that commenced during commercial operations we have a commercial infrastructure  including sales and marketing and reimbursement expertise 
our sales representatives work with quest diagnostics to identify opportunities for communicating the benefits of ova to general gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists alike 
our success will also depend on our ability to penetrate markets outside of the united states 
ova is ce marked  a requirement for marketing the test in the european union 
ova has satisfied all certification requirements to complete its declaration of conformity 

table of contents at the end of  approximately  ova tests had been performed in the calendar year  an increase of over additionally  we estimate over gynecologic oncologists are supportive or advocating the use of ova for the triage of women with adnexal masses 
this broad number of specialists supporting the test indicates an understanding of the unmet clinical need and the ability of ova to serve a significant market to assist physicians to triage women who need a specialist for surgery from those who can be treated by the primary physician 
as of december  over  doctors had ordered the test  an increase of over we continue to develop the market through experienced territory development managers and have expanded their scope of responsibility 
as market awareness continues to build  these managers are focused on efforts that will have a positive impact on regional payers and create positive coverage decisions 
they are working with local key opinion leaders and meeting with medical directors to discuss the unmet clinical need  our technology assessment package and increasing experience and cases studies showing the positive outcomes utilizing ova in  our territory development managers will also be targeting key hospital accounts that are interested in providing ova results to their ob gyn and gyn onc physicians 
these hospitals must have the required instrumentation as required in our product requirements insert to be eligible to perform the ova risk algorithm 
there are still obstacles to overcome and significant milestones to attain to insure ongoing success 
first  although the test volume and the number of doctors continue to increase  the average gynecologist will only see about to appropriate patients per month and additional effort will be required to establish a consistent ordering pattern 
second  insurance coverage and patient bills are a concern to the physician and can disrupt the ordering pattern of a generalist who is supportive of ova reimbursement in the united states  revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources  including third party payers such as insurance companies and government healthcare programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
in  we announced that highmark medicare services  the medicare contractor that has jurisdiction over claims submitted by quest diagnostics for ova  will cover ova this local coverage determination from highmark medicare services essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in medicare as well as medicare advantage health plans 
we have worked together with quest diagnostics to obtain coverage and reimbursement from private payers across the country 
as of january   twenty seven independent bluecross blueshield plans  representing more than million lives  provide coverage for ova in total  including medicare and other private payers  approximately million patients have access and coverage for ova the company and quest diagnostics continue to pursue coverage from additional payers 
on march   the american medical association ama current procedural terminology cpt panel voted to approve an application for a category i cpt code for ova  which became effective january  the new cpt code is a positive step forward in advancing the commercialization of ova  as we believe it will help streamline claims processing and accelerate further coverage and adoption by private payers 
new and innovative diagnostic tests often face reimbursement challenges that can affect adoption  the three key focus areas are coding  claims  and coverage or payer adoption 
in conjunction with quest diagnostics  we are consistently addressing these three areas 
coding ova is a new class of diagnostics and therefore no specific code existed at the time of its launch 
this is often the case with new diagnostic tests and companies will bill using a miscellaneous code which is the path we and quest diagnostics implemented 
now  after establishing ova in the market  creating demand  demonstrating the utility of the test  obtaining coverage and reimbursement  we filed for a cpt code specific for ova in  which was effective beginning january  achieving the unique category i cpt code was a critical step our commercialization process 

table of contents the test is priced in by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms using their gap fill process 
cms uses this process when no comparable test exists 
medicare currently reimburses ova at per test and our test list price is claims process in the early launch of a product  claims can be rejected due to lack of medical necessity  lack of payer understanding  or even billing process errors 
to address these items  our territory development managers are engaging with physicians offices to assist in the appeals process and are using these claims to educate payers and create awareness about the medical necessity of our test 
payer coverage we continue to focus on going efforts toward obtaining national coverage decisions 
however  these decisions typically have a much longer lead time due to industry established processes and time frames 
in most cases  these entail clinical and technical reviews that are performed on an annual basis 
we have assembled a technology assessment package that will provide a nucleus of materials tailored to each national plan 
we have launched a program to aid local key opinion leaders to work with health plans to support coverage for ova these strategic actions are necessary steps to convert those plans representing numerous regional payers and late adopters 
competition the diagnostics industry in which we operate is competitive and evolving 
there is intense competition among healthcare  biotechnology and diagnostics companies attempting to discover candidates for potential new diagnostic products 
these companies may develop new diagnostic products in advance of us or our collaborators  develop diagnostic products that are more effective or cost effective than those developed by us or our collaborators  obtain regulatory clearance or approval of their diagnostic products more rapidly than us or our collaborators  or obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit the ability to develop and commercialize  or a customers ability to use our or our collaborators diagnostic products 
we compete with companies in the united states and abroad that are engaged in the development and commercialization of novel biomarkers that may form the basis of novel diagnostic tests 
these companies may develop products that are competitive with and or perform the same or similar to the products offered by us or our collaborators  such as biomarker specific reagents or diagnostic test kits 
also  clinical laboratories may offer testing services that are competitive with the products sold by us or our collaborators 
for example  a clinical laboratory can either use reagents purchased from manufacturers other than us or use its own internally developed reagents to make diagnostic tests 
if clinical laboratories make tests in this manner for a particular disease  they could offer testing services for that disease as an alternative to products sold by us used to test for the same disease 
the testing services offered by clinical laboratories may be easier to develop and market than test kits developed by us or our collaborators because the testing services are not subject to the same clinical validation requirements that are applicable to fda cleared or approved diagnostic test kits 
in september  fujirebio diagnostics received fda clearance for risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm 
this test combines two tumor markers and menopausal status into a numerical score using a publicly available algorithm 
this test has the same intended use and precautions as ova the risk of ovarian 
table of contents malignancy algorithm is currently marketed as having utility limited to epithelial ovarian cancers  which accounts for of ovarian malignancies 
the two tests have not been compared in a side by side cohort evaluation to date  so no direct performance comparisons can be made

in addition  under the terms of the amended research collaboration agreement  we are required to pay the greater of royalties on net sales of diagnostic tests using the assigned patents or annual minimum royalties of  other institutions and companies from which we hold options to license intellectual property related to biomarkers or are a co inventor on applications include ucl  md anderson  uk  osu  mcgill university canada  eastern virginia medical school  aaron diamond aids research center  utmb  goteborg university sweden  university of kuopio finland  the katholieke universiteit leuven belgium and rigshospitalet 
manufacturing we are the manufacturer of ova components of ova include reagents for each of the component assays as well as the ovacalc software 
because we do not directly manufacture the component assays  we are required to maintain supply agreements with manufacturers of each of the assays 
as part of our quality systems  reagent lots for these assays are tested to ensure they meet specifications required for inclusion in ova only reagent lots determined by us as having met these specifications are permitted for use in ova environmental matters medical waste we have been subject to licensing and regulation under federal  state and local laws relating to the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste as well as to the safety and health of laboratory employees 
our laboratories were operated in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to disposal of all laboratory specimens 
we utilized outside vendors for disposal of specimens 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials 
in addition  claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use  or the use by third parties  of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development or production efforts 
occupational safety in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace  the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis virus 
these regulations  among other things  require work practice controls  protective clothing and equipment  training  medical follow up  vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals and transmission of the blood borne and airborne pathogens 
although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal  state and local laws  failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business  fines  criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 
specimen transportation regulations of the department of transportation  the international air transportation agency  the public health service and the postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens 
although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal  state and local laws  failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business  fines  criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 
government regulation general 
our activities related to diagnostic products are  or have the potential to be  subject to regulatory oversight by the fda under provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and regulations thereunder  including regulations governing the development  marketing  labeling  promotion  manufacturing and export of 
table of contents our products 
the food  drug and cosmetic act requires that medical devices introduced to the united states market  unless exempted by regulation  be the subject of either a pre market notification clearance  known as a k clearance or k de novo clearance  or a pma 
ova was cleared by the fda on september  under the k de novo guidelines 
ova was the first fda cleared blood test for the pre operative assessment of ovarian masses 
we have not yet established a regulatory pathway for our future potential products such as our pad test and our next generation ovarian cancer test 
clinical studies to support either a k submission or a pma application would need to be conducted in accordance with fda requirements 
if the fda indicates that a pma is required for any of our potential future clinical products  the application will require extensive clinical studies  manufacturing information and likely review by a panel of experts outside the fda 
additionally  the fda will generally conduct a pre approval inspection for pma devices 
even in the case of devices like analyte specific reagents asrs  which may be exempt from k clearance or pma approval requirements  the fda may impose restrictions on marketing 
our potential future asr products may be sold only to clinical laboratories certified under the clia to perform high complexity testing 
in addition to requiring approval or clearance for new products  the fda may require approval or clearance prior to marketing products that are modifications of existing products or the intended uses of these products 
additionally  the fda will generally conduct a pre approval inspection for pma devices 
our suppliers manufacturing facilities are  and  if and when we begin commercializing and manufacturing our products ourselves  our manufacturing facilities will be  subject to periodic and unannounced inspections by the fda and state agencies for compliance with quality system regulations qsrs 
additionally  the fda will generally conduct a pre approval inspection for pma devices 
although we believe that we and our suppliers will be able to operate in compliance with the fda s qsrs for asrs  we cannot assure that we or our suppliers will be in or be able to maintain compliance in the future 
we have never been subject to an fda inspection and cannot assure that we will pass an inspection  if and when it occurs 
if the fda believes that we or our suppliers are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations  the fda can issue a form list of observations  warning letter  detain or seize our products  issue a recall notice  enjoin future violations and assess civil and criminal penalties against us 
in addition  approvals or clearances could be withdrawn under certain circumstances 
any customers using our products for clinical use in the united states may be regulated under clia  which is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality control  quality assurance and inspections 
the regulations promulgated under clia establish three levels of diagnostic tests namely  waived  moderately complex and highly complex and the standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of the tests it performs 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the united states 
these range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our potential future medical device products  to requests for product data or certifications 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
in addition  products which have not yet been cleared or approved for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to the fda export reform and enhancement act of fdera 
fda regulation of cleared tests 
once granted  a k clearance or pma approval may place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or to whom it may be sold 
all devices cleared by the fda are subject to continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies 
as a medical device manufacturer  we are also required to register and list our products with the fda 
we are required to set forth and adhere to a quality policy and other regulations 
in addition  we are required to comply with the fda s qsrs  which require that our devices be manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and control activities 
additionally  we may be subject to inspection by federal and state regulatory agencies 
non compliance with these standards can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls  total or partial suspension of production 
further  we are required to comply with fda requirements for labeling and promotion 
for example  the fda prohibits cleared or approved devices from being promoted for uncleared or unapproved uses 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by 
table of contents the fda  which prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses 
additionally  the fda requires us to perform certain post marketing studies post market surveillance to verify or validate the clinical performance of fda cleared tests  as is permitted by their statutory authority 
in addition  the medical device reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the fda whenever evidence reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
foreign government regulation of our products 
we intend to obtain regulatory approval in other countries to market our tests 
each country maintains its own regulatory review process  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements  product standards  and labeling requirements
