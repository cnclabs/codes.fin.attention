table of contents our financial results for the fiscal year ended august  reflect continued growth and building momentum in the marketplace as we experienced increased sales  improved operating results  and strengthened our financial position during the fiscal year 
our net sales in fiscal increased to million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal our fiscal sales represent percent growth compared with fiscal and percent growth compared with fiscal our fiscal fourth quarter sales totaled million  which is a percent increase over the fourth quarter of fiscal and represents the strongest quarterly sales performance ever under our current business model 
sales growth was generally broad based across our primary delivery channels and course offerings during the year 
the following table sets forth sales data by category and by our primary delivery channels in thousands year ended august  percent change percent change sales by category training and consulting services products leasing sales by channel us canada direct international direct international licensees national account practices self funded marketing other nearly all of our major practices and content groups had increased sales compared with the prior year and we believe that our ongoing investments in curriculum development and increasing the size of our sales force will help us maintain this favorable sales growth momentum 
our gross profit for fiscal increased to million compared with million in fiscal primarily due to increased sales 
our gross margin  which is gross profit as a percent of sales  increased to percent compared with percent in fiscal primarily due to increased facilitator and intellectual property sales  and increased international licensee royalty revenues 
our operating expenses in fiscal increased million compared with fiscal primarily due to an million increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses and a million increase in amortization expense that were partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation expense 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses was primarily driven by increased commissions and bonuses on higher sales during fiscal and investments in new sales and sales support personnel 
increased sales and improved operating margins combined to increase our fiscal income from operations by percent to million compared with million in fiscal including the benefit of foreign tax credits  which reduced our effective income tax rate to approximately percent in fiscal  our net income increased percent to million  or

business overview we believe that the combination of creating best in class content and solutions in each of our practice areas  and continuing to invest in the refinement and expansion of each of our content categories  and significantly increasing the size and capabilities of our various sales and content delivery channels are the foundation of our long term strategic growth plan 
each year we make significant investments in the development and enhancement of our existing content  and to develop new services  features  and products 
we expect to continue the introduction of new or refreshed content and delivery methods and consider them key to our long term success 
at the same time  we continue to make substantial investments each year to expand the size and capabilities of our sales and delivery forces to take our solutions to market in a way which attracts and retains client organizations 
during the third quarter of fiscal we acquired substantially all of the assets of ninetyfive  llc ninetyfive 
ninetyfive provides sales success training services that complement our existing sales performance content 
we believe that the acquisition of ninetyfive and its integration into our sales performance practice will be highly synergistic for our clients and we expect ninetyfive to become a key component of our sale performance practice in future periods 
other key factors that influence our operating results include the size and productivity of our sales force  the number and productivity of our international licensee operations  the number of organizations that are active customers  the number of people trained within those organizations  the continuation or renewal of existing services contracts  the availability of budgeted training spending at our clients and prospective clients  which  in certain content categories  can be significantly influenced by general economic conditions  and our ability to manage operating costs necessary to develop and provide meaningful training and related services and products to our clients

results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through income before income taxes in our consolidated income statements 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements 
table of contents year ended august  sales training and consulting services products leasing total sales cost of sales training and consulting services products leasing total cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative depreciation amortization total operating expenses income from operations interest income interest expense discount on related party receivable other income  net income before income taxes fiscal compared with fiscal sales we offer a variety of training content and training related offerings that are focused on improving leadership  execution  productivity  trust  loyalty  sales performance  and educational results 
these offerings are provided  both domestically and internationally  through our sales force  certified client facilitators  international licensee partners  or through technology enabled solutions 
for the fiscal year ended august   our consolidated sales increased by million  or percent  to million 
the following sales analysis for the fiscal year ended august  is based on activity through our primary sales channels 
us canada direct offices this channel includes our four regional field offices that serve clients in the united states and canada and our government services group 
during fiscal  sales through our regional offices increased by million  or percent compared with the prior year 
increased sales through our regional sales offices were generally broad based across our content and practice areas and were favorably impacted by increased facilitator and intellectual property license sales when compared with fiscal during fiscal we held additional marketing events and increased the number of sales and sales support personnel 
we believe that the additional events and sales personnel were key drivers of increased sales at our regional sales offices during the year 
partially offsetting increased regional office sales was a million decline in government services sales 
our government services revenues were adversely affected by government sequestration  and the contracting timeframe for a large government contract 
previous annual renewals of this contract have occurred during our third fiscal quarter 
during fiscal  the contract renewal process was postponed and occurred during our first quarter of fiscal subsequent to august  we won a renewal of the contract for a portion of fiscal and  later in fiscal  we hope to obtain an extended renewal of this large contract for the remainder of fiscal and beyond 
we will continue our efforts to win additional renewals of this contract in the future  but we cannot guarantee a successful outcome  as many of the aspects of renewal are not within our control  including factors such as the partial government shutdown that occurred during the fall of 
table of contents although we are encouraged about future growth prospects through the us canada direct office channel  our sales through this channel in the first quarter of fiscal and in future periods could be significantly impacted by our ability to obtain work orders on governmental contracts due to the persistence of governmental operating issues in the united states  the renewal of the other existing contracts  and general economic conditions 
international direct offices our three international direct offices are located in australia  japan  and the united kingdom 
during fiscal  sales increased at all of our international direct offices  which were led by a million improvement at our office in australia 
sales increased by million at our office in japan and by million in the united kingdom 
however  the translation of international sales into us dollars had a million adverse impact on reported sales as the us dollar strengthened during fiscal  particularly against the japanese yen 
in fiscal  sales at our japan office denominated in yen increased by percent compared with fiscal we anticipate that foreign exchange rates primarily the japanese yen will continue to have an adverse effect on our reported sales through december when compared to the prior year 
during fiscal we implemented hiring and go to market strategies in our international direct offices which are consistent with those implemented in our domestic direct offices  including holding more marketing events and hiring additional sales personnel 
we believe that these factors began to have a favorable impact on the sales activity in our international direct offices during fiscal when compared with the prior year 
we expect these initiatives will also increase sales during fiscal and in future periods 
international licensees in countries or foreign locations where we do not have a direct office  our training and content offerings and services are delivered through independent licensees  who  subject to strict standards  may translate and adapt our content to match local preferences and customs 
in fiscal  international licensee royalties increased million compared with the prior year as many of our licensees reported strengthening sales in their countries during the year 
we believe that our increased efforts to support our licensees through additional program training  international branding  and the introduction of new offerings has had a favorable impact on their sales growth in fiscal we are continuing our efforts to improve licensee performance and expect continued growth from our international licensee partners during future periods 
national account practices our national account practices offer and sell content solutions that are not typically offered in our u 
s canada direct offices 
these offerings include  in the education practice  the leader in me program designed for students primarily in k elementary schools  helping clients succeed from our sales performance practice  and winning customer loyalty from our customer loyalty practice 
the increase in revenue from our national account practices was due to increased sales in our education and sales performance practices 
we continue to see increased demand for the leader in me program in many school districts in the united states as well as in some international locations  which contributed to a million  or percent  increase in education practice revenues compared with fiscal at august   over  elementary level schools were using the leader in me program  and we anticipate continued growth in future periods 
we completed the acquisition of ninetyfive during the third quarter of fiscal  which was added as a component of the sales performance practice 
primarily as a result of this acquisition  our sales performance practice sales increased by million compared with the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in customer loyalty practice sales 
self funded marketing this group includes our book and audio sales  public programs  and speeches through our speakers bureau 
the decrease in self funded marketing sales was mainly due to book and audio distribution royalties received in the first and third quarters of fiscal that did not repeat in fiscal we expect to continue to release new publications in future periods and 
table of contents believe that these new publications will continue to show strong performance in the marketplace and create additional royalty revenues 
other our other sales are comprised primarily of leasing sales and shipping and handling revenues 
the increase in other sales was primarily due to increased leasing revenues resulting from new lease contracts at our corporate headquarters 
however  during august one of our significant lease contracts expired and we are actively seeking new tenants for this available space 
our lease revenues will be adversely impacted in fiscal compared to prior periods until this available space is leased 
gross profit gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of services provided or the cost of goods sold 
our cost of sales includes the direct costs of delivering content onsite at client locations  including presenter costs  materials used in the production of training products and related assessments  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross profit may be affected by  among other things  the mix of practice solutions sold to clients  prices of materials  labor rates  changes in product discount levels  and freight costs 
our consolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended august  increased to million compared with million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily due to improved sales for the fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal  and to improved margin on our sales 
our consolidated gross margin increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared with percent in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased intellectual property license sales  increased facilitator sales  and increased international licensee royalties  all of which have higher gross margins than the majority of our other programs and services 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a our sg a expenses increased million  or percent  compared with the prior year 
as a percent of sales  our sg a expenses increased to percent compared with percent in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to an million increase in associate costs primarily related to additional commissions and bonuses on significantly higher sales in fiscal and investments in new sales related personnel  a million increase in advertising and promotional costs that were primarily related to strategic initiatives which we believe had a favorable impact on our fiscal year s sales  a million increase in travel expenses related primarily to marketing activities and increased training sales activity during the fiscal year  and a million increase in legal expenses that was due to the fiscal reimbursement of certain legal fees by fc organization products fcop and which did not repeat in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in non cash share based compensation 
the acquisition of ninetyfive in fiscal requires us to reassess the fair value of the contingent earnout payments each reporting period 
changes to the fair value of the expected amount of contingent consideration to be paid are required to be classified as an operating expense in future periods 
the changes in fair value may significantly increase or decrease our total operating income in future periods 
depreciation depreciation expense for fiscal decreased by million compared with fiscal primarily due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
based on capital asset acquisitions in fiscal and expected purchases during fiscal  we anticipate depreciation expense will total approximately million in fiscal amortization amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets increased million compared with the prior year due to the acquisition of ninetyfive during fiscal based on current carrying amounts of intangible assets and remaining estimated useful lives  we anticipate amortization expense will total million in fiscal 
table of contents interest income the increase in interest income was attributable to the accretion of interest on previously discounted long term receivables from fcop 
interest income is computed using the effective interest method using a rate of percent  which was the discount rate at which these receivables were marked to estimated net present value refer to discussion below 
discount on related party receivable we record receivables from fcop for reimbursement of certain operating costs  such as warehousing and distribution costs  which are billed to us by third party providers  and for working capital and other advances that we make  even though we are not contractually required to make advances or absorb the losses of fcop 
based on expected payment  some of these receivables are recorded as long term receivables and are required to be recorded at net present value 
we discounted the long term portion of the fcop receivable based on forecasted repayments at a discount rate of percent  which was the estimated risk adjusted borrowing rate of fcop 
income taxes our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended august  was approximately percent compared with percent in fiscal our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the benefit of foreign tax credits we plan to claim for fiscal through fiscal during those years we either generated or used net operating loss carryforwards and were unable to utilize foreign tax credits and instead took foreign tax deductions 
as of august  we have no remaining us federal net operating loss carryforwards 
additionally  overall taxable income and foreign source income in fiscal were sufficient to utilize all of the foreign tax credits generated during the fiscal year  plus additional credits generated in prior years 
based on these factors and our projected taxable income and foreign source income  we decided to amend our us federal income tax returns from fiscal through fiscal to claim foreign tax credits instead of foreign tax deductions 
the net tax benefit from claiming these additional foreign tax credits totaled million in fiscal consistent with fiscal  we expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to be lower than statutory combined rates as we claim the benefit of foreign tax credits 
however  we will not have the information necessary to determine the fiscal benefit until the fourth quarter 
accordingly  we anticipate that our effective income tax rate during the first three quarters of fiscal will be approximately percent 
we anticipate that our cash paid for income taxes will remain less than our income tax provision during the foreseeable future as we utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards and other deferred income tax assets 
for instance  during fiscal we paid million of cash for income taxes compared with an income tax provision of million 
after utilization of our foreign tax credit carryforwards  which we currently expect to be fully utilized by the end of fiscal  we anticipate that our cash paid for income taxes will increase and approximate our income tax provision 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales for the fiscal year ended august   our consolidated sales increased by million  or six percent  to million 
the following sales analysis for the fiscal year ended august  is based on activity through our primary sales channels as previously defined 
us canada direct offices during fiscal  sales through our four direct offices increased by million  or eight percent  compared with the prior year 
partially offsetting increased direct office 
table of contents sales were expected reductions from contracts with a governmental agency that included more revenue in the initial phases which occurred primarily in fiscal of the contracts than in subsequent periods 
as a result  sales through our government services group decreased million compared with fiscal however  during the third quarter of fiscal we won a renewal of these contracts with the governmental agency and we delivered training and consulting services throughout the life of these contracts  which included the first three quarters of fiscal international direct offices the improvement in international direct office sales compared with fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in sales at our japan office 
the sales growth in japan was primarily due to the recovery of the japanese economy from the effects of the earthquake and tsunami that struck northern japan during march sales were also up million at our office in the united kingdom during fiscal however  these increases were partially offset by a million decrease at our office in australia  which were primarily attributable to sales force performance issues that the company believes have been properly addressed 
during fiscal  the translation of sales from foreign currencies to united states dollars had a million favorable impact on our international office sales 
international licensees our licensee sales increased million compared with fiscal as many of our licensees reported strengthening sales in their countries during the year  which resulted in increased royalties 
national account practices during fiscal  our national account practice sales increased due to a million increase in education practice sales resulting from a general increase in demand for these school based services as the leader in me program continues to generate favorable results at schools in the united states and in other countries 
our sales performance practice also increased its sales by million over the prior year as this group obtained new contracts during the fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in customer loyalty practice sales primarily resulting from the completion of a large contract during fiscal self funded marketing the decrease in sales was due to reduced public speaking revenues resulting primarily from the retirement of dr 
stephen r 
covey from public speaking events in late fiscal decreased speakers bureau sales were partially offset by a million increase in book and audio product sales resulting primarily from the release of new publications during the year 
other the increase in other sales was primarily due to improved leasing revenues resulting from new lease contracts at our corporate headquarters 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit for the fiscal year ended august  increased to million compared with million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased sales in fiscal over fiscal and improved margin on our sales 
our consolidated gross margin increased to percent of sales in fiscal compared with percent in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to increased international licensee royalty revenues  increased facilitator sales  and increased intellectual property license sales  all of which have higher gross margins than the majority of our other programs and services 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative our sg a expenses in fiscal increased million compared with fiscal however  as a percent of sales  sg a expenses declined to percent of sales compared to percent in the prior year 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to a million increase in associate costs resulting from increased sales commissions and bonuses resulting from improved sales and operating results  and the addition of new personnel  a million 
table of contents increase in advertising and promotional costs that were primarily related to the launch of our new productivity offering  the choices to extraordinary productivity  and the launch of new strategic marketing initiatives that we believe had a favorable impact on overall fiscal sales  and a million increase in non cash share based compensation costs  primarily resulting from performance awards granted in the fourth quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in rent and utilities expenses primarily the result of reduced rent expense at our japan office and reduced telephone and communication expenses  a million decrease in legal expenses resulting primarily from the settlement of certain litigation and the reimbursement of previously expensed legal costs  million of decreased professional services costs compared to the prior year  and a million reduction in outsourced services charges resulting primarily from a reduction in outsourced information technology support costs 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased by million compared to fiscal primarily due to the full depreciation of certain capital assets during the latter half of fiscal amortization amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets decreased million due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets in late fiscal discount on related party receivable due to the settlement of litigation during fiscal  with a required settlement payment by fc organizational products  the amount of cash we received from fcop was reduced from previous forecasts and our receivable balance from fcop increased during fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we received revised information from fcop regarding scheduled payments to us and we reclassified a portion of the fcop receivable to long term assets and recorded a discount charge of million to reduce the long term receivable to its estimated present value at august  we discounted the long term portion of the receivable based on forecasted repayments at a discount rate of percent  which was the estimated risk adjusted borrowing rate of fcop at august  this rate was based on a variety factors including  but not limited to  current market interest rates for various qualities of comparable debt  discussions with fcop s lenders  and an evaluation of the realizability fcop s future cash flows 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was percent and remained consistent with fiscal our effective income tax rate was higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to taxable interest income on outstanding management common stock loans and uncertain tax positions 
these increases in our effective rate were partially offset by the benefit of foreign tax credits in excess of the tax on income taxed by both us and foreign jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal includes the benefit of foreign tax credits claimed on our us federal income tax returns for those fiscal years 
enterprise information our sales are primarily comprised of training and content sales and related products such as books  audio  and training accessories 
based on the consistent nature of our services and products and the types of customers for these services  we function as a single operating segment

quarterly fluctuations 
table of contents may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new offerings  the addition of new organizational customers  and the elimination of underperforming offerings 
liquidity and capital resources summary during fiscal our liquidity position strengthened as we improved our income from operations and repaid all remaining bank debt 
at august  we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared with million at august  and our net working capital current assets less current liabilities increased to million compared with million at august  of our million in cash and cash equivalents at august   million was held at our foreign subsidiaries 
we routinely repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries for which us taxes have previously been provided and consider foreign cash a key component of our overall liquidity position 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from the sale of content and services in the normal course of business  and proceeds from our available million revolving line of credit 
our primary uses of liquidity include payments for operating activities  capital expenditures  working capital expansion  business acquisitions  and debt repayment 
on march  we entered into the third modification agreement the third modification agreement to our previously existing amended and restated secured credit agreement the restated credit agreement with our existing lender 
the primary purposes of the third modification agreement are to extend the maturity date of the restated credit agreement from march  to march  and to increase the caps for permitted business acquisitions 
the third modification agreement continues to provide a revolving line of credit facility with a maximum borrowing amount of million with interest at libor plus percent 
the restated credit agreement also provided a term loan the term loan that allowed us to borrow million for general business purposes 
the final payment on the term loan was due on september   however  we repaid the remaining balance prior to august  we had no outstanding obligations on our restated credit agreement at august  we may use our line of credit facility for general corporate purposes as well as for other transactions  unless prohibited by the terms of the line of credit agreement 
the restated credit agreement and subsequent modifications also contain customary representations and guarantees as well as provisions for repayment and liens 
in addition to customary non financial terms and conditions  our line of credit requires us to be in compliance with specified financial covenants  including i a funded debt to ebitdar ratio requirement of less than to  ii a fixed charge coverage ratio requirement in excess of to  and iii an million limitation on capital expenditures  excluding capitalized curriculum development 
at august   we believe that we were in compliance with the terms and financial covenants applicable to the restated credit agreement and its subsequent modifications 
in addition to potential obligations from our restated credit facility  we have a long term lease on our corporate campus that expires in and is accounted for as a long term financing obligation 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the past three years in thousands 
table of contents year ended august  total cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities our cash provided by operating activities declined slightly compared with the prior year and totaled million for the fiscal year ended august  compared with million in fiscal the slight decrease was primarily due to cash used to support investments in working capital  including a significant increase in accounts receivable resulting from increased sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal the use of cash for working capital investment was partially offset by improved operating results during fiscal compared with the prior year 
our primary source of cash from operating activities in fiscal was the sale of content and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures our business is not generally considered to be capital intensive and we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
our uses of cash for investing purposes during fiscal were primarily comprised of business acquisitions  curriculum development  and purchases of computer hardware  software  and other capital items used in the normal course of business 
during fiscal we used million of cash for investing activities compared with million used in the prior year 
for the year ended august  we used million of cash in connection with business acquisitions 
we paid million for the fourth of five potential earnout payments from the acquisition of coveylink worldwide  llc coveylink and million for the acquisition of ninetyfive  llc ninetyfive 
during fiscal we completed the acquisition of ninetyfive  an entity that provides sales performance training services 
the consideration for this acquisition consists of an initial million in cash payable in four installments through december  and additional potential earnout payments up to a maximum of million based on cumulative ebitda as set forth in the purchase agreement 
the remaining million liability from the purchase of ninetyfive is classified as a component of accrued liabilities at august  in addition  we have recorded the fair value of the liability for potential contingent earnout payments of million in other long term liabilities at august  however  the actual payments will be determined in future periods based on actual ebitda results 
see further discussion under contractual obligations 
during fiscal we used million of cash for the development of various curriculums and offerings 
we also used million of cash for purchases of property and equipment 
our purchases of property and equipment during fiscal consisted primarily of computer hardware  computer software  and leasehold improvements on office space at our corporate campus that we lease to other entities 
during fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million on purchases of property and equipment and million on curriculum development activities 
the significant increase in spending for curriculum development is primarily due to significant revisions to the habits of highly effective people signature program  which is our largest solution and is sold throughout the world 
the revised program is scheduled to be released in march however  actual capital spending and expected launch dates are based upon a variety of factors and may differ from these estimates 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during fiscal totaled million compared with million in the prior year 
our uses of cash for financing activities primarily consisted of million used for principal payments on our term loan and long term financing obligation  and million used to repurchase shares of common stock  including shares withheld for statutory taxes on share based compensation awards 
partially offsetting these uses of cash were million of income tax benefits from share based compensation awards and million of cash received from participants in our employee stock purchase plan 
during fiscal we announced the approval of a plan to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
we intend to use cash in excess of million  provided we have no balance outstanding on our revolving line of credit  for the purchases 
through august  we have purchased a total of  shares of our common stock for million under this plan 
we anticipate that the purchases of our common stock under this approved plan will increase the use of cash for financing activities in future periods 
sources of liquidity we expect to meet our projected capital expenditures  service our existing financing obligation  and meet other working capital requirements during fiscal through current cash balances and future cash flows from operating activities 
going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the day to day operation and potential growth of the business and may use our available revolving line of credit and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
we extended the maturity date on our restated credit agreement during fiscal to march and expect to renew the restated credit agreement on an annual basis to maintain the three year availability of this credit facility 
additional potential sources of liquidity available to us include factoring receivables  issuance of additional equity  or issuance of debt from public or private sources 
if necessary  we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the associated cost of capital 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash generated by operating activities  and availability of external funds as described above  will be sufficient for us to maintain our operations in the foreseeable future 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  macroeconomic activity  our ability to contain costs  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as general economic conditions and the introduction of new curriculums and technology by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  as described above  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations we have not structured any special purpose entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of lease payments resulting from the sale of our corporate campus financing obligation  minimum operating lease payments primarily for domestic regional and foreign office space  payments to hp enterprise services hp for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing  and distribution services  short term purchase obligations for inventory items and other products and services used in the ordinary course of business  and remaining payments associated with the acquisition of ninetyfive our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands 
table of contents fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal contractual obligations thereafter total required lease payments on corporate campus minimum operating lease payments minimum required payments to hp for outsourcing services purchase obligations ninetyfive acquisition liability ninetyfive contingent earnout payments total expected contractual obligation payments the operating agreement with fc organizational products provides for reimbursement of a portion of the warehouse leasing costs  the impact of which would reduce the lease obligations disclosed in the table above 
our obligation for outsourcing services contains an annual escalation based upon changes in the employment cost index  the impact of which was not estimated in the above table 
this obligation represents the maximum potential contingent earnout payments based on expected financial performance and the terms of the ninetyfive acquisition agreement 
actual amounts paid may differ from those presented in the table if performance objectives are not achieved 
our contractual obligations presented above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of million for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment 
for further information regarding our unrecognized tax benefits  refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting policies that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are primarily outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make assumptions and use judgments that may affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic and political conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources 
table of contents training and consulting services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in leadership  productivity  strategic execution  trust  sales force performance  customer loyalty  and communication effectiveness skills 
products we sell books  audio media  and other related products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar or delivery of the consulting services 
for product sales  these conditions are generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple element deliverables that include training along with other products and services 
for transactions that contain more than one element  we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance for multiple element arrangements using the relative selling price method 
our international strategy includes the use of licensees in countries where we do not have a wholly owned operation 
licensee companies are unrelated entities that have been granted a license to translate our content and curriculum  adapt the content and curriculum to the local culture  and sell our training seminars and products in a specific country or region 
licensees are required to pay us royalties based upon a percentage of their sales to clients 
we recognize royalty income each period based upon the sales information reported to us from our licensees 
international royalty revenue is reported as a component of training and consulting service sales in our consolidated income statements 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
share based compensation our shareholders have approved performance based long term incentive plans ltips that provide for grants of share based performance awards to certain managerial personnel and executive management as directed by the organization and compensation committee of the board of directors 
the number of common shares that are vested and issued to ltip participants in some plans may be variable and all performance based awards have vesting requirements dependent upon the achievement of specified objectives during a defined period 
due to uncertainties related to the achievement of objectives and the variable number of common shares that may be issued under some ltips  we reevaluate our ltip grants on a quarterly basis and adjust our share based compensation expense for expected vesting dates and the expected number of shares to be awarded based upon actual and estimated financial results of the company compared to the performance goals set for the award 
adjustments to our share based compensation expense are made on a cumulative basis at the adjustment date based upon revisions to the estimated vesting date and or the number of common shares to be awarded 
the analysis of some of our performance based awards contains uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and judgments about the eventual achievement of financial objectives and the number of shares that will vest in each ltip grant 
the assumptions and judgments that are essential to the analysis include forecasted sales and operating income levels during the specified service periods 
the evaluation of performance based awards and the corresponding use of estimated amounts may produce additional volatility in our consolidated financial statements as we record cumulative adjustments based on the timing and probability of vesting and or the estimated number of common shares to be awarded under the performance based grants as described above 
we have also granted share based compensation awards that have share price  or market based  vesting conditions 
for these market based awards we used a monte carlo simulation to determine the fair value and expected term derived service period of these awards 
the monte carlo pricing models require 
table of contents various inputs  including items such as grant date share price  common stock price volatility  dividend rates  and risk free return rates 
if underlying model input factors change significantly  including changes in the price of our common stock on the grant date  our share based compensation expense may differ materially from amounts recorded in current or previous periods 
accounts receivable valuation trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
our allowance for doubtful accounts calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the collectability of customer accounts  which may be influenced by a number of factors that are not within our control  such as the financial health of each customer 
we regularly review the collectability assumptions of our allowance for doubtful accounts calculation and compare them against historical collections 
adjustments to the assumptions may either increase or decrease our total allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  a percent increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts at august  would decrease our reported income from operations by approximately million 
for further information regarding the calculation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  refer to the notes to our financial statements as presented in item of this report on form k 
related party receivable at august   we had receivables from fc organizational products  an entity in which we own percent  for reimbursement of certain operating costs  such as warehousing and distribution costs  which are billed to us by third party providers  and for working capital and other advances  even though we are not obligated to provide advances to  or fund the losses of fcop 
we make use of estimates to account for these receivables  including estimates of the collectability of amounts receivable from fcop in future periods and  based upon revisions to the timing of estimated collections in fiscal  we were required to reclassify a portion of the receivable from current to long term 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  we were required to discount the long term portion of the receivables to its net present value using an estimated effective borrowing rate for fcop 
we estimated the effective risk adjusted borrowing rate to discount the long term portion of the receivable at percent  which was recorded as a discount on a related party receivable in our fiscal and fiscal income statements 
our estimate of the effective borrowing rate required us to estimate a variety of factors  including the availability of debt financing for fcop  projected borrowing rates for comparable debt  and the timing and realizability of projected cash flows from fcop 
these estimates were based on information known at the time of the preparation of these financial statements 
a change in the assumptions and factors used  including estimated interest rates  may change the amount of discount taken 
for instance  a one percent increase in the discount rate would have reduced our income before income taxes by million during fiscal our assessments regarding the collectability of the fcop receivable requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the financial health of fcop and are dependent on projected financial information for fcop in future periods 
such financial information contains inherent uncertainties  and is subject to factors that are not within our control 
failure to receive projected cash flows from fcop in future periods may result in adverse consequences to our liquidity  financial position  and results of operations 
for further information regarding our investment in fcop  refer to the notes to our financial statements as presented in item of this report on form k 

table of contents inventory valuation our inventories are primarily comprised of training materials and related accessories 
inventories are reduced to their fair market value through the use of inventory valuation reserves  which are recorded during the normal course of business 
our inventory valuation calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding a number of factors  including future inventory demand requirements and pricing strategies 
during the evaluation process we consider historical sales patterns and current sales trends  but these may not be indicative of future inventory losses 
while we have not made material changes to our inventory valuation methodology during the past three years  our inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand and other factors are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses that may have an adverse impact upon our financial position and results of operations 
for example  a percent increase to our inventory valuation reserves at august  would decrease our reported income from operations by million 
indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life and goodwill balances are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset was generated by the merger with the covey leadership center and has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is quantitatively tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars and international licensee royalties 
our goodwill at august  was generated by the acquisition of coveylink worldwide  llc during fiscal and the subsequent payment of contingent annual earnout payments  and the acquisition of ninetyfive in fiscal our impairment evaluation calculations for goodwill and the covey trade name contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to qualitatively assess the fair value of these assets  and may require estimated future cash flows  an estimated appropriate royalty rate  and an estimated discount rate that reflects the inherent risk of future cash flows when these assets are evaluated on a quantitative basis 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in future periods  significant impairment charges could result that would have an adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
the valuation methodologies for both indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are also dependent upon the share price of our common stock and our corresponding market capitalization  which may differ from estimated royalties used in our impairment testing 
based upon the fiscal evaluation of the covey trade name and goodwill  our trade name related revenues  licensee royalties  consolidated sales  and market capitalization would have to suffer significant reductions before we would be required to impair these long lived assets 
the acquisition of ninetyfive in fiscal requires us to reassess the fair value of the contingent earnout payments each reporting period 
although subsequent changes to the contingent consideration liability do not affect the goodwill generated from the acquisition transaction  the valuation of expected contingent consideration requires us to estimate future sales and profitability 
these estimates require the use of numerous assumptions  many of which may change frequently and lead to increased or decreased operating income in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over their remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values 
table of contents of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based upon discounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis  which is then depreciated or amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
our impairment evaluation calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  forecast the useful lives of the assets  and select a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we regularly evaluate our united states federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction income tax exposures 
we account for certain aspects of our income tax provision using the provisions of fasc  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon final settlement 
the provisions of fasc also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest  and penalties on income taxes  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and require increased disclosure of various income tax items 
taxes and penalties are components of our overall income tax provision 
we record previously unrecognized tax benefits in the financial statements when it becomes more likely than not greater than a percent likelihood that the tax position will be sustained 
to assess the probability of sustaining a tax position  we consider all available evidence 
in many instances  sufficient positive evidence may not be available until the expiration of the statute of limitations for audits by taxing jurisdictions  at which time the entire benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the applicable period 
our unrecognized tax benefits result from uncertain tax positions about which we are required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law and the results of tax audits by various jurisdictions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we could be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of whether valuation allowances are needed on our deferred income tax assets contains uncertainties because we must project future income  including the use of tax planning strategies  by individual tax jurisdictions 
changes in industry and economic conditions and the competitive environment may impact the accuracy of our projections 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized and determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are necessary 

table of contents regulatory compliance the company is registered in states in which we do business that have a sales tax and collects and remits sales or use tax on sales made in these jurisdictions 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations 
inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
however  future inflation may have an impact on the price of materials used in the production of training products and related accessories  including paper and related raw materials 
we may not be able to pass on such increased costs to our customers 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain written and oral statements made by us in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act of as amended the exchange act 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate  or imply future results  performance  or achievements  and may contain words such as believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  project  or words or phrases of similar meaning 
in our reports and filings we may make forward looking statements regarding our expectations about future sales growth  expected introduction of new or refreshed curriculums  future training and consulting sales activity  renewal of existing contracts  the release and success of new publications  anticipated expenses  the adequacy of existing capital resources  projected cost reduction and strategic initiatives  expected levels of depreciation and amortization expense  expectations regarding tangible and intangible asset valuation expenses  the seasonality of future sales  expectations about attracting new tenants to occupy vacant space at our corporate campus  the seasonal fluctuations in cash used for and provided by operating activities  future compliance with the terms and conditions of our revolving loan and term loan  the ability to borrow on  and renew  our revolving loan  expected repayment of our term loan in future periods  expectations regarding income tax expenses as well as tax assets and credits and the amount of cash expected to be paid for income taxes  estimated capital expenditures  and cash flow estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets 
these  and other forward looking statements  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties are disclosed from time to time in reports filed by us with the sec  including reports on forms k  q  and k 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the matters discussed in item a of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended august   entitled risk factors 
in addition  such risks and uncertainties may include unanticipated developments in any one or more of the following areas unanticipated costs or capital expenditures  difficulties encountered by hp enterprise services in operating and maintaining our information systems and controls  including without limitation  the systems related to demand and supply planning  inventory control  and order fulfillment  delays or unanticipated outcomes relating to our strategic plans  dependence on existing products or services  the rate and consumer acceptance of new product introductions  competition  the number and nature of customers and their product orders  including changes in the timing or mix of product or training orders  pricing of our products and services and those of competitors  adverse publicity  adverse effects on certain licensee s performance due to civil unrest in some of the countries where our licensees operate  and other factors which may adversely affect our business 
the risks included here are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors may emerge and it is not possible for our management to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any single factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 

table of contents the market price of our common stock has been and may remain volatile 
in addition  the stock markets in general have experienced increased volatility 
factors such as quarter to quarter variations in revenues and earnings or losses and our failure to meet expectations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the price of our common stock can change for reasons unrelated to our performance 
due to our low market capitalization  the price of our common stock may also be affected by conditions such as a lack of analyst coverage and fewer potential investors 
forward looking statements are based on management s expectations as of the date made  and the company does not undertake any responsibility to update any of these statements in the future except as required by law 
actual future performance and results will differ and may differ materially from that contained in or suggested by forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in our filings with the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments we are exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we may make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and thus are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we may make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
however  we did not utilize any foreign currency forward or related derivative contracts during fiscal  fiscal  or fiscal interest rate sensitivity at august   we did not have any amounts drawn on our revolving line of credit facility and we repaid our term loan payable to the bank in august accordingly  our long term obligations consisted primarily of a long term lease agreement financing obligation associated with the sale of our corporate headquarters facility  deferred income taxes  and the fair value of expected earnout payments from the acquisition of ninetyfive our overall interest rate sensitivity is therefore primarily influenced by any amounts borrowed on our revolving line of credit facility and the prevailing interest rate on this instrument  which may create additional expense if interest rates increase in future periods 
the effective interest rate on the line of credit facility was percent at august  and we do not currently anticipate significant borrowings on the line of credit in the foreseeable future 
our financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a long term leasing arrangement with a fixed interest rate of percent 
during the fiscal years ended august    and  we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments
