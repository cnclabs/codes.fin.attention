the of severance related charges is expected to impact approximately professional employees and reflects the changes in the company executive management team and realignment of corporate overhead as a result of the sale of the information management business 
these severance related charges are expected to be substantially paid in cash by march  pursuant to the company severance policies

severance actions impacted approximately professional employees worldwide and charges were largely paid in cash pursuant to our existing severance policy and employment agreements 
these actions were substantially completed by the end of the liability under this plan was fully settled at december  restructuring during  we initiated a restructuring plan and incurred a total charge of  consisting of of severance related charges and of facility related charges 
the of severance related charges were largely to reduce headcount and align resources to business needs and to further simplify operations to reflect the impact of the sale of the hr management line of business 
the full year severance charge of was largely paid in cash pursuant to our existing severance policy and employment agreements 
these actions affected approximately  professional employees and approximately  non salaried employees worldwide and were substantially completed by december  the facility related charge of relates to lease rent accruals and penalties for properties that have closed as the result of consolidating facilities and shifting capacity 
the charge is equal to the future costs associated with the facility  net of proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
we used estimates  based convergys corporation annual report on consultation with our real estate advisors  to determine the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
we will continue to evaluate these estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
consequently  there may be additional reversals or charges related to this facility closure in the future 
therefore  the company reviews the facility related reserves on a facility basis rather than a restructuring charge basis 
the liability under this plan was fully settled at december  savings from restructuring plans the severance actions are expected to result in cost reductions in excess of on an annualized basis when complete 
the severance actions from the and plans resulted in cost reductions in excess of on an annualized basis  largely included in results 
the impact of these benefits will be spread across our operating expenses  particularly within the selling  general and administrative expenses and cost of providing services and products sold captions of our consolidated statements of income 
when completed  the severance actions  in total  are also expected to result in cash savings in excess of on an annualized basis 
we do not believe that the impact on our overall liquidity is material 
facilities restructuring during  the company recognized of incremental facility related restructuring charges due to a change in estimate for a previously closed facility 
the company facilities restructuring reserves are equal to the estimated present value of future costs associated with the facilities  net of proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
the company uses estimates  based on consultation with the company real estate advisors  to determine the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
the company continues to evaluate these estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge

cash flow provided by investing activities was in  which included from discontinued operations  mostly related to the sale of the hr management line of business  and capital expenditures of cash flows used in financing activities were during  during and in during we repurchased shares of the company common stock for  repaid on our outstanding borrowings  and paid in cash dividends  partially offset by we received from exercise of stock options and from excess tax benefits from share based compensation arrangements 
the impact of shares repurchased on our cash flows used in financing activities does not include approximately shares of the company common stock settled for in cash subsequent to year end

during  we repaid the entire outstanding balance on our five year competitive advance and revolving credit facility and borrowed on our accounts receivable securitization facility  net of repayments 
we also repurchased our common shares for during as of december   our credit ratings and outlook are as follows convergys corporation annual report long term debt outlook moody s ba stable standard and poor s bb stable our credit ratings and outlook could impact our ability to raise capital in the future as well as increase borrowing costs 
we use free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company 
we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures net of proceeds related to disposals 
we further define adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow excluding the operating cash impact of the sale of the hr management business and the ceo transition 
a reconciliation of the gaap measure  net cash provided by operating activities  to the non gaap measures free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow is as follows computation of free cash flows net cash flow from operations capital expenditures  net of proceeds from disposal of assets free cash flows a non gaap measure payments made to settle obligations of hr management in connection with and upon substantial completion of the sale of the business payments made related to ceo transition adjusted free cash flow a non gaap measure free cash flows  as defined above  were   and for  and  respectively 
free cash flow for includes cash payments of made to settle obligations of the hr management business in connection with and at the time of the substantial completion of the sale of that business and of cash payments made related to the ceo transition 
excluding these payments  adjusted free cash flow for  and was  and  respectively 
the decrease in adjusted free cash flow of in the current year was due to lower cash generated from operating activities explained above and increased capital expenditures during the decrease from to was due to lower cash generated from activities during as a result of the timing of working capital requirements  including accounts receivable  as well as lower operating income  partially offset by the positive impact of the receipt of tax refunds of approximately in and lower capital expenditures 
adjusted free cash flow for also includes paid in connection with the refinancing of the orlando synthetic lease 
we believe that free cash flow is useful to investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations  such as investment in the company s existing businesses 
further  free cash flow facilitates management s ability to strengthen the company s balance sheet  to repay the company s debt obligations and to repurchase the company s common shares 
limitations associated with the use of free cash flow include that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it does not incorporate certain cash payments including payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions 
management compensates for these limitations by utilizing both the non gaap measures  free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow  and the gaap measure  net cash flows from operating activities  in its evaluation of performance 
there are no material purposes for which we use these non gaap measures beyond the purposes described above

under each option  amounts borrowed and repaid may be re borrowed subject to availability 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at the rates described in the new credit facility 
the new credit facility includes certain restrictive covenants including maintenance of interest coverage and debt to ebitda ratios as defined in the new credit facility 
the company s interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense  cannot be less than to as determined on a rolling four quarter basis 
our debt to ebitda ratio cannot be greater than to until december  and to after december  the new credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties 
in the event of a default  the lenders may terminate the commitments and declare the amounts outstanding  and all accrued interest  immediately due and payable 
the maturity date of the new credit facility is march  except that  upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  we may extend the maturity date by one year twice during the term 
we will pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization 
at december  the facility was undrawn 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  in  we issued a total of aggregate principal amount of new junior subordinated convertible debentures due september convertible debentures in exchange for of our unsecured senior notes due december  the entire balance of the convertible debentures was outstanding as of december  and december  during june  the company extended the terms of an asset securitization facility collateralized by accounts receivable of certain of the company s subsidiaries  resulting in a purchase limit of expiring in june the asset securitization program is conducted through convergys funding inc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
the asset securitization facility does not qualify for sale treatment under the authoritative guidance for the accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  the accounts receivable and related debt obligation will remain on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at december  and december   the facility was undrawn

based upon timing of transactions  of the shares repurchased had not settled at december  these shares are excluded from outstanding shares at the end of the year and were settled in cash during the first quarter of the timing and terms of any future transactions depend on a number of considerations including future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  financial covenants and other relevant factors

actual cash payments may vary based upon actual performance 
unrecognized tax benefits of are excluded from this table as the uncertainty related to the amount and period of any cash settlement prevents the company from making a reasonably reliable estimate 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately  bond obligations of approximately related to performance and payment guarantees  and related to performance and payment guarantees for our former hr management line of business 
upon completion of the sale of the hr management business  we continue to be responsible for these bond obligations 
although northgatearinso is obligated to indemnify the company for any and all losses  costs  liabilities and expenses incurred related to these performance bonds  the company maintains a liability of approximately we believe that any guarantee obligation that may arise related to performance and payment guarantees of continuing operations will not be material 
we also have purchase commitments with telecommunications providers of approximately for on may   we announced that our board of directors declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of per share 
the initial quarterly cash dividend was paid on july  to all shareholders of record as of june  on july   we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  which was paid on october  to all shareholders of record as of september  on october   we announced that our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share  which was paid on january  to all shareholders of record as of december  on february   the company announced that the board of directors raised the quarterly dividend percent to per share 
the dividend payment of is scheduled to be made on april  to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  the board expects that future cash dividends will be paid on a quarterly basis 
however  any decision to pay future cash dividends will be subject to board approval  and will depend on our future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  financial covenants and other relevant factors 
we intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to our shareholders  subject to our ongoing review and determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of our shareholders 
market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  we expose ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with investment grade rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which we enter into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   all of our debt instruments were fixed rate borrowings with an outstanding amount of convergys corporation annual report we had no variable rate borrowings at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we serve many of our us based clients using contact center capacity in the philippines  india  and colombia 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in philippine pesos php  indian rupees inr  or colombian pesos cop  which represents a foreign exchange exposure 
beginning in  we entered into a contract with a client priced in australian dollars aud 
as of december   we have hedged a portion of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in these foreign currencies by entering into forward contracts with several financial institutions to acquire a total of php  at a fixed price of at various dates through december  inr  at a fixed price of at various dates through december  and cop  at a fixed price of at various dates through december  and to sell a total of aud at a fixed price of at various dates through december the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december  is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the currencies above is approximately this loss would be substantially mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
other foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect the company against foreign currency exposure pertaining to receivables  payables and intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the company or the respective subsidiaries 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments in these areas based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
we have identified below the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical in compiling our statements of financial condition and operating results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
goodwill the company has recorded on its consolidated balance sheets goodwill of and at december  and december   respectively 
the december  balance reflects a goodwill impairment charge recognized in the second quarter of related to the customer interaction technology cit reporting unit 
completion of the sale of the information management business qualified as a triggering event for an interim assessment of goodwill impairment for the company information management and cit reporting units at june  based upon the purchase price for the information management business  the triggering event did not indicate an impairment of the information management reporting unit 
the sale of the information management business impacted the sale of certain products developed by the cit reporting unit and co marketed by cit and the information management business 
due in part to this transition  the fair value of the cit reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying value 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units  it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition  but instead becomes identified with a reporting unit as a whole 
as a result  all of the fair value of each reporting unit is available to support the value of goodwill allocated to the unit 
as of december   the company operated in one core business convergys corporation annual report segment as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level  one level below the business segment 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant decline in the company s stock price 
for  the company tested goodwill for the following reporting units customer management live agents and customer management cit cit 
as a result of the impairment of cit goodwill in the second quarter  only the customer management live agents reporting unit has goodwill at october  and december  as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update asu no 
testing goodwill for impairment  effective january   we first assess a range of qualitative factors including  but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and services  regulatory and political developments  entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance  when evaluating potential impairment for goodwill 
if  after completing such assessment  it is determined more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we proceed to a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit step 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value  the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any  for that reporting unit 
when required  the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
an impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot be reversed subsequently even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  fair value is based on actual stock prices or transaction prices of comparable companies 
the market approach requires significant judgment regarding the selection of comparable companies 
under the income approach  fair value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant judgment including estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
the forecasted cash flows are based upon the company s long term strategic business plan  and a terminal value is used to estimate the operating segment s cash flows beyond this plan 
the discount rate represents the weighted average cost of capital  which is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise 
both the market and income approaches require the use of significant judgments  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows 
discount rate assumptions are based upon an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows 
based on the interim results of step for the cit reporting unit  there was an indication of impairment as the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit 
accordingly  the second step of testing was performed for cit 
conclusion of step two of the impairment analysis resulted in the impairment of the entire goodwill balance of this reporting unit 
the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge net of tax in the second quarter of  included in the asset impairment caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the most recent annual impairment test performed as of october   indicated that the fair value of the customer management live agents reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying values 
despite that excess  however  impairment charges could still be required if a divestiture decision were made or other significant convergys corporation annual report economic event occurred with respect to the reporting units 
subsequent to our october  annual impairment test  no indications of an impairment were identified 
other intangible assets at december   we had a carrying value of of other intangible assets  net of amortization  consisting of in software  which is classified in property  plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets  and in customer relationships 
as amortizable intangible assets  the company evaluates the intangible assets for recoverability on an annual basis or if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amounts  by comparing estimates of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying values of the related assets 
based on the results of testing  no impairment charges were recognized in the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of was an impairment indicator  however  testing at the interim date and at december  resulted in no impairment to the other intangible assets in property  plant and equipment the cost of property  plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company reviews property  plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis 
examples of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a prolonged economic downturn  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group  or a current expectation that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property  plant and equipment asset groups  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property  plant and equipment asset groups 
if the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
various factors that the company uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such asset groups  and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in technology or development of alternative assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows 
because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property  plant and equipment asset groups  there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods 
during the second quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell our corporate office facilities in cincinnati  ohio 
accordingly  the property met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and was required to be measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
we determined the fair value was less than its carrying amount  therefore we recognized an impairment loss of after tax included in the asset impairment caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
fair value was determined based on the income approach 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and those deferred 
under us gaap  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical pre tax and taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the company s tax methods of accounting 
convergys corporation annual report the company also reviews its tax activities and evaluates uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit  which is the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining our liability for uncertain tax positions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be significantly different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgments and estimates 
restructuring charges we recognize liabilities for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
during the last three years  we recorded restructuring charges related to reductions in headcount and facility closures 
as of december   we had a restructuring accrual of  of which relates to facility closure costs that will be paid over several years until the leases expire 
the accrual is equal to the future costs associated with the abandoned facilities  net of the proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
we have used estimates  based on consultation with real estate advisors  to estimate the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
we will continue to evaluate our estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future 
other we have made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding our financial statements 
these estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans and self insurance accruals 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb  issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of testing indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the approach is similar to the guidance in asu finalized last year for goodwill impairment testing 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal year beginning after september  and early adoption is permitted 
the company adopted asu effective january  and does not expect this pronouncement to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb  issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment asu 
this asu simplifies the goodwill impairment assessment by permitting a company to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if the conclusion is that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the company would be required to conduct the current two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  it would not need to apply the two step test 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
the company adopted asu for its goodwill impairment test as of january  its adoption did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs asu 
the adoption of asu conforms the meaning of fair value between us gapp and ifrs and improves consistency of disclosures relating to fair value 
this asu requires a reporting entity to provide quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after december  the company adopted convergys corporation annual report asu effective for the year ended december  the adoption did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements
