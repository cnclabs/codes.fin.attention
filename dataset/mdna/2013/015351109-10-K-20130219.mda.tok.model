amounts in thousands  except percentages and per share data in addition to historical information  this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties  discussed in the section entitled item a risk factors  and the note regarding forward looking statements  included at the beginning of this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients with severe and ultra rare disorders through the innovation  development and commercialization of life transforming therapeutic products 
our marketed product soliris is the first and only therapeutic approved for patients with two severe and ultra rare disorders resulting from chronic uncontrolled activation of the complement component of the immune system pnh  a life threatening and ultra rare blood disorder  and ahus  a life threatening and ultra rare genetic disease 
we are also evaluating additional potential indications for soliris in severe and ultra rare diseases in which chronic uncontrolled complement activation is the underlying mechanism  and we are progressing in various stages of development with additional biotechnology product candidates as treatments for patients with severe and ultra rare disorders 
we were incorporated in and began commercial sale of soliris in soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic disorders in the therapeutic areas of hematology  nephrology  transplant rejection and neurology 
soliris is a humanized monoclonal antibody that effectively blocks terminal complement activity at the doses currently prescribed 
the initial indication for which we received approval for soliris is pnh 
pnh is an ultra rare  debilitating and life threatening  genetic deficiency blood disorder defined by chronic uncontrolled complement activation leading to the destruction of red blood cells  or hemolysis 
the chronic hemolysis in patients with pnh may be associated with life threatening thromboses  recurrent pain  kidney disease  disabling fatigue  impaired quality of life  severe anemia  pulmonary hypertension  shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark colored urine hemoglobinuria 
soliris was approved for the treatment of pnh by the fda and the ec in and by mhlw in  and has been approved in several other territories 
additionally  soliris has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of pnh in the united states  europe  japan and several other territories 
in september  soliris was approved by the fda for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with ahus 
ahus is a genetic ultra rare disease characterized by chronic uncontrolled complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy  the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body  causing a reduction in platelet count thrombocytopenia and life threatening damage to the kidney  brain  heart and other vital organs 
also  in november  the ec granted marketing authorization for soliris to treat pediatric and adult patients with ahus in europe 
the fda and ec granted soliris orphan drug designation for the treatment of patients with ahus 
on february   we acquired enobia  a privately held clinical stage biotechnology company based in montreal  canada and cambridge  massachusetts  in a transaction accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations 
the acquisition was intended to further our objective to develop and commercialize therapies for patients with severe  ultra rare and life threatening disorders 
enobia lead product candidate  asfotase alfa  is a human recombinant targeted alkaline phosphatase enzyme replacement therapy for patients suffering with hypophosphatasia hpp  an ultra rare  life threatening  genetic metabolic disease for which there are no approved treatments 
we made a cash payment of  subject to purchase price adjustments  for of enobia capital stock 
additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of  may be due upon reaching various regulatory and sales milestones 
we financed the acquisition with a combination of existing cash and proceeds from our new credit facility 
on february   we acquired patents and assets from orphatec related to an investigational therapy for patients with mocd type a  an ultra rare genetic disorder characterized by severe brain damage and rapid death in newborns 
we made initial payments of  in cash and may make additional future payments of up to  in contingent milestone payments upon various development  regulatory and commercial milestones 
on january   we acquired taligen  a privately held development stage biotechnology company based in cambridge  massachusetts  in a transaction accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations 
the acquisition was intended to broaden our portfolio of preclinical compounds and to expand our capabilities in translational medicine 
we acquired preclinical compounds and novel antibody and protein regulators of the complement inflammatory pathways 
we made an upfront cash payment of  for of taligen s equity interests 
additional contingent payments of up to an aggregate of  may be due upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones in both the united states and european union for up to six product candidates 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  business overview and summary of significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the judgments  estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  contingent liabilities  inventories  research and development expenses  share based compensation  valuation of goodwill  acquired intangible assets and in process research and development ipr d  valuation of contingent consideration  and income taxes 
revenue recognition net product sales our principal source of revenue is product sales 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations 
revenue is recorded upon receipt of the product by the end customer  which is typically a hospital  physician s office  private or government pharmacy or other health care facility 
amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities  such as value added taxes vat in foreign jurisdictions  are presented on a net basis in our statements of operations and do not impact net product sales 
in the united states  our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies which supply physician office clinics  hospital outpatient clinics  infusion clinics or home health care providers 
we also sell soliris to government agencies 
outside the united states  our customers are primarily hospitals  hospital buying groups  pharmacies  other health care providers and distributors 
because of factors such as the pricing of soliris  the limited number of patients  the short period from product sale to patient infusion and the lack of contractual return rights  soliris customers often carry limited inventory 
we also monitor inventory within our sales channels to determine whether deferrals are appropriate based on factors such as inventory levels  contractual terms and financial strength of distributors 
in addition to sales in countries where soliris is commercially available  we have also recorded revenue on sales for patients receiving soliris treatment through named patient programs 
the relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where soliris has not received final approval for commercial sale 
we record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs  including medicaid in the united states and other programs outside the united states  as a reduction of revenue at the time of product sale 
our calculations related to these rebate accruals require analysis of historical claim patterns and estimates of customer mix to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments  which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment is made 
generally  the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to six months 
we have entered into volume based arrangements with governments in certain countries in which reimbursement is limited to a contractual amount 
under this type of arrangement  amounts billed in excess of the contractual limitation are repaid to these governments as a rebate 
we estimate incremental discounts resulting from these contractual limitations  based on estimated sales during the limited period  and we apply the discount percentage to product shipments as a reduction of revenue 
our calculations related to these arrangements require estimation of sales during the limitation period  and adjustments in these estimates may have a material impact in the period in which these estimates change 
we have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the years ended december   and as follows rebates payable balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  current provisions relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in current year payments credits relating to sales in prior years balance at december  we record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue  unless we receive an identifiable and separate benefit for the consideration  and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
if both conditions are met  we record the consideration paid to the customer as an operating expense 
these costs are typically known at the time of sale  resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures resulting from portions of our forecasted intercompany revenues that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these hedges are designated as cash flow hedges upon inception 
we record the effective portion of these cash flow hedges to revenue in the period in which the sale is made to an unrelated third party and the derivative contract is settled 
we sell soliris to a limited number of customers  and we evaluate the creditworthiness of each customer on a regular basis 
in certain european countries  sales by us are subject to payment terms that are statutorily determined 
this is primarily the case in countries where the payer is government owned or government funded  which we consider to be creditworthy 
the length of time from sale to receipt of payment in certain countries typically exceeds our credit terms 
in countries in which collections from customers extend beyond normal payment terms  we seek to collect interest 
we record interest on customer receivables as interest income when collected 
for non interest bearing receivables with an estimated payment beyond one year  we discount the accounts receivable to present value at the date of sale  with a corresponding adjustment to revenue 
if creditworthiness declines further  subsequent adjustments for further declines in credit rating are recorded as bad debt expense as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
we assess on an ongoing basis whether collectibility is reasonably assured at the time of sale and we also use judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables if and when collection becomes doubtful 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including volatility associated with international economies and the sovereign debt crisis in europe  and the associated impacts on the financial markets and our business 
for additional information related to our concentration of credit risk associated with certain international accounts receivable balances  refer to the liquidity and capital resources section below 
contingent liabilities we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim  asserted or unasserted  or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation  accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information 
on a periodic basis  as additional information becomes available  or based on specific events such as the outcome of litigation or settlement of claims  we may reassess the potential liability related to these matters and may revise these estimates  which could result in a material adverse adjustment to our operating results 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the weighted average cost method 
we capitalize inventory produced for commercial sale  including costs incurred prior to regulatory approval but subsequent to the filing of a biologics license application bla when the company has determined that the inventory has probable future economic benefit 
products that have been approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities  such as soliris  are also used in clinical programs to assess the safety and efficacy of the products for usage in diseases that have not been approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
the form of soliris utilized for both commercial and clinical programs is identical and  as a result  the inventory has an alternative future use as defined in authoritative guidance 
raw materials and purchased drug product associated with clinical development programs are included in inventory and charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes and  therefore  does not have an alternative future use 
for products which are under development and have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities  purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon delivery 
delivery occurs when the inventory passes quality inspection and ownership transfers to us 
nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities  including production of purchased drug product  are deferred and capitalized until the goods are delivered 
we also recognize expense for raw materials purchased when the raw materials pass quality inspection and we have an obligation to pay for the materials 
we also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at arimf in property  plant and equipment prior to the approval of the facility by regulatory authorities 
we analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value  or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements 
although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire  which would require adjustments to our inventory values 
soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of months and  based on our sales forecasts  we expect to realize the carrying value of the soliris inventory 
in the future  reduced demand  quality issues or excess supply beyond those anticipated by management may result in an adjustment to inventory levels  which would be recorded as an increase to cost of sales 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management 
a critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements based on internal sales forecasts 
we then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand 
to the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold  we will write down the value of inventory 
if actual results differ from those estimates  additional inventory write offs may be required 
research and development expenses we accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations cro s  clinical study sites  laboratories  consultants  or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities 
related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through close communication with the cro s and other clinical trial vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules  and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed 
certain cro and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial 
the estimates are reviewed and discussed with the cro or vendor as necessary  and are included in research and development expenses for the related period 
for clinical study sites  which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter 
the estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced  which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed 
share based compensation we grant equity awards under one share based compensation plan known as the amended and restated incentive plan 
under this plan  restricted stock  restricted stock units  stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors  officers  employees and consultants or advisors of the company or any subsidiary 
stock related awards are also outstanding under other share based compensation plans  but we have not granted awards under these plans since our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the black scholes model 
the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility 
we also estimate expected term until exercise  forfeiture or cancellation  as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures 
we currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life 
actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates 
if factors change or we employ different assumptions  the share based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts 
valuation of goodwill  acquired intangible assets and in process research and development ipr d we have recorded goodwill  acquired intangible assets and ipr d related to our acquisitions 
when identifiable intangible assets  including ipr d  are acquired  we determine the fair values of the assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available  and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to timing and costs to complete the in process projects  timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals  estimated future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and discount rates 
we may also utilize a cost approach  which estimates the costs that would be incurred to replace the assets being purchased 
significant inputs into the cost approach include estimated rates of return on historical costs that a market participant would expect to pay for these assets 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur 
intangible assets related to ipr d are treated as indefinite lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets 
at that time  we will determine the useful life of the asset  reclassify the asset out of ipr d and begin amortization 
impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
in the third quarter  we recognized an impairment charge of  to write down an ipr d asset to fair value  which was determined to be de minimis 
as of december   the carrying value of our ipr d was not impaired 
if these projects are not successfully developed  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired intangible assets  including ipr d  may become impaired if the underlying projects do not progress as we initially estimated 
we believe that the assumptions used in developing our estimates of intangible asset values were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisitions 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales  development costs  profitability  or the events associated with such projects  such as clinical results  will occur as estimated 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment 
we are organized as a single reporting unit and therefore the goodwill impairment test is done using our overall market value  as determined by our traded share price  as compared to our book value of net assets 
we completed our annual impairment test as of december  and determined the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired 
valuation of contingent consideration we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date 
we determine the fair value of the contingent consideration based primarily on the following factors timing and probability of success of clinical events or regulatory approvals  timing and probability of success of meeting commercial milestones  such as sales levels of a specific compound  and discount rates 
our contingent consideration liabilities arose in connection with our acquisitions 
on a quarterly basis  we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings 
changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to discount rates  accretion of the discount rates due to the passage of time  changes in our estimates of the likelihood of or timing of achieving any development or commercial milestones  changes in the probability of certain clinical events or changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval 
the assumptions related to determining the value of contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment  and any changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that has been taken or we expect to take on income tax returns if such tax position is more likely than not to be sustained 
we follow the authoritative guidance regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which may be subject to material adjustments until matters are resolved with taxing authorities or statutes expire 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets where realization is not certain 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
if we determine that the deferred tax assets are not realizable in a future period  we would record material adjustments to income tax expense in that period 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard eliminated the current alternative to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
under the new standard  companies can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
we adopted the provisions of this standard during the first quarter of in july  the fasb issued a new standard which amends the guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill 
the new standard allows companies an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining if it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment and calculate the fair value of the asset 
under the new standard  a company is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the company determines  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not impaired 
the new standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted the provisions of this guidance for our annual impairment test 
the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 
this information has been derived from the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

the increase in treated patients was due to physicians requesting soliris therapy for additional patients  as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories and reimbursement for ahus in the united states 
we also recognized  related to an agreement reached with a payer in the second quarter of related to product shipped during the increase in revenues was offset by the negative impact of approximately  for the year ended december  due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates inclusive of hedging activity versus the us dollar for the year ended december  the negative impact was primarily due to the euro  offset by a positive impact of the japanese yen 
we recorded a gain loss in revenue of  and  related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program  which is included in revenue from outside the united states  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of sales in october  we entered into a settlement and non exclusive license agreement with a third party 
under the terms of the agreement  we made an upfront payment of approximately  in the fourth quarter of and will pay royalties on sales of soliris in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
as a result of this settlement and non exclusive license agreement  we reduced our estimate for probable contingent liabilities and recorded a gain in cost of sales of  in the third quarter exclusive of the settlement noted above  cost of sales were  and  or and of product revenue  respectively  for the years ended december  and cost of sales includes manufacturing costs as well as actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of soliris 
research and development expense our research and development expense includes personnel  facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates  as well as product development costs 
we group our research and development expenses into two major categories external direct expenses and all other r d expenses 
external direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development  product development and discovery research 
clinical development costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to eculizumab and other product candidates 
product development costs are those incurred in performing duties related to manufacturing development  medical affairs and regulatory functions  including manufacturing of material for clinical and research activities 
discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of eculizumab and other product candidates 
clinical development costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs  while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products  our product development and our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been allocated directly to each program

see table below 
increase of  in external product development expenses related primarily to the production of clinical amounts of asfotase alfa 
increase of  in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to global expansion of staff supporting our increasing number of clinical and development programs

we obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of pnh in in the united states and european union  and we made the decision to cease development of pexelizumab in the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs 
we could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated 
for additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs  please refer to item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in due to clinical development and manufacturing costs related to our expanding development programs

selling  general and administrative expense our selling  general and administrative expense includes commercial and administrative personnel  corporate facility and external costs required to support the marketing and sales of our commercialized products 
these selling  general and administrative costs include corporate facility operating expenses and depreciation  marketing and sales operations in support of soliris  human resources  finance  legal  information technology and support personnel expenses  and other corporate costs such as telecommunications  insurance  audit  government affairs and legal expenses 
the table below provides information regarding selling  general and administrative expense year ended december  year ended december  variance salary  benefits and other labor expense external selling  general and administrative expense total selling  general and administrative expense during the year ended december   we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of  an increase of  or  versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to the following increase in salary  benefits and other labor expenses of  the increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities  including increases in payroll and benefits costs of  related to our global commercial staff to support global expansion 
this increase was also due to increases in payroll and benefits of  within our general and administrative functions to support our infrastructure growth as a global commercial entity 
increase in external selling  general and administrative expenses of  this increase was primarily due to costs associated with marketing and professional services of  increased distribution costs of  increased charitable contributions of  increased occupancy costs of  due to expansion of current facilities in the united states and switzerland and new facilities associated with the acquisition of enobia  and an increase of  in other administrative costs incurred in connection with our infrastructure growth 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase  at a lower rate than our revenue  in  reflecting our continued growth as a commercial organization throughout the world 
acquisition related costs we incurred the following acquisition related costs in and associated with our acquisitions of enobia  taligen and orphatec year ended december  year ended december  separately identifiable employee costs professional fees changes in fair value of contingent consideration the following table provides information for acquisition related costs for each acquisition year ended december  year ended december  enobia taligen orphatec included in the acquisition related costs for taligen for the year ended december  is a gain of  related to the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to this acquisition 
the decrease in fair value was a result of a decreased likelihood of payments for contingent consideration due to the negative scientific findings  decrease in value and related deprioritization of the age related macular degeneration program 
impairment of intangible asset during the year ended december   we reviewed for impairment the value of an early stage  preclinical indefinite lived intangible asset related to the taligen acquisition 
we initiated such review based on our evaluation of negative scientific findings associated with our development of a different asset for the treatment of age related macular degeneration  the likelihood of success for ophthalmic use and the value that can be obtained from a market participant in an arm length transaction 
these developments led us to deprioritize the development of this acquired asset 
as a result  in the third quarter  we recognized an impairment charge of  to write down this asset to fair value  which was determined to be de minimis 
interest and other expense the following table provides information regarding interest and other expense year ended december  year ended december  variance investment income interest expense foreign currency loss total interest and other expense we recognize investment income primarily from our portfolio of cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   investment income decreased  or to  we incur interest on our term notes  revolving credit facility  and capital lease obligations 
during the year ended december   interest expense increased  to  due to interest on borrowings under our new credit facility used in the acquisition of enobia in february foreign currency transaction gains and losses relate to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of foreign currency loss  a decrease of  versus a loss of  incurred during the year ended december  the losses recorded in these periods were a result of the costs of hedging our exposures  as well as the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of  and an effective tax rate of  compared to an income tax provision of  and an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the income tax provision for is attributable to the us federal  state and foreign income taxes on our profitable operations  as well as to the tax expense of  associated with the structuring of the enobia business 
the tax provision for is principally attributable to the us federal  state  and foreign income taxes in our profitable operations 
in september  we completed our assessment of the impact the election to claim federal foreign tax credits and the federal orphan drug credits would have on our historical tax returns 
based on this assessment  we elected to claim both the foreign tax credit for the tax year ended december  and orphan drug credit for the tax years ended december  and the net federal income tax benefit recorded during as a result of the election to claim the federal foreign tax credit for and the federal orphan drug credit for and was approximately  the company was granted an incentive tax holiday in the canton of vaud in switzerland effective january   with a final expiration date in the tax holiday will exempt the company from most local corporate income taxes in switzerland through the end of and is expected to be renewed for an additional years 
the impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by  in and  in the us federal tax credit for research and experimentation expenses expired december  in connection with this expiration  our tax expense does not include any benefit from the us federal tax credit for research and experimentation 
in january  the american taxpayer relief act of  which retroactively extends the tax credit for research and experimentation back to january  through the end of was signed into law 
the effects of a change in tax law is recognized in the period that includes the date of enactment and  therefore  our tax benefit attributable to the us federal tax credit for research and experimentation will be recorded in the first quarter of we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against certain other deferred tax assets where the realization is not certain 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized

during the year ended december   interest expense increased  or  to during the year ended december   we recognized  of foreign currency loss  a decrease of  versus a loss of  incurred during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of the fluctuation in exchange rates on the portion of our monetary assets and liabilities that were not fully hedged as part of our hedging programs 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of  and an effective tax rate of  compared to an income tax provision of  and an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the income tax provision for and are principally attributable to the us federal  state  and foreign income taxes in our profitable operations 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands  except per share data the following table summarizes the components of our financial condition as of december  and december  december  december  variance cash and cash equivalents long term debt includes current portion current assets current liabilities working capital the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the net proceeds received from the common stock offering completed in may  proceeds from our new credit facility  net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and cash generated from operations  offset by cash used for the enobia acquisition  capital expenditures and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
we expect continued growth in our expenditures  particularly those related to research and product development  clinical trials  regulatory approvals  international expansion  commercialization of products and capital investment 
however  we anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash and cash equivalents should provide us adequate resources to fund our operations as currently planned for the foreseeable future 
since the commercial launch of soliris in  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through positive cash flows from operations 
we expect to continue to be able to fund for the foreseeable future  our operations including principal and interest payments on our credit facility and contingent payments from our acquisitions principally through our cash flows from operations 
we may  from time to time  also seek additional funding through a combination of equity or debt financings or from other sources  if necessary  for future acquisitions or other strategic purposes 
financial instruments until required for use in the business  we may invest our cash reserves in money market funds or high quality marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the stated objectives of our investment policy is to preserve capital  provide liquidity consistent with forecasted cash flow requirements  maintain appropriate diversification and generate returns relative to these investment objectives and prevailing market conditions 
financial instruments that potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash equivalents  accounts receivable and our foreign exchange derivative contracts 
at december   two individual customers accounted for and of the accounts receivable balance 
at december   the same two customers accounted for and of the accounts receivable balance 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including volatility associated with international economies and the sovereign debt crisis in europe  and the associated impacts on the financial markets and our business 
the credit and economic conditions in greece  italy and spain  among other members of the european union  have deteriorated throughout and these conditions have resulted in  and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries 
substantially all of our accounts receivable due from these countries are due from or backed by sovereign or local governments  and the amount of non sovereign accounts receivable is not material 
our exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in greece is limited  as we do not have a material amount of accounts receivable in greece 
as of december  and  our total gross accounts receivable in italy and spain were approximately  and  respectively 
as of december  and  approximately  and  respectively  of these amounts has been outstanding for greater than one year  and we have recorded an allowance of approximately  and  respectively  related to these gross receivables 
as of december   we recorded  of accounts receivable in spain within other non current assets  which approximates the amount of the receivables that we estimate with collection periods beyond one year 
during the year ended december  and  we have recorded expense of approximately  and  respectively  related to the expectation of delayed payment from these countries 
our net accounts receivable from these countries as of december  and are summarized as follows total accounts receivable  net accounts receivable  net one year italy spain we manage our foreign currency transaction risk within specified guidelines through the use of derivatives 
all of our derivative instruments are utilized for risk management purposes  and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes 
as of december   we have foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling  these outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of  of which an unrealized gain of  is included in other assets  offset by an unrealized loss of  included in other liabilities 
the counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are large multinational commercial banks  and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material 
at december   our financial assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value 
we have classified our financial assets and liabilities as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly through market corroboration  but substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
our level assets consist primarily of money market funds and foreign exchange forward contracts 
our level liabilities consist also of foreign exchange forward contracts 
level inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value 
our level liabilities consist of contingent consideration related to acquisitions 
acquisitions and contingent consideration obligations in february  we completed a business combination with enobia 
this acquisition required us to make upfront cash payments of  which we have paid from our available cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from our new credit facility 
in  as a result of structuring the enobia business  we recorded income tax expense of  in our income statement 
the structuring will require us to make a cash payment of approximately  in early  and this amount is fully accrued on our balance sheet as of december  the purchase agreements for the enobia  taligen and orphatec acquisitions include contingent payments totaling up to   and  respectively  if and when certain development and commercial milestones are achieved 
of these milestone amounts   and  of the contingent payments relate to development and commercial milestones  respectively 
we do not expect that any significant contingent payments will be made in the next months and  accordingly  we do not expect these amounts to have an impact on our liquidity in the near term 
as future payments become probable  we will evaluate methods of funding payments  which could be made from available cash  cash generated from operations or proceeds from other financing 
long term debt in february  we and our wholly owned swiss subsidiary  alexion pharma international s rl  entered into the credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders and other parties named in the credit agreement that provides for a  senior secured term loan facility payable in equal quarterly installments of  starting june  and a  senior secured revolving credit facility  which includes up to a  sublimit for letters of credit and a  sublimit for swingline loans 
we may also use the facilities for working capital requirements  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
any of alexion wholly owned foreign subsidiaries may borrow funds under the facilities upon satisfaction of certain conditions described in the credit agreement 
in connection with the acquisition of enobia in february  we borrowed  under the term loan facility and  under the revolving facility and we used our available cash for the remaining purchase price 
during the second quarter ended  we repaid the revolving facility in full 
in addition to the required quarterly installments of  we also pre paid  of the term loan facility during the third quarter of  and we had  outstanding as of december  as of december   we had open letters of credit of  and our borrowing availability under the revolving facility was  at december  we expect that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet debt service obligations 
contingent liabilities we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each significant matter and assess its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim  asserted or unasserted  or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to claims and litigation  accruals are based on our best estimates based on available information  and changes in the estimated amounts and timing of paying these potential liabilities could have a material impact on our liquidity 
the estimates of amounts potentially owed to other third parties may be influenced by the outcome of future litigation or other claims  if any  the results of which are uncertain 
an increase in estimated amounts owed or a requirement to pay these amounts on an accelerated basis may result in a material adverse effect on liquidity 
in october  we entered into a settlement and non exclusive license agreement with a third party 
under the terms of the agreement  we made an upfront payment of approximately  in the fourth quarter of and will pay royalties on sales of soliris in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
as of december   we recorded accrued expenses of  for probable royalties owed to third parties 
taxes we do not record us tax expense on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the businesses offshore 
we do not have any present or anticipated future need for cash held by our non us subsidiaries  as cash generated in the us  as well as borrowings  are expected to be sufficient to meet future us liquidity needs 
at december   approximately  of our cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries  a significant portion of which is required for liquidity needs of our foreign subsidiaries 
in connection with the acquisition of enobia  certain of our foreign subsidiaries have bank debt which remains outstanding at december  due to the liability position of our foreign subsidiaries  these subsidiaries will repay the bank debt  as well as any outstanding intercompany debt  prior to having excess cash available which could be used to repatriate to our entities in the united states 
while our expectation is that all foreign undistributed earnings are permanently invested  there could be certain unforeseen future events that could impact our permanent reinvestment assertion 
such events include acquisitions  corporate restructurings or tax law changes not currently contemplated 
at december   we have pre tax federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of  and  respectively 
these nol s expire between and we also have federal and state income tax credit carryforwards of  and  respectively 
these income tax credits expire between and due to the amount of our nol s and credit carryforwards  we do not anticipate paying substantial us federal income taxes within the next twelve months 
we expect to pay cash taxes in various us states and in foreign jurisdictions where we have operations and have utilized all of our net operating losses 
the tax reform act of contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayer ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of over a three year period 
we have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered during a prior year 
additionally  in connection with our acquisition of enobia  we acquired  of net operating losses subject to a limitation 
however  we believe that such limitations are not expected to result in the expiration or loss of any significant amount of our federal nol s 
common stock repurchase program in november  we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  of our common stock 
this repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
we expect that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund any share repurchases 
cash flows the following summarizes our net change in cash and cash equivalents year ended december  variance net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash generated from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and stock option exercises  offset by cash used for the enobia acquisition and repurchases of shares of our common stock

net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets and liabilities was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the  change in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to increase in accounts receivable of  due to the increased number of patients treated with soliris globally  as well as reimbursement and price approvals in additional territories 
increase in inventory of  related to increased production of inventory to support commercial growth 
increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of  primarily related to prepaid taxes and prepaid manufacturing costs 
increase of  in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities primarily related to increases in accrued income taxes  rebates and compensation  offset by a decrease in accrued royalties 
the decrease in accrued royalties was related to the intellectual property settlement 
increase of  in deferred revenue due to increased shipments in advance of recognizing revenue 
in  we expect increases in cash flow from operations which will be highly dependent on sales levels  and the related cash collections  from soliris

monthly lease payments will range from to and total contractual commitments during the minimum lease term are approximately  termination fees associated with of our current facilities total approximately  the contractual obligations table above does not include contingent royalties and other contingent contractual payments we may owe to third parties in the future because such payments are contingent on future sales of our products and the existence and scope of third party intellectual property rights and other factors described in item a risk factors and note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on form k 
the table above also does not include a liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to various federal  state and foreign income tax matters of  at december  the timing of the settlement of these amounts was not reasonably estimable at december  we do not expect payment of amounts related to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
we also did not include contingent payments related to the enobia  taligen and orphatec acquisitions  as the timing of payment for these amounts was not reasonably estimable at december  contingent payments associated with these business combinations total up to  for enobia   for taligen and  for orphatec 
we do not expect to make any significant contingent payments in the next months

operating leases our operating leases are principally for facilities and equipment 
we currently lease approximately  square feet of space at our headquarters and research and development facility in cheshire  connecticut and approximately  square feet of space at our regional executive and sales offices in lausanne  switzerland 
in addition to the locations above  we also lease space in other us states and foreign countries to support our operations as a global organization 
we believe that our administrative office space is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future 
we also believe that our research and development facilities and our manufacturing facility  together with third party manufacturing facilities  will be adequate for our on going activities 
in november  we entered into a new operating lease agreement for approximately  square feet of office and laboratory space to be constructed in new haven  connecticut 
the construction of the facility is expected to begin in and be completed in the term of the new lease will commence upon the landlord substantial completion of the building and will expire years later  with a minimum renewal option of years and a maximum renewal option of years  provided that we expand our lease to include all rentable space in the building 
the lease provides for monthly payments  ranging from to  over the term of the lease 
upon completion of the new haven facility  we will relocate our headquarters and cheshire operations to new haven 
in november  in connection with the planned construction of facilities in new haven  connecticut  we also entered into an agreement with the state of connecticut department of economic and community development which provides for a forgivable loan and grants totaling  and tax credits of up to  the program requires that we meet certain criteria in order to prevent forfeiture or repayment of the loan  grants and credits  which include i maintaining corporate headquarters in connecticut for the next years  and ii achieving and maintaining up to full time employment positions in the state of connecticut over the next years 
it is unlikely that we will be able to realize the full value of the available tax credits and we are currently exploring alternatives for the disposition of these credits 
as of december   we have not received any grant funds or tax credits associated with our agreement with the state of connecticut 
commercial commitments our commercial commitments consist of research and development  license  operational  clinical development  and manufacturing cost commitments  along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses 
the timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs  which may or may not be realized  are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans 
our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with lonza 
lonza agreement we have supply agreements with lonza relating to the manufacture of eculizumab and asfotase alfa  which requires payments to lonza at the inception of contract and upon the initiation and completion of product manufactured 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our plans for future levels of manufacturing by lonza  which depends upon our commercial requirements  the progress of our clinical development programs and the production levels of arimf 
we have various agreements with lonza  with remaining total commitments of approximately  through such commitments may be canceled only in limited circumstances 
if we terminate certain supply agreements with lonza without cause  we will be required to pay for product scheduled for manufacture under our arrangement 
under an existing arrangement with lonza  we also pay lonza a royalty on sales of soliris manufactured at arimf

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands  except per share data interest rate risk as of december   we held all of our cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts and money market funds  and we do not believe a change in interest rates would have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
in february  we entered into the credit agreement with a floating rate of interest based on libor  prime rate  federal funds rate or eurodollar rate  at our election  plus an applicable credit spread 
we do not expect changes in interest rates related to the credit agreement to have a material effect on our financial statements 
at december   we had approximately  of variable rate debt outstanding 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately foreign exchange market risk as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  japanese yen  and swiss franc against the us dollar 
the current exposures arise primarily from cash  accounts receivable  intercompany receivables and payables  and product sales denominated in foreign currencies 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural  opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses 
we have substantial operations based in switzerland to support our business outside the us  and accordingly  our expenses are impacted by fluctuations in the value of the swiss franc against the us dollar 
we currently have a derivative program in place to achieve the following limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet  using contracts with durations of up to days and hedge a portion of our forecasted intercompany product sales  using contracts with durations of up to months 
the objectives of this program are to reduce the volatility of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results and to increase the visibility of the foreign exchange impact on forecasted revenues 
this program utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce  not eliminate  the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
as of december  and  we held foreign exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling  and  respectively 
as of december  and  our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts had a net fair value of  and  respectively 
the increase in outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts resulted primarily from increases in forecasted intercompany revenues 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
the counterparties to these foreign exchange forward contracts are multinational commercial banks 
we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material 
since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities  we do not expect that a hypothetical adverse fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive net assets  which include our monetary assets and liabilities and our foreign exchange forward contracts 
the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales 
credit risk as a result of our foreign operations  we are exposed to changes in the general economic conditions in the countries in which we conduct business 
we continue to monitor economic conditions  including volatility associated with international economies and the sovereign debt crisis in europe  and the associated impacts on the financial markets and our business 
the credit and economic conditions in greece  italy and spain  among other members of the european union  have deteriorated throughout and these conditions have resulted in  and may continue to result in  an increase in the average length of time it takes to collect our outstanding accounts receivable in these countries 
substantially all of our accounts receivable due from these countries are due from or backed by sovereign or local governments  and the amount of non sovereign accounts receivable is not material 
our exposure to the sovereign debt crisis in greece is limited  as we do not have a material amount of accounts receivable in greece 
as of december  and  our total gross accounts receivable in italy and spain were approximately  and  respectively 
our net accounts receivable from these countries as of december  and are summarized as follows total accounts receivable  net accounts receivable  net one year italy spain
