overview we are a leading global high technology filtration company that develops  manufactures and markets specialized microporous membranes used in separation and filtration processes 
in fiscal  we generated total net sales of million 
we operate in two primary businesses energy storage  which includes the transportation and industrial segment and the electronics and edvs segment  and separations media 
the transportation and industrial and separations media segments represent approximately of our total net sales and operate in stable  growing markets  have high recurring revenue bases and generate strong cash flows 
in the electronics and edvs segment  we have a key presence in the more established consumer electronics market and participate in the potentially larger and developing electric drive vehicle edv and energy storage systems ess markets where lithium is the disruptive technology 
as described in more detail below  the long term growth drivers for lithium batteries are positive  but we have and may continue to experience variability in the short term as these markets emerge 
since  we have made significant investments in capacity expansion projects  all of which were funded by internally generated cash and a million grant from the us department of energy doe 
beginning in  cash flows from operations and lower capital expenditures position us to generate significant amounts of cash 
in addition  the united states federal trade commission ftc has ordered us to divest substantially all of the assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of microporous products lp microporous 
we are pursuing our legal options and at the same time  evaluating alternatives for these assets 
if we divest of all or a portion of these assets  we would intend to sell the assets at fair market value which would provide additional cash 
as we transition into a period of substantial cash generation  we intend to maintain a total leverage ratio  defined in our credit agreement as the ratio of total indebtedness total debt less cash on hand of up to million to adjusted ebitda as defined in our credit agreement and calculated in the liquidity and capital resources section  of approximately x  while also evaluating other alternatives for cash  including returning value to shareholders through share repurchases 
energy storage in the energy storage business  our membrane separators are a critical performance component in lithium batteries  which are primarily used in consumer electronics and edv applications  and lead acid batteries  which are used globally in transportation and numerous industrial applications 
we believe that the long term growth drivers for the energy storage business growth in asia  demand for 
table of contents consumer electronics and growing demand for edvs are positive 
the energy storage business is comprised of two reportable segments 
electronics and edvs 
lithium batteries are the power source in a wide variety of applications  including consumer electronics applications such as notebook computers  tablets  mobile phones and cordless power tools  edvs  and emerging applications such as ess 
demand for lithium batteries in consumer electronics is driven by the need for increased mobility 
in edv applications  demand is driven by the need to increase fuel efficiency to meet mileage standards in many countries such as the us and china  the need to reduce us emissions around the world but especially in europe due to regulations  conversion from nickel metal hydride to lithium battery technology in hybrid vehicles due to greater energy and power density  concern in developed countries and emerging markets over future access to petroleum at stable prices  smog and pollution control  and the need to address increasing transportation needs in developing economies 
since late  we have expanded capacity at our existing charlotte  north carolina and ochang  south korea facilities and built a new facility in concord  north carolina 
equipment installation for the concord facility is substantially complete and production has started for portions of the facility 
the remaining capacity at concord will ramp up over time as the nascent market for edvs develops 
although sales declined during  we expect overall demand to increase in and we believe the long term demand drivers for our products consumer demand for mobility  regulations for fuel efficiency and co emissions  conversion to lithium technology in hybrids  concerns about access to petroleum  efforts to reduce pollution  and increasing transportation needs in developing countries remain fully intact 
while consumer electronics applications have attractive long term market growth trends  edv and eventually ess applications have the potential to be much larger markets 
based on industry forecasts and industry studies  unit sales of lithium batteries for edv applications are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of greater than over the next five years 
we believe lithium battery separator growth will exceed battery unit sales growth because the trend towards larger batteries will require the use of more separator in each battery 
industry forecasts also predict edv sales to be or more of new car sales within the next five years 
if of new car sales were edvs  we believe the entire lithium battery separator market would virtually double in total size 
based on our current customer base  if only a portion of these industry forecasts materialize  we believe we will completely utilize our current production capacity 
we believe the electrification of the worldwide fleet of vehicles is just beginning  from hybrids to plug ins to full battery electric vehicles  including automobiles  buses  taxis and commercial fleet vehicles 
hybrids are selling well and regulations around the world are driving development and introductions 
new hybrids are coming to market and some high separator content vehicles have just been introduced in europe 
we believe our dry process products continue to be the preferred product in large format lithium ion batteries for edvs and ess 
we are currently working with existing and new customers on next generation batteries  which is important considering the long lead times required to become qualified for edv applications 
edv and ess are emerging market applications and are being adopted around the world in many forms 
we believe the factors that influenced our decision to expand capacity remain valid  and we continue to expect significant sales growth as the edv market develops and as ess experiences more meaningful adoption 
although the long term growth drivers are positive for these applications  short term fluctuations in demand can be expected in the early stages of adoption while initial penetration rates are low 
given the high separator content for these applications  and the potential size of these markets  small changes in end market demand can have a significant impact on our business 
transportation and industrial 
in the lead acid battery market  the high proportion of aftermarket replacement sales and the steady growth of the worldwide fleet of motor vehicles provide us with a growing recurring revenue base in lead acid battery separators 
worldwide demand for lead acid battery separators is expected to continue to grow at slightly more than annual economic growth 
the asia pacific region is the fastest growing market for lead acid battery separators 
growth in this region is driven by the increasing penetration of automobile ownership  growth in industrial and manufacturing 
table of contents sectors  export incentives and ongoing conversion to the polyethylene based membrane separators we produce 
we are meeting growing demand in this region by investing in asia and exporting from our us and european facilities 
our investments in asia have included completing three capacity expansions at our prachinburi  thailand facility  the most recent of which started production in the second quarter of  acquiring battery separator manufacturing assets and subsequently expanding our operations in bangalore  india  acquiring a production facility in tianjin  china  establishing an asian technical center in thailand  and entering into a joint venture with a customer  camel group co  ltd 
camel  to produce lead acid battery separators in xiangyang  china  primarily for camel use 
separations media in the separations media business  our filtration membranes and modules are used in healthcare and high performance filtration and specialty applications 
we believe that the separations media business will continue to benefit from continued growth in demand for higher levels of purity in a growing number of applications 
the separations media business is a reportable segment 
for healthcare applications  we produce membranes used in blood filtration applications for hemodialysis  blood oxygenation and plasmapheresis 
growth in demand for hemodialysis membranes is driven by the increasing worldwide population of end stage renal disease patients 
we believe that conversion to single use dialyzers and increasing treatment frequency will result in additional dialyzer market growth 
in late  we completed the expansion of our purema hemodialysis membrane production capacity to support future market growth 
for filtration and specialty applications  we produce a wide range of membranes and membrane based elements for micro  ultra and nanofiltration and gasification degasification of liquids 
micro  ultra and nanofiltration membrane element market growth is being driven by several factors  including end market growth in applications such as water treatment and pharmaceutical processing  displacement of conventional filtration media by membrane filtration due to membranes superior cost and performance attributes  and increasing purity requirements in industrial and other applications 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on past experience and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for additional accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are primarily composed of amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
we charge accounts receivables off against our allowance for doubtful accounts when we deem them to be uncollectible on a specific identification basis 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to judgment and estimated by management 
if circumstances or economic conditions deteriorate  we may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents impairment of intangibles and goodwill identified intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than the carrying amount 
our reporting units are at the operating segment level 
in september  the fasb amended the accounting guidance on annual goodwill impairment testing to allow companies the option to assess certain qualitative factors or use the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
the guidance states that if a company chooses the option to assess certain qualitative factors and determines  based on the assessment of qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  then the first and second steps of the quantitative goodwill impairment test are unnecessary 
however  if a qualitative assessment is performed and indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test must be performed at the reporting unit level 
when performing a quantitative two step goodwill impairment test  step one compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the income approach  corroborated by comparison to market capitalization and key multiples of comparable companies 
under the income approach  we determine fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value  then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step two calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one 
in this step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the reporting unit assets and liabilities in a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if the reporting unit had been acquired on that date 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates  strategic plans and future market conditions  among others 
there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved or changes in strategy or market conditions occur  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
in fiscal  our annual impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts by substantially more than 
pension benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement and differences between actual results and these two actuarial assumptions can materially affect our projected benefit obligation or the valuation of our plan assets 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  expected increases in compensation  mortality and turnover 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rate assumptions are based on the market 
table of contents rate for high quality fixed income investments 
at december   a decrease in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligations and the unfunded status of our pension plans by million 
the expected rates of return on our pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
for  if the expected rate of return on pension plan assets were reduced by  the result would have increased our net periodic benefit expense for fiscal by million 
at december   if the actual plan assets were reduced by  the unfunded status of our pension plans would increase by million 
environmental matters environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the availability and application of technology 
recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
in connection with the acquisition of membrana gmbh membrana in  we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations 
the reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations 
the initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition 
at december   the environmental reserve for the membrana facility  which is denominated in euros  was million 
we anticipate the expenditures associated with the reserve will be made in the next twelve months 
we have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from acordis ag acordis and akzo nobel ag akzo  the prior owners of membrana 
akzo originally provided broad environmental protections to acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to acordis successors 
akzo indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to december  which is the date that membrana was sold to acordis 
in addition to the akzo indemnification  acordis provides separate indemnification of claims incurred from december through february  the acquisition date 
we will receive indemnification payments under the indemnification agreements after expenditures are made against approved claims 
at december   the amounts receivable  which are denominated in euros  under the indemnification agreements were million 
repairs and maintenance repair and maintenance costs  which include indirect labor and employee benefits associated with maintenance personnel and utility  maintenance and repair costs for equipment and facilities utilized in the manufacturing process  are treated as inventoriable costs 
repair and maintenance costs as a percent of cost of goods sold has been consistent for fiscal  and major planned maintenance activities outside of the normal production process are capitalized as property  plant and equipment if the costs are expected to provide future benefits by increasing the service potential of the asset to which the repair or maintenance applies 
we have not had any major planned maintenance activities or capitalized significant repair and maintenance costs as property  plant and equipment in the last three fiscal years

gross profit 
gross profit was million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in consolidated gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily due to lower sales  costs associated with growth investments  including non cash depreciation expense  and costs to export lead acid separators from us and european production facilities to meet growing demand in asia 
selling  general and administrative expenses

interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal increased by million from fiscal  primarily resulting from a decrease in capitalized interest due to lower capital expenditures associated with capacity expansion projects 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income for fiscal were compared to for fiscal the income tax expense recorded in the financial statements fluctuates between years due to the mix of income between the us and foreign jurisdictions taxed at varying rates and a variety of other factors  including state income taxes  changes in estimates of permanent differences and valuation allowances 
the mix of earnings between the tax jurisdictions has the most significant impact on the effective tax rate 
each tax jurisdiction has its own set of tax laws and tax rates  and income earned by our subsidiaries is taxed independently by these various jurisdictions

net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal net sales decreased because of lower volumes and the impact of customer and price product mix 
net sales were down due to lower volumes in both consumer electronics and edv applications 
for consumer electronics  sales volumes were lower due to weakness in end market demand and capacity limitations in the prior year  which caused us to miss some sales qualification opportunities for devices being sold in the market today 
consumer electronics demand is typically cyclical and economically sensitive in the short term 
for edv applications  sales volumes declined because inventory levels built up in the supply chain in were reduced in as end market demand was less than originally premised 
net sales declined by due to changes in customer mix  as our larger  lower priced customers represented a larger percentage of total sales 
pricing for lithium battery separators is volume based  with higher volume customers receiving lower sales prices 
net sales declined by due to price product mix 
we expect overall demand for edvs to be higher in based on customer forecasts  the recent startup of new battery and edv production facilities  continued momentum in planned edv launches and the impact of the prior year reduction of inventory levels in the supply chain that is not expected to repeat during segment operating income 
segment operating income was million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal segment operating income as a percent of net sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in segment operating income and segment operating income margin was due to lower sales and the costs associated with growth investments 

table of contents since  we have completed five separate capacity expansions and added the fixed costs required to operate the new capacity  including costs to start up and qualify portions of the equipment and non cash depreciation expense of million in we completed the start up and qualification process for a portion of the capacity at our new concord production facility during the final phase of new capacity at concord will be qualified and ramped up as demand develops 
excluding the final phase of expansion at concord  we have total production capacity sufficient to generate approximately million in annual lithium battery separator sales  depending on the mix of products and grades produced 
during  sales were million  which is greater than of our current production capacity in terms of sales 
the key driver of profitability is sales and the resulting benefit of higher production volumes 
because this is a low variable production cost business  operating income and operating income margins fluctuate primarily based on production volumes and the application of fixed costs to those production volumes 
when sales volumes increase  operating income margins increase as the production cost per unit is lower due to the allocation of fixed costs to more units of production 
conversely  when sales volumes decline  operating income margins decrease as the production cost per unit is higher due to the allocation of fixed costs to less units of production 
because of this  we expect segment operating income and segment operating income margins to improve as the costs associated with our capacity expansions are allocated to more units of production as sales increase 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced headcount which will reduce operating costs by approximately million on an annualized basis beginning in we will continue to monitor and adjust our capacity and cost structure to meet expected levels of demand 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal net sales increased by million due to higher volumes  offset by million of customer mix and price product mix 
the increase in sales volume was driven primarily by growing demand for edv applications  continued growth in consumer electronics and the benefit of new capacity from the first phase of our charlotte  north carolina expansion 
pricing for lithium battery separators is volume based  with higher volume customers receiving lower sales prices 
the decline in sales relating to mix and price was due to the increase in sales to larger volume customers

table of contents foreign operations as of december   we manufacture our products at strategically located facilities in the united states  europe and asia 
net sales from the foreign locations were million of consolidated sales  million of consolidated sales and million of consolidated sales for fiscal  and  respectively 
pre tax income from foreign production facilities was million of consolidated pre tax income  million of consolidated pre tax income and million of consolidated pre tax income for fiscal  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the relationship between foreign net sales and foreign pre tax income as a percent of consolidated amounts is due primarily to the mix of operating results between segments 
the majority of sales and pre tax income from us production facilities is attributable to the electronics and edvs segment  where we primarily produce in the us for customers located in asia 
pre tax income in the us includes corporate expenses 
the majority of sales and pre tax income from foreign production facilities is attributable to the transportation and industrial and separations media segments 
in the transportation and industrial segment  we have production facilities in the us  europe and asia and generally produce in the same geographic region that we sell  though we do export some production from us and european facilities to meet growing demand in asia 
in the separations media segment  the majority of production is at our manufacturing facility in germany and sales are made to customers worldwide 
in  us operating results as a percent of consolidated amounts was lower because of a decline in sales and profitability in the electronics and edvs segment and higher stock based compensation expense in the us foreign sales and profitability increased as a percent of consolidated results as growth in the transportation and industrial and separations media segments occurred primarily outside of the us in  us operating results as a percent of consolidated amounts was higher because of an increase in sales and profitability in the electronics and edvs segment as compared to the amount of pre tax income generated by production facilities within business segments was not significantly impacted by differences in economic  regulatory  geographic or other competitive factors 
typically  we sell our products in the currency of the country where the manufacturing facility that produces the product is located 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities within such governments countries 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
seasonality operations at our european production facilities are traditionally subject to shutdowns for approximately one month during the third quarter of each year for employee vacations 
as a result  operating income during the third quarter of any fiscal year may be lower than operating income in other quarters during the same fiscal year 
because of the seasonal fluctuations  comparisons of our operating results for the third quarter of any fiscal year with those of the other quarters during the same fiscal year may be of limited relevance in predicting our future financial performance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources during  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  as cash generated from operations and cash on hand were used to fund growth investments and repay borrowings under the senior credit agreement 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  consisting of cash generated from operations of million  partially offset by a net increase in working capital 
accounts receivable and days sales outstanding were consistent with the prior year  and we have not experienced significant changes in accounts receivable aging or customer payment terms and believe that we have adequately provided for potential bad debts 
the increase in inventory was due to higher levels of raw materials and work in process finished goods 
the increase in raw materials was associated with new production capacity and the timing of bulk raw material purchases 
work in process finished goods inventory increased from days sales in ending inventory in the fourth quarter of to days in the fourth quarter of in  we were operating at high levels of capacity utilization and as a result  inventory and inventory days were low 
during  we added new production capacity and increased work in process and finished goods levels in order to maintain flexibility to meet customer needs and capture growth 
we produce inventory to meet expected future customer demand  which is based on a number of factors  including discussions with customers  customer forecasts and industry and economic trends 
inventory is generally not subject to obsolescence and does not have a shelf life  and we do not believe there is a significant risk of inventory impairment 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased primarily due to the timing of payments and lower accrued variable incentive compensation under performance based compensation plans 
investing activities 
in fiscal  total capital expenditures were million  net of doe grant awards of million 
capital expenditures were primarily related to capacity expansions in our electronics and edvs segment 
we have substantially completed our capacity expansion projects and currently estimate capital expenditures to be million in fiscal as of december   we had million of construction in progress  primarily related to the expansions in the electronics and edvs segment  portions of which will be qualified and ramped up over time as market demand develops 
financing activities 
on june   we refinanced our senior secured credit agreement with a new senior secured credit agreement 
in connection with the refinancing  we borrowed million under a new million revolving credit facility and million under a new term loan facility  the proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding principal and interest under the previous credit agreement and pay loan acquisition costs of million 
we repaid million of borrowings under the revolving credit facility in the fourth quarter of and made scheduled principal payments on debt of million in fiscal we intend to fund our ongoing operations with cash on hand  cash generated by operations and borrowings under the senior secured credit agreement 
as of december   approximately of our cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries 
there were no significant restrictions on our ability to transfer funds with and among subsidiaries  or any material adverse tax consequences that would impact our ability to transfer funds held by foreign subsidiaries to the us beginning in  cash flows from operations and lower capital expenditures position us to generate significant amounts of cash 
in addition  the ftc has ordered us to divest substantially all of the assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of microporous 
we are pursuing our legal options and at the same time  evaluating alternatives for these assets 
if we divest of all or a portion of these assets  we would intend to sell the assets at fair market value which would provide additional cash 
as we transition into a period of substantial cash generation  we intend to maintain a total leverage ratio  defined in our credit agreement as the ratio of total indebtedness total debt less cash on hand of up to million to adjusted ebitda as defined in our credit agreement and 
table of contents calculated below  of approximately x  while also evaluating other alternatives for cash  including returning value to shareholders through share repurchases 
on february   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock by december  the timing  price and volume of repurchases will be based on market conditions  relevant securities laws and other factors 
the stock repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the stock repurchase program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares  and we may terminate the repurchase program at any time 
the cash proceeds received from any potential divestiture of all or a portion of the microporous assets in piney flats  tennessee  and feistritz  austria  may be a factor in the amount of shares repurchased 
our credit agreement provides for a million term loan facility million outstanding at december  and a million revolving credit facility million outstanding at december  
at december   the company had million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility 
the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility mature in june because we intend to pay back outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility within the next twelve months  we have classified these borrowings as current liabilities 
interest rates under the senior secured credit agreement are  at our option  equal to either an alternate base rate or eurocurrency base rate plus a specified margin 
at december   the interest rate on borrowings under the senior secured credit agreement was 
under the credit agreement  we are required to maintain a maximum ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda and a minimum ratio of adjusted ebitda to cash interest expense 
adjusted ebitda  as defined under the senior secured credit agreement  was as follows in millions fiscal net income add subtract depreciation and amortization expense interest expense  net income taxes stock based compensation foreign currency loss loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment costs related to the ftc litigation write off of loan acquisition costs associated with refinancing of senior credit agreement other non cash or non recurring charges adjusted ebitda as of december   the calculation of the senior leverage ratio  as defined under the senior secured credit agreement  was as follows in millions fiscal indebtedness adjusted ebitda actual senior leverage ratio x required maximum senior leverage ratio x calculated as the sum of outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit agreement  less cash on hand not to exceed million 

table of contents as of december   the calculation of the interest coverage ratio  as defined under the senior secured credit agreement  was as follows in millions fiscal adjusted ebitda interest expense  net actual interest coverage ratio x required minimum interest coverage ratio x calculated as cash interest expense  as defined under the senior secured credit agreement  for the twelve months ended december  the senior secured credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  investments  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  prepayments of other indebtedness  liens and encumbrances  and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the agreement also contains certain customary events of default  subject to grace periods  as appropriate 
the senior notes mature on november  and are guaranteed by most of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
except under certain circumstances  the senior notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity in interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on may and november the senior notes contain customary covenants and events of default  including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  pay dividends and make investments 
future debt service payments are expected to be paid out of cash flows from operations  borrowings on our revolving credit facility and future refinancing of our debt 
our cash interest requirements for the next twelve months are estimated to be million 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements over both the short next twelve months and long term in relation to our debt service requirements 
in evaluating the sufficiency of our liquidity  we considered cash on hand  expected cash flow to be generated from operations and available borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement compared to our anticipated cash requirements for debt service  working capital  cash taxes  capital expenditures and funding requirements for long term liabilities 
we anticipate that our cash on hand and operating cash flow  together with borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
see item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
from time to time  we may explore additional financing methods and other means to lower our cost of capital  which could include equity or debt financings and the application of the proceeds therefrom to the repayment of bank debt or other indebtedness 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional debt or equity financing or a combination thereof 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
environmental matters environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding 
table of contents the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted to their present value 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations and the availability and application of technology 
we do not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity 
recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
in connection with the acquisition of membrana in  we recorded a reserve for environmental obligations 
the reserve provides for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades which are required in order for us to remain in compliance with local regulations 
the initial estimate and subsequent finalization of the reserve was included in the allocation of purchase price at the date of acquisition 
the environmental reserve for the membrana facility  which is denominated in euros  was million at december  we anticipate the expenditures associated with the reserve will be made in the next twelve months 
we have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from acordis and akzo  the prior owners of membrana 
akzo originally provided broad environmental protections to acordis with the right to assign such indemnities to acordis successors 
akzo indemnifications relate to conditions existing prior to december  which is the date that membrana was sold to acordis 
in addition to the akzo indemnification  acordis provides separate indemnification of claims incurred from december through february  the acquisition date 
we will receive indemnification payments under the indemnification agreements after expenditures are made against approved claims 
at december   amounts receivable  which are denominated in euros  under the indemnification agreements were million 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at december  some of the amounts included in this table are based on management estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  anticipated actions by third parties and other actions 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the timing and amount of payments under these obligations may vary from those reflected in this table 
for more information on these obligations  see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
payment due by period in millions total thereafter revolving credit facility and long term debt senior notes cash interest payments operating lease obligations borrowings under the revolving credit facility mature in june we intend to pay back outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility within the next twelve months 
includes cash interest requirements on the term loan facility and the senior notes through maturity in and on the revolving credit facility through the expected repayment date in 
table of contents interest rates under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility are variable and the table assumes that these rates are the same rates that were in effect at december  we lease certain equipment and facilities under operating leases 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease agreement 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options 
for leases denominated in foreign currencies  the table assumes that the exchange rate of the dollar to the respective foreign currencies is the period average rate for for all periods presented 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have long term liabilities for pension obligations of million as of december  our contributions for these benefit plans are not included in the table above since the timing and amount of payments are dependent upon many factors  including when an employee retires or leaves the company  certain benefit elections by employees  return on plan assets  minimum funding requirements and foreign currency exchange rates 
we estimate that contributions to the pension plans in fiscal will be million 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have recorded a liability at december  of million for unrecognized tax benefits 
payments related to this liability are not included in the table above since the timing and actual amounts of the payments  if any  are not known 
as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data  we have a net environmental receivable of million  consisting of an environmental obligation of million offset by the related indemnification receivable of million 
indemnification payments are received after expenditures are made against approved claims 
as a result  we expect to make environmental obligation payments and receive indemnification payments over the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  which are potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk at december   we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in our variable rate debt  we may utilize interest rate derivatives 
as of december   there were no outstanding interest rate derivatives 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt  holding other variables constant  would be million per year 
currency risk outside of the united states  we maintain assets and operations in europe and asia 
the results of operations and financial position of our foreign operations are principally measured in their respective currency and translated into us dollars 
as a result  exposure to foreign currency fluctuations exists 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
our subsidiaries and affiliates also purchase and sell products and services in various currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to cost increases relative to the local currencies in the markets in which we sell 
because the percentage of our sales in foreign currencies differs from the percentage of our costs in foreign currencies  a change in the relative value of the us dollar could have a disproportionate impact on our sales compared to our costs  which could impact our margins 
a portion of our assets are based in our foreign locations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
accordingly  our consolidated shareholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency  primarily the euro 
the dollar euro exchange rates used in our financial statements for the fiscal years ended as set forth below were as follows period end rate period average rate our strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily on conducting our operations in a country respective currency and may  from time to time  involve foreign currency derivatives 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency derivatives outstanding
