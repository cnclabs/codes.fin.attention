item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section of this report  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the largest recreational boat retailer in the united states with fiscal revenue in excess of million 
through our current retail locations in states  we sell new and used recreational boats and related marine products  including engines  trailers  parts  and accessories 
we also arrange related boat financing  insurance  and extended service contracts  provide boat repair and maintenance services  offer yacht and boat brokerage services  and  where available  offer slip and storage accommodations 
we recently implemented programs to increase our sale over the internet of used boats and a wide range of boating parts  accessories  supplies  and products  the sale of boats  boating parts  and accessories  as well as the offer of finance and insurance  or f i  products at various offsite locations  and the charter of power and sailing yachts in the british virgin islands 
none of these recently implemented programs have had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
marinemax was incorporated in january we commenced operations with the acquisition of five independent recreational boat dealers on march  since the initial acquisitions in march  we have acquired recreational boat dealers  two boat brokerage operations  and two full service yacht repair facilities 
as a part of our acquisition strategy  we frequently engage in discussions with various recreational boat dealers regarding their potential acquisition by us 
potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues  including  in some cases  management succession and related matters 
as a result of these and other factors  a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated 
we completed a relatively small acquisition in each of the fiscal years ended september    and general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results 
unfavorable local  regional  national  or global economic developments or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could reduce consumer spending in the markets we serve and adversely affect our business 
economic conditions in areas in which we operate dealerships  particularly florida in which we generated approximately   and of our revenue during fiscal   and  respectively  can have a major impact on our operations 
local influences  such as corporate downsizing  military base closings  and inclement weather such as hurricane sandy  environmental conditions  and specific events  such as the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico  also could adversely affect our operations in certain markets 
in an economic downturn  consumer discretionary spending levels generally decline  at times resulting in disproportionately large reductions in the sale of luxury goods 
consumer spending on luxury goods also may decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels  even if prevailing economic conditions are favorable 
as a result  an economic downturn could impact us more than certain of our competitors due to our strategic focus on a higher end of our market 
although we have expanded our operations during periods of stagnant or modestly declining industry trends  the cyclical nature of the recreational boating industry or the lack of industry growth may adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence has a negative effect on our business 
lower consumer spending resulting from a downturn in the housing market and other economic factors adversely affected our business in fiscal  and continued weakness in consumer spending and depressed economic conditions had a substantial negative effect on our business in each subsequent fiscal year  including to a more limited extent in fiscal and these conditions have caused us to substantially reduce our acquisition program  delay new store openings  reduce our inventory purchases  engage in inventory reduction efforts  close a number of our retail locations  reduce our headcount  and amend and replace our credit facility 
acquisitions and new store openings remain important strategies to our company  and we plan to accelerate our growth through these strategies when more normal economic conditions return 
however  we cannot predict the length or severity of these unfavorable economic or financial conditions or the extent to which they will continue to adversely affect our operating results nor can we predict the effectiveness of the measures we have taken to address this environment or whether additional measures will be necessary 

table of contents although economic conditions have adversely affected our operating results  we have capitalized on our core strengths to substantially outperform the industry  resulting in market share gains 
our ability to capture such market share supports the alignment of our retailing strategies with the desires of consumers 
we believe the steps we have taken to address weak market conditions will yield an increase in future revenue 
as general economic trends improve  we expect our core strengths and retailing strategies will position us to capitalize on growth opportunities as they occur and will allow us to emerge from this challenging economic environment with greater earnings potential 
application of critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experiences and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from boat  motor  and trailer sales and parts and service operations at the time the boat  motor  trailer  or part is delivered to or accepted by the customer or the service is completed 
we recognize deferred revenue from service operations and slip and storage services on a straight line basis over the term of the contract or when service is completed 
we recognize commissions earned from a brokerage sale at the time the related brokerage transaction closes 
we recognize commissions earned by us for placing notes with financial institutions in connection with customer boat financing when we recognize the related boat sales 
we recognize marketing fees earned on credit life  accident  disability  gap  and hull insurance products sold by third party insurance companies at the later of customer acceptance of the insurance product as evidenced by contract execution or when the related boat sale is recognized 
we also recognize commissions earned on extended warranty service contracts sold on behalf of third party insurance companies at the later of customer acceptance of the service contract terms as evidenced by contract execution or recognition of the related boat sale 
certain finance and extended warranty commissions and marketing fees on insurance products may be charged back if a customer terminates or defaults on the underlying contract within a specified period of time 
based upon our experience of terminations and defaults  we maintain a chargeback allowance that was not material to our financial statements taken as a whole as of september  or should results differ materially from our historical experiences  we would need to modify our estimate of future chargebacks  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins 
vendor consideration received we account for consideration received from our vendors in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification  revenue recognition customer payments and incentives asc 
asc requires us to classify interest assistance received from manufacturers as a reduction of inventory cost and related cost of sales as opposed to netting the assistance against our interest expense incurred with our lenders 
pursuant to asc  amounts received by us under our co op assistance programs from our manufacturers are netted against related advertising expenses 

table of contents inventories inventory costs consist of the amount paid to acquire inventory  net of vendor consideration and purchase discounts  the cost of equipment added  reconditioning costs  and transportation costs relating to acquiring inventory for sale 
we state new and used boat  motor  and trailer inventories at the lower of cost  determined on a specific identification basis  or market 
we state parts and accessories at the lower of cost  determined on an average cost basis  or market 
we utilize our historical experience  the aging of the inventories  and our consideration of current market trends as the basis for determining a lower of cost or market valuation allowance 
as of september  and  our lower of cost or market valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
if events occur and market conditions change  causing the fair value to fall below carrying value  the lower of cost or market valuation allowance could increase 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification  intangibles goodwill and other asc  which provides that the excess of cost over net assets of businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the acquisitions of bassett marine  llc and parker boat company resulted in goodwill of  in accordance with asc  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our annual impairment test is performed during the fourth fiscal quarter 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value we would recognize an impairment loss in accordance with asc as of september   and based upon our most recent analysis  we determined through our qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their carrying values 
as a result  we were not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
impairment of long lived assets fasb accounting standards codification  property  plant  and equipment impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to undiscounted future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
estimates of expected future cash flows represent our best estimate based on currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions 
any impairment recognized in accordance with asc is permanent and may not be restored 
based upon our most recent analysis  we believe no impairment of long lived assets existed at september  stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation plans following the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification  compensation stock compensation asc 
in accordance with asc  we use the black scholes valuation model for valuing all stock based compensation and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
we measure compensation for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units at fair value on the grant date based on the number of shares expected to vest and the quoted market price of our common stock 
for restricted stock units with market conditions  we utilize a monte carlo simulation embedded in a lattice model to determine the fair value 
we recognize compensation cost for all awards in operations  net of estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification  income taxes asc 
under asc  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to be recovered or settled 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized by considering all available positive and negative evidence 

table of contents pursuant to asc  we must consider all positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  including past operating results and future sources of taxable income 
under the provisions of asc  we determined that our net deferred tax asset needed to be fully reserved given recent earnings and industry trends

results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated fiscal year ended september  amounts in thousands revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses loss income from operations interest expense loss income before income tax benefit income tax benefit net loss income fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in comparable store sales 
the increase in our comparable store sales was due to incremental increases in new boat sales  partly attributable to new brands we have expanded with  and incremental increases in used boat sales  brokerage services  f i products  service  parts and accessories 
improving industry conditions resulting from improved economic conditions contributed to our comparable store sales growth 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales and incrementally increased margins on new and used boat sales due to improving industry inventory and industry wide conditions 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  to for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  the fiscal year ended september  included a recovery recognized of approximately million from the deepwater horizon settlement program for damages suffered as a result of the deepwater horizon oil spill 
excluding this item and making both years comparable  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million and as a percentage of revenue increased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  the overall increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased commissions resulting from increased boat sales and restructured commission plans  increased insurance costs related to property  casualty  liability and healthcare  increased payroll associated with improved performance and modest personnel growth  and increased promotional spending in an effort to counteract the inclement weather conditions 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  interest expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was primarily a result of lower interest rates under our credit facilities 
income tax benefit 
we had an income tax benefit of  for the fiscal year ended september  compared with an income tax benefit of  for the fiscal year ended september  our effective income tax rate was low for both the fiscal year ended september  and in fiscal  the tax benefit was primarily attributable to a favorable tax settlement with a state in which we operate 
in fiscal  we generated a loss for tax purposes and we could not record the benefit for the net operating loss carryforward due to the required valuation allowance 
for fiscal and  the income tax expense ordinarily associated with our pre tax income was offset by the fully reserved net operating loss carryforward utilized 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in comparable store sales  which was partially offset by a decline of million related to stores opened or closed that were not eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base for the months ended september  the increase in our comparable store sales was due to incremental increases in new boat sales  partly attributable to new brands we have expanded with  and incremental increases in used boat sales  brokerage services  f i products  service  parts and accessories 
improving industry conditions resulting from improved economic conditions contributed to our comparable store sales growth

interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  interest expense as a percentage of revenue increased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  the increase was primarily a result of increased borrowings under our credit facilities due to increased average inventories

for fiscal  the income tax expense ordinarily associated with our pre tax income was offset by the fully reserved net operating loss carryforward utilized 

table of contents quarterly data and seasonality our business  as well as the entire recreational boating industry  is highly seasonal  with seasonality varying in different geographic markets 
with the exception of florida  we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories  and related short term borrowings  in the quarterly periods ending december and march the onset of the public boat and recreation shows in january stimulates boat sales and typically allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related short term borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year 
our business could become substantially more seasonal if we acquire dealers that operate in colder regions of the united states or close retail locations in warm climates 
our business is also subject to weather patterns  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  prolonged winter conditions  drought conditions or merely reduced rainfall levels or excessive rain  may limit access to area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient  thereby curtailing customer demand for our products and services 
in addition  unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations 
hurricanes and other storms could result in disruptions of our operations or damage to our boat inventories and facilities  as has been the case when florida and other markets were affected by hurricanes 
although our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area  these conditions will continue to represent potential  material adverse risks to us and our future financial performance 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations  including new and used boat and related parts inventories  off season liquidity  and growth through acquisitions and new store openings 
acquisitions and new store openings remain important strategies to our company  and we plan to accelerate our growth through these strategies when more normal economic conditions return 
however  we cannot predict the length or severity of these unfavorable economic or financial conditions 
we regularly monitor the aging of our inventories and current market trends to evaluate our current and future inventory needs 
we also use this evaluation in conjunction with our review of our current and expected operating performance and expected business levels to determine the adequacy of our financing needs 
these cash needs have historically been financed with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to utilize our credit facilities to fund operations depends upon the collateral levels and compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities 
turmoil in the credit markets and weakness in the retail markets may interfere with our ability to remain in compliance with the covenants of the credit facilities and therefore our ability to utilize the credit facilities to fund operations 
at september   we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities 
we currently depend upon dividends and other payments from our dealerships and our credit facilities to fund our current operations and meet our cash needs 
as owner of each of our dealerships  we determine the amounts of such distributions  and currently  no agreements exist that restrict this flow of funds from our dealerships 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  cash provided by operating activities approximated million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to net income partially offset by an increase in inventory driven by the timing of orders and increased trade ins on new boat sales and decreases in accrued expenses and long term liabilities 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to a decrease of inventory driven by inventory order reductions and partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of our strong september close 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in operating activities was primarily related to an increase in inventory driven by new product lines added and the timing of boats received 
this was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable from our manufacturers as a result of reduced aging 
in addition  customer deposits increased as a result of large yachts that were sold on order 
for the fiscal years ended september    and  cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was primarily used to purchase inventory associated with a business acquisition and to purchase property and equipment associated with improving existing retail facilities and making capital improvements as a result of hurricane sandy and partially offset by insurance proceeds received as a result of hurricane sandy 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  cash used in investing activities was primarily used to purchase property and equipment associated with improving existing retail facilities as well as inventory purchases associated with a business acquisition 

table of contents for the fiscal years ended september   and  cash provided by financing activities was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net short term borrowings as a result of increased inventory levels and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our stock based compensation plans 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net short term borrowings associated with capital expenditures 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net short term borrowings as a result of increased inventory levels 
in june  we entered into an amendment to our inventory financing agreement the amended credit facility  originally entered into in june  as subsequently amended  with ge commercial distribution finance corporation 
the june amendment extended the maturity date of the credit facility to june  subject to additional extension for two one year periods  with lender approval 
the june amendment  among other things  also added additional lenders and modified the amount of borrowing availability  interest rate  and maturity date of the credit facility 
the amended credit facility provides a floor plan financing commitment of up to million  an increase from the previous limit of million  subject to borrowing base availability resulting from the amount and aging of our inventory 
the amended credit facility has certain financial covenants as specified in the agreement 
the covenants include provisions that our leverage ratio must not exceed to and that our current ratio must be greater than to at september   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the amended credit facility 
the interest rate for amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility is now basis points above the one month london inter bank offering rate libor a reduction of basis points from the prior amendment 
there is an unused line fee of ten basis points on the unused portion of the amended credit facility 
advances under the amended credit facility are initiated by the acquisition of eligible new and used inventory or are re advances against eligible new and used inventory that have been partially paid off 
advances on new inventory will generally mature  days from the original invoice date 
advances on used inventory will mature days from the date we acquire the used inventory 
each advance is subject to a curtailment schedule  which requires that we pay down the balance of each advance on a periodic basis starting after six months 
the curtailment schedule varies based on the type and value of the inventory 
the collateral for the amended credit facility is all of our personal property with certain limited exceptions 
none of our real estate has been pledged for collateral for the amended credit facility 
we were also a party to an inventory financing agreement the cgi facility with cgi finance  inc cgi 
the cgi facility provided a floor plan financing commitment of million and was designed to provide financing for our azimut yacht inventory needs 
the cgi facility was not renewed by the company and expired in august  however  existing advances under the cgi facility can remain outstanding for up to months 
the interest rate for amounts outstanding under the cgi facility is basis points above the one month london inter bank offering rate 
azimut yacht inventory is now financed under the amended credit facility 
as of september  and  our indebtedness associated with financing our inventory and working capital needs totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
at september  and  the interest rate on the outstanding short term borrowings was approximately and 
at september   our additional available borrowings under our amended credit facility were approximately million based upon the outstanding borrowing base availability 
the aging of our inventory limits our borrowing capacity as defined curtailments reduce the allowable advance rate as our inventory ages 
on october   the company paid off the entire cgi facility by refinancing such amounts owed under the amended credit facility 
except as specified in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  and results of operations and in our consolidated financial statements  we have no material commitments for capital for the next months 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months  except for possible significant acquisitions 

table of contents contractual commitments and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  year ending september  short term borrowings long term liabilities operating leases total amounts in thousands thereafter total estimates of future interest payments for short term borrowings have been excluded in the tabular presentation 
amounts due are contingent upon the outstanding balances and the variable interest rates 
as of september   the interest rate on our short term borrowings was approximately 
the amounts included in long term liabilities consist primarily of gross unrecognized tax benefits and our estimated liability for claims on certain workers compensation insurance policies 
while we estimate the amount to be paid in excess of months  the ultimate timing of the payments is subject to certain variability 
accordingly  we have classified all amounts as due in the following year for the purposes of this table 
amounts for operating lease commitments do not include certain operating expenses such as maintenance  insurance  and real estate taxes 
these amounts are not a material component of operating expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our financial condition  liquidity  or capital resources 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support  we do not engage in hedging  or research and development services  and we do not have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   all of our short term debt bore interest at a variable rate  tied to libor as a reference rate 
changes in the underlying libor interest rate on our short term debt could affect our earnings 
for example  a hypothetical basis point increase in the interest rate on our short term debt would result in an increase of approximately million in annual pre tax interest expense 
this estimated increase is based upon the outstanding balance of our short term debt as of september  and assumes no mitigating changes by us to reduce the outstanding balances and no additional interest assistance that could be received from vendors due to the interest rate increase 
products purchased from european based and chinese based manufacturers are subject to fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate  which ultimately may impact the retail price at which we can sell such products 
accordingly  fluctuations in the value of the other currencies compared with the us dollar may impact the price points at which we can profitably sell such foreign products  and such price points may not be competitive with other product lines in the united states 
accordingly  such fluctuations in exchange rates ultimately may impact the amount of revenue  cost of goods sold  cash flows  and earnings we recognize for such foreign product lines 
we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
in certain cases  we may enter into foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted purchases of boats and yachts from european based and chinese based manufacturers 
we are not currently engaged in foreign currency exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure 
if and when we do engage in foreign currency exchange hedging transactions  we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations
