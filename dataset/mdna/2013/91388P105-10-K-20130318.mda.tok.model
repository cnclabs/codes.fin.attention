item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading asset light provider of customized transportation and logistics solutions throughout the united states  mexico and canada 
in october  we acquired linc logistics company linc 
universal and linc were under common control  and as such  the financial statements of universal have been retrospectively revised to reflect the accounts of linc as if they had been consolidated for all previous periods 
the acquisition significantly enhanced our position as a leading provider of third party transportation  value added and intermodal services 
we provide a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics solutions that allow our customers and clients to reduce costs and manage their global supply chains more efficiently 
we market our services through a direct sales and marketing network focused on selling our portfolio of transportation logistic services to large customers in specific industry sectors  through a contract network of agents who solicit freight business directly from shippers  and through company managed terminals and full service freight forwarding and customs house brokerage offices 
our network of agents and owner operators is located throughout the united states and in the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec  and we operate  manage or provide transportation services at logistics locations in the united states  mexico and canada 
facilities are located inside customer plants or distribution operations  the other facilities are generally located close to our customers plants to optimize the efficiency of their component supply chains and production processes 
our facilities and services are often directly integrated into the production processes of our customers and represent a critical piece of their supply chains 
to support our asset light business model  we generally try to coordinate the length of real estate leases associated with our value added services with the end date of the related customer contract associated with such facility  or use month to month leases  in order to mitigate exposure to unrecovered lease costs 
we offer our customers a wide range of transportation services by utilizing a diverse fleet of tractors and trailing equipment provided by us  our owner operators and third party transportation companies 
our owner operators provided us with approximately  tractors and  trailers 
we own approximately tractors   trailers  chassis and containers 
our agents and owner operators are independent contractors who earn a fixed commission calculated as a percentage of the revenue or gross profit they generate for us and who bring an entrepreneurial spirit to our business 
our transportation services are provided through a network of both union and non union employee drivers  owner operators  contract drivers  and third party transportation companies 
we employ  people in the united states  mexico and canada  including employees subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we also engaged staffing contract vendors to supply an average of  additional personnel on a full time equivalent basis 
our use of agents  owner operators  third party providers and contract staffing vendors allows us to maintain both a highly flexible cost structure and a scalable business operation  while reducing investment requirements 
these benefits are passed on to our customers in the form of cost savings and increased operating efficiency  while enhancing our cash generation and the returns on our invested capital and assets 
we believe that our flexible business model also offers us substantial opportunities to grow through a mixture of organic growth and acquisitions 
we intend to continue our organic growth by recruiting new agents and owner operators  expanding into new industry verticals and targeting further penetration of our key customers 
we believe our integrated suite of transportation and logistics services  our network of facilities in the united states  mexico and canada  our long term customer relationships and our reputation for operational excellence will allow us to capitalize on these growth opportunities 
we also expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions of companies that complement our asset light business model  as well as companies that derive a portion of their revenues from asset based operations 

table of contents in january  we acquired cavalry transportation  llc and cavalry logistics  llc  or cavalry  based in nashville  tennessee  for approximately million 
cavalry offers fully integrated transportation resources designed to maximize value for its customers through logistic solutions in intermodal  truckload  and less than truckload transportation options 
cavalry operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of universal truckload services  inc in january  we acquired certain assets of tsd transportation lp  or tsd  based in texarkana  texas  for approximately million 
included in the purchase price was approximately million of additional consideration estimated to be paid to the former owners of tsd based on a percentage of revenues generated through december  tsd operates as part of louisiana transportation  inc in march  we acquired certain assets of hart transportation  inc  or hart  based in jacksonville  florida for approximately million 
hart is primarily a regional provider of van and flatbed services throughout the southeastern united states 
included in the purchase price is approximately million of additional consideration estimated to be paid to the former owner of hart based on a percentage of revenues generated through march  hart operates as part of universal am can  ltd 
factors affecting our revenues operating revenues 
we generate substantially all of our revenues through fees charged to customers for the transportation of freight and for the customized logistics services we provide 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  where separately identifiable  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  container management and storage and other related services 
our agreements with customers typically follow one of two patterns transactional or contractual 
transactional agreements are associated with individual freight shipments coordinated by our agents  company managed terminals and specialized services operations 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our transportation and intermodal drayage services 
contractual agreements are for the delivery of value added services or transportation services that are on an exclusive basis 
the pricing structure of value added services contracts  which often are three to five years in duration  compensate for the physical resources and labor that support material handling  sequencing  sub assembly and various other value added processes  including both variable cost and fixed price components 
transportation services which are contractual typically have a term of one year 
fees charged to customers by our full service international freight forwarding and customs house brokerage are based on the specific means of forwarding or delivering freight on a shipment by shipment basis 
our transportation revenues are primarily influenced by fluctuations in freight volumes and shipping rates 
the main factors that affect these are competition  available truck capacity  and economic market conditions 
our value added contract business is substantially driven by the level of demand for outsourced logistics services 
major factors that affect our revenues include changes in manufacturing supply chain requirements  production levels in specific industries  pricing trends due to levels of competition and resource costs in logistics and transportation  and economic market conditions 
we recognize revenue on a gross basis at the time that persuasive evidence of an arrangement with our customer exists  sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
our revenue is recognized at the time of delivery to the receiver s location  or for service arrangements  after the related services have been rendered 
factors affecting our expenses purchased transportation and equipment rent 
purchased transportation and equipment rent represents the amounts we pay to our owner operators or other third party equipment providers to haul freight and  to the extent required to deliver certain logistics services  the cost of equipment leased under short term contracts from third parties 
the amount of the purchased transportation we pay to our owner operators is primarily based on a 
table of contents contractually agreed upon percentage of our revenue for each load hauled 
the expense also includes the amount of fuel surcharges  where separately identifiable  that we receive from our customers and pass through to our owner operators 
our strategy is to maintain a highly flexible business model that employs a cost structure that is mostly variable in nature 
as a result  purchased transportation and equipment rent is the largest component of our costs and increases or decreases proportionately with changes in the amount of revenue generated by our owner operators and other third party providers and with the production volumes of our customers 
we recognize purchased transportation and equipment rent as the services are provided 
direct personnel and related benefits 
direct personnel and related benefits include the salaries  wages and fringe benefits of our employees  as well as costs related to contract labor utilized in operating activities 
these costs are a significant component of our cost structure and increase or decrease proportionately with the expansion  addition or closing of operating facilities 
as of december   approximately of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements 
any changes in union agreements will affect our personnel and related benefits cost 
the operations in the united states and canada that are subject to collective bargaining agreements have separate  individualized agreements with several different unions that represent employees in these operations 
while there are some facilities with multiple unions  each collective bargaining agreement with each union covers a single facility for that union 
such agreements have expiration dates that are generally independent of other collective bargaining agreements and include economics and operating terms tailored to the specific operational requirements of a customer 
our operation in mexico provides competitive compensation within the mexican statutory framework for managerial and supervisory personnel 
commission expense 
commission expense represents the amount we pay our agents for generating shipments on our behalf 
the commissions we pay to our agents are generally established through informal oral agreements and are based on a percentage of revenue or gross profit generated by each load hauled 
traditionally  commission expense increase or decrease in proportion to the revenues generated through our agents 
we recognize commission expenses at the time we recognize the associated revenue 
operating expense exclusive of items shown separately 
these expenses include items such as fuel  tires and parts repair items primarily related to the maintenance of company owned leased tractors  trailers and lift equipment  as well as licenses  dock supplies  communication  utilities  operating taxes and other general operating expenses 
we also receive rental income by leasing our trailers to owner operators 
these expenses are presented net of rental income 
because we maintain a flexible business model  our operating expenses exclusive of items shown separately generally relate to equipment utilization  fluctuations in customer demand and the related impact on our operating capacity 
our transportation services provided by company owned equipment depend on the availability and pricing of diesel fuel 
although we often include fuel surcharges in our billing to customers to offset increases in fuel costs  other operating costs have been  and may continue to be  impacted by fluctuating fuel prices 
we recognize these expenses as they are incurred and the rental income as it is earned 
occupancy expense 
occupancy expense includes all costs related to the lease and tenancy of terminals and operating facilities  except utilities  unless such costs are otherwise covered by our customers 
although occupancy expense is generally related to fluctuations in overall customer demand  our contracting and pricing strategies help mitigate the cost impact of changing production volumes 
to minimize potential exposure to inactive or underutilized facilities that are dedicated to a single customer  we strive where possible to enter into lease agreements that are coterminous with individual customer contracts  and we seek contract pricing terms that recover fixed occupancy costs  regardless of production volume 
occupancy expense may also includes certain lease termination and related occupancy costs that are accelerated for accounting purposes into the fiscal year in which such a decision was implemented 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense includes the salaries  wages and benefits of sales and administrative personnel  related support costs  taxes other than income and property taxes  adjustments due to foreign currency transactions  bad debt expense  and other general expenses  including gains or losses on the sale or disposal of assets 
these expenses are generally not directly related to 
table of contents levels of operating activity and may contain non recurring or one time expenses related to general business operations 
we recognize selling  general and administrative expense when it is incurred 
insurance and claims 
insurance and claims expense represents our insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts 
our insurance premiums are generally calculated based on a mixture of a percentage of line haul revenue and the size of our fleet 
our accruals have primarily related to cargo and property damage claims 
we may also make accruals for personal injuries and property damage to third parties  physical damage to our equipment  general liability and workers compensation claims if we experience a claim in excess of our insurance coverage 
to reduce our exposure to non trucking use liability claims claims incurred while the vehicle is being operated without a trailer attached or is being operated with an attached trailer which does not contain or carry any cargo  we require our owner operators to maintain non trucking use liability coverage  which we refer to as deadhead bobtail coverage  of million per occurrence 
our exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by other third party providers who haul freight on our behalf is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
our insurance expense varies primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience  insurance rates  our coverage limits and our self insured retention amounts 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to the depreciation of owned tractors  trailers  computer and operating equipment  and buildings as well as the amortization of the intangible assets recorded for our acquired customer and agent relationships 
we estimate the salvage value and useful lives of depreciable assets based on current market conditions and experience with past dispositions 
results of operations in prior periods  we presented our individual operating segments as one reportable segment 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired linc and  on december   our board appointed a new chief executive officer  who has the responsibility to allocate resources and to assess the performance of our operating segments 
certain integration activities in connection with our organizational design and our financial reporting system were not concluded as of december  we concluded that linc should be reported separately from the operating segments that pre dated the linc acquisition 
linc s operating revenues increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by increasing demand for value added services at both new and existing customers  which was partially offset by decreases in our transportation volumes

as a result  our capital expenditure requirements are limited in comparison to most large transportation and logistics service providers  which maintain significant properties and sizable fleets of owned tractors and trailers 
in  our capital expenditures totaled million 
these expenditures primarily consisted of transportation equipment and investments in support of new value added service operations  including the expansion in the scope of services we provide in san luis potos  mexico 
our asset light business model depends somewhat on the customized solutions we implement for specific customers 
as a result  our capital expenditures will depend on specific new contracts and the overall age and condition of our owned transportation equipment 
in  exclusive of acquisitions of businesses  we expect to incur capital expenditures in the range of to of operating revenues for the acquisition of transportation equipment  to support our value added service operations and for the acquisition of real property acquisitions and improvements to our existing terminal yard and container facilities 
on october   we completed the acquisition of linc 
in connection with the acquisition  at closing we borrowed approximately million to repay linc s outstanding indebtedness and dividends payable
