shapell was founded in as a home construction company that built custom quality single family home communities in southern california 
shapell designs  constructs and markets single family detached and attached homes and develops land in master planned communities and neighborhoods throughout coastal northern and southern california 
shapell s revenues from home building totaled million  million  million and million for   and the eight month period ended august   respectively 
shapell has delivered over  homes and built over  apartments since shapell s home building operation has active selling communities concentrated in locations 
it is organized in two geographic regions  northern california and southern california  within which it is focused on a select number of premium markets 
following the closing of the acquisition  we expect to selectively sell approximately million of assets to reduce land concentration and outstanding borrowings  however  the timing and size of any asset sale transactions will be dependent on market and other factors  some of which are outside of our control 
we make no assurance that we will be able to complete asset sale transactions on attractive terms or at all 
our challenging business environment and current outlook we believe that  in fiscal  the housing market began to recover from the significant slowdown that started in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended october  during fiscal and the first nine months of fiscal  we saw a strong recovery in the number and value of new sales contracts signed 
our net contracts signed in fiscal and  as compared to fiscal  increased approximately and  respectively  in the number of net contracts signed and and  respectively  in the value of net contracts signed 
although the number and value of fiscal and net contracts signed increased over fiscal  they were still significantly below what we recorded in fiscal we have witnessed a leveling of demand which began in the fourth quarter of our fiscal and has continued into fiscal we believe this to be a temporary pause triggered by a rapid rise in interest rates and home prices and uncertainty from the political discord in washington 
we are still affected by the downturn in the housing market 
we believe the downturn started with a decline in consumer confidence  an overall softening of demand for new homes and an oversupply of homes available for sale 
the downturn was exacerbated by  among other things  a decline in the overall economy  increased unemployment  the large number of homes that were vacant and homes that had been foreclosed on due to the economic downturn  a fear of job loss  a decline in home prices and the resulting reduction in home equity  the inability of some of our home buyers  or some prospective buyers of their homes  to sell their current homes  the deterioration in the credit markets  and the direct and indirect impact of the turmoil in the mortgage loan market 
we believe that  as the national unemployment rate declines and confidence improves  pent up demand will begin to be released 
we believe that the demographics of the move up  empty nester  active adult  age qualified and second home upscale markets will provide us with the potential for growth in the coming decade 
according to the us census bureau  the number of households earning  or more in constant dollars at september stood at million  or approximately of all us households 
this group has grown at three times the rate of increase of all us households since according to harvard university june the state of the nation housing  the growth and aging of the current population  assuming the economic recovery is sustained over the next few years  supports the addition of about new household formations per year during the next decade 
according to the us census bureau  during the period through  total housing starts in the united states averaged approximately million per year  while in the period through  total housing starts averaged approximately million per year 
in addition  based on the trend of household formations in relation to population growth during the period through  the number of households formations formed in the four year period of through was approximately million less than would have been expected 
in the downturn  in many markets  the pipeline of approved and improved home sites dwindled as many builders and developers lacked both the capital and the economic benefit for bringing sites through approvals 
therefore  we believe that  as demand continues to strengthen  builders and developers with approved land in well located markets will be poised to benefit 
we believe that this will be particularly true for us because our land portfolio is heavily weighted in the metro washington  dc to metro boston corridor where land is scarce  approvals are more difficult to obtain and overbuilding has been relatively less prevalent than in the southeast and western regions 
we continue to believe that many of our communities are in desirable locations that are difficult to replace and in markets where approvals have been increasingly difficult to achieve 
we believe that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future as the housing recovery strengthens 
competitive landscape based on our experience during prior downturns in the housing industry  we believe that attractive land acquisition opportunities arise in difficult times for those builders that have the financial strength to take advantage of them 
in the current environment  we believe our strong balance sheet  liquidity  access to capital  broad geographic presence  diversified product line  experienced personnel  and national brand name all position us well for such opportunities now and in the future 
we continue to see reduced competition from the small and mid sized private builders that had been our primary competitors in the luxury market 
we believe that many of these builders are no longer in business and that access to capital by the remaining private builders is already severely constrained 
we envision that there are fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry as the market rebounds and that those lenders likely will gravitate to the home building companies that offer them the greatest security  the strongest balance sheets and the broadest array of potential business opportunities 
while some builders may re emerge with new capital  the scarcity of attractive land is a further impediment to their re emergence 
we believe that reduced competition  combined with attractive long term demographics  will reward those well capitalized builders that can persevere through the current challenging environment 
we believe that geographic and product diversification  access to lower cost capital and strong demographics benefit those builders  like us  who can control land and persevere through the increasingly difficult regulatory approval process 
we believe that these factors favor a large publicly traded home building company with the capital and expertise to control home sites and gain market share 
we also believe that over the past five years  many builders and land developers reduced the number of home sites that were taken through the approval process 
the process continues to be difficult and lengthy  and the political pressure from no growth proponents continues to increase  but we believe our expertise in taking land through the approval process and our already approved land positions will allow us to grow in the years to come as market conditions improve 
land acquisition and development because of the length of time that it takes to obtain the necessary approvals on a property  complete the land improvements on it  and deliver a home after a home buyer signs an agreement of sale  we are subject to many risks 
in certain cases  we attempt to reduce some of these risks by utilizing one or more of the following methods controlling land for future development through options also referred to herein as land purchase contracts or option and purchase agreements  thus allowing the necessary governmental approvals to be obtained before acquiring title to the land  generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer  and using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed price basis 
in response to the decline in market conditions over the past several years  we re evaluated and renegotiated or canceled many of our land purchase contracts 
in addition  we sold  and may continue to sell  certain parcels of land that we identified as non strategic 
as a result  we reduced our land position from a high of approximately  home sites at april  to a low of approximately  home sites at january  based on our belief that the housing market has begun to recover  the increased attractiveness of land available for purchase and the revival of demand in certain areas  we have begun to increase our land positions 
during fiscal and  we acquired control of approximately  home sites net of options terminated and  home sites net of options terminated  respectively 
in november  we agreed to acquire all of the equity interests in the single family residential real property development business of shapell  including a portfolio of approximately  home sites in california 
see overview acquisition in this md a for more information about the shapell acquisition 
at october   we controlled approximately  home sites of which we owned approximately  significant improvements were completed on approximately  of the  home sites 
at october   we were selling from communities  compared to at october  and communities at october  we expect to be selling from to communities at october  at october   we had communities that were temporarily closed due to market conditions and that we do not expect to re open in fiscal availability of customer mortgage financing we maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions  many of which are among the largest and  we believe  most reliable in the industry 
we believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long term value in creating relationships with high quality  affluent customers such as our home buyers  and these banks continue to provide such customers with financing 
we believe that our home buyers generally are  and should continue to be  better able to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan to value ratios and attractive credit profiles as compared to the average home buyer 
nevertheless  in recent years  tightened credit standards have shrunk the pool of potential home buyers and hindered accessibility of or eliminated certain loan products previously available to our home buyers 
our home buyers continue to face stricter mortgage underwriting guidelines  higher down payment requirements and narrower appraisal guidelines than in the past 
in addition  some of our home buyers continue to find it more difficult to sell their existing homes as prospective buyers of their homes may face difficulties obtaining a mortgage 
in addition  other potential buyers may have little or negative equity in their existing homes and may not be able or willing to purchase a larger or more expensive home 
while the range of mortgage products available to a potential home buyer is not what it was in the period through  we have seen improvements over the past several years 
indications from industry participants  including commercial banks  mortgage banks  mortgage real estate investment trusts and mortgage insurance companies are that availability  parameters and pricing of jumbo loans are all improving 
we believe that improvement should not only enhance financing alternatives for existing jumbo buyers  but also help to offset the reduction in fannie mae freddie mac eligible loan amounts in some markets 
based on the mortgages provided by our mortgage subsidiary  we do not expect the change in the fannie mae freddie mac eligible loan amounts to have a significant impact on our business 
there has been significant media attention given to mortgage put backs  a practice by which a buyer of a mortgage loan tries to recoup losses from the loan originator 
we do not believe this is a material issue for our mortgage subsidiary 
of the approximately  loans sold by our mortgage subsidiary since november   only have been the subject of either actual indemnification payments or take backs or contingent liability loss provisions related thereto 
we believe that this is due to i our typical home buyer financial position and sophistication  ii on average  our home buyers who use mortgage financing to purchase a home pay approximately of the purchase price in cash  iii our general practice of not originating certain loan types such as option adjustable rate mortgages and down payment assistance products  and our origination of few sub prime and high loan to value no documentation loans  iv our elimination of early payment default provisions from each of our agreements with our mortgage investors several years ago  and v the quality of our controls  processes and personnel in our mortgage subsidiary 
we have entered into two agreements with investors that contain limited early payment default provisions 
at october   we had not sold any loans under these agreements 
we believe that these limited early payment default provisions will not expose us to a significant risk 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act provides for a number of new requirements relating to residential mortgage lending practices 
these include  among others  minimum standards for mortgages and related lender practices  the definitions and parameters of a qualified mortgage and a qualified residential mortgage  future risk retention requirements  limitations on certain fees  prohibition of certain tying arrangements  and remedies for borrowers in foreclosure proceedings in the event that a lender violates fee limitations or minimum standards 
we do not believe that the effect of these requirements on our mortgage subsidiary will be significant  although it will restrict us from providing a comprehensive package of services to our home buyer due to fee restrictions imposed upon our home buyers as to what they are permitted to pay to our affiliated businesses 
gibraltar we continue to look for distressed real estate opportunities through gibraltar 
gibraltar continues to selectively review new opportunities  including bank portfolios and other distressed real estate investments 
in fiscal  gibraltar acquired four loans directly and invested in a loan participation for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the loans are secured by retail shopping centers  residential land and golf courses located in seven states 
at october   gibraltar had investments in distressed loans of approximately million  investments in foreclosed real estate of million and an investment in a structured asset joint venture of million 
in fiscal  and  we recognized income  including its equity in the earnings from its investment in a structured asset joint venture  of million  million and million from the gibraltar operations  respectively 
toll brothers apartment living toll brothers campus living over the past several years  we have acquired control of a number of land parcels as for rent apartment projects  including two student housing sites  totaling approximately  units 
these projects  which are located in the metro boston to metro washington  dc corridor  are being developed or will be developed with partners under the brand names toll brothers apartment living and toll brothers campus living 
a number of these sites had been acquired by us as part of a larger purchase or were originally acquired to develop as for sale homes 
of the  planned units   are owned by joint ventures in which we have a interest  approximately  are owned by us   of them are under contract to be purchased  and of them are under letters of intent 
through the trust  we also have interests in approximately  operating apartment units in the washington  dc area and in princeton junction  nj

the increase in the number of net contracts signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the continued recovery in the us housing market in fiscal and the reduced competition from the small and mid sized private builders that had been our primary competitors in the luxury market 
the increase in the average value of each contract signed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to a change in mix of contracts signed to more expensive areas  higher priced products  increased prices and reduced incentives given on new contracts signed

critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventory is stated at cost unless an impairment exists  in which case it is written down to fair value in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition to direct land acquisition  land development and home construction costs  costs also include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead related to development and construction  which are capitalized to inventory during periods beginning with the commencement of development and ending with the completion of construction 
for those communities that have been temporarily closed  no additional capitalized interest is allocated to the community s inventory until it re opens  and other carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
once a parcel of land has been approved for development and we open the community  it can typically take four or more years to fully develop  sell and deliver all the homes in that community 
longer or shorter time periods are possible depending on the number of home sites in a community and the sales and delivery pace of the homes in a community 
our master planned communities  consisting of several smaller communities  may take up to ten years or more to complete 
because our inventory is considered a long lived asset under gaap  we are required to regularly review the carrying value of each of our communities and write down the value of those communities when we believe the values are not recoverable 
current communities when the profitability of a current community deteriorates  the sales pace declines significantly or some other factor indicates a possible impairment in the recoverability of the asset  the asset is reviewed for impairment by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flow for the community to its carrying value 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flow is less than the community s carrying value  the carrying value is written down to its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is primarily determined by discounting the estimated future cash flow of each community 
the impairment is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the impairment is determined 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flow of a community  we use various estimates such as i the expected sales pace in a community  based upon general economic conditions that will have a short term or long term impact on the market in which the community is located and on competition within the market  including the number of home sites available and pricing and incentives being offered in other communities owned by us or by other builders  ii the expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered in a community  iii costs expended to date and expected to be incurred in the future  including  but not limited to  land and land development costs  home construction costs  interest costs and overhead costs  iv alternative product offerings that may be offered in a community that will have an impact on sales pace  sales price  building cost or the number of homes that can be built in a particular community  and v alternative uses for the property  such as the possibility of a sale of the entire community to another builder or the sale of individual home sites 
future communities we evaluate all land held for future communities or future sections of current communities  whether owned or optioned  to determine whether or not we expect to proceed with the development of the land as originally contemplated 
this evaluation encompasses the same types of estimates used for current communities described above  as well as an evaluation of the regulatory environment in which the land is located and the estimated probability of obtaining the necessary approvals  the estimated time and cost it will take to obtain those approvals and the possible concessions that will be required to be given in order to obtain them 
concessions may include cash payments to fund improvements to public places such as parks and streets  dedication of a portion of the property for use by the public or as open space or a reduction in the density or size of the homes to be built 
based upon this review  we decide i as to land under contract to be purchased  whether the contract will likely be terminated or renegotiated  and ii as to land we own  whether the land will likely be developed as contemplated or in an alternative manner  or should be sold 
we then further determine whether costs that have been capitalized to the community are recoverable or should be written off 
the write off is charged to cost of revenues in the period in which the need for the write off is determined 
the estimates used in the determination of the estimated cash flows and fair value of both current and future communities are based on factors known to us at the time such estimates are made and our expectations of future operations and economic conditions 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated fair value deteriorate in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges and write offs related to current and future communities 
we provided for inventory impairment charges and the expensing of costs that we believed not to be recoverable in each of the three fiscal years ended october   and as shown in the table below amounts in thousands 
land controlled for future communities land owned for future communities operating communities the table below provides  for the periods indicated  the number of operating communities that we reviewed for potential impairment  the number of operating communities in which we recognized impairment charges  the amount of impairment charges recognized  and  as of the end of the period indicated  the fair value of those communities  net of impairment charges amounts in thousands 
impaired operating communities three months ended number of communities tested number of communities fair value of communities  net of impairment charges impairment charges fiscal january april july october fiscal january april july october fiscal january april july october income taxes valuation allowance significant judgment is applied in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
in accordance with gaap  a valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
we assess the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets based on gaap more likely than not realization threshold criteria 
in our assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is significant negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  consistency and magnitude of current and cumulative income and losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards being used before expiration  and tax planning alternatives 
our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets includes assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect our actual tax results and our future business results may affect the amount of our deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of our deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods carryforward period assumptions  actual results could differ from the estimates used in our analysis 
our assumptions require significant judgment because the residential home building industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
if our results of operations are less than projected and there is insufficient objectively verifiable positive evidence to support the more likely than not realization of our deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be required to reduce or eliminate our deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets consist principally of the recognition of losses primarily driven by inventory impairments and impairments of investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities 
in accordance with gaap  we assessed whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
in fiscal  we recorded valuation allowances against substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
we believed that the continued downturn in the housing market  the uncertainty as to its length and magnitude  our continued recognition of impairment charges  and our recent operating losses were significant negative evidence of the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
at october   we expect to utilize all prior year federal tax loss carryforwards resulting from losses incurred for federal income tax purposes during fiscal years and on our fiscal federal income tax return 
we file tax returns in the various states in which we do business 
each state has its own statutes regarding the use of tax loss carryforwards 
some of the states in which we do business do not allow for the carry forward of losses while others allow for carry forwards for years to years 
at october   we re evaluated the evidence related to the need for our deferred tax asset valuation allowances and determined that the valuation allowances on our federal deferred tax assets and certain state deferred tax assets were no longer needed because of sufficient positive objective evidence 
that evidence principally consisted of i an indication that the events and conditions that gave rise to significant reported losses in recent years were unlikely to recur in the foreseeable future  ii a return to profitability in  iii strong backlog evidencing that profitability would likely increase in  and iv long net operating loss carryfoward periods that provided evidence that even without significant growth these deferred tax assets would more likely than not be realized 
some of the evidence considered was as follows we incurred pre tax losses from through totaling billion 
these losses were driven primarily by impairments of land  options  inventory and joint ventures which aggregated approximately billion during that period 
the impairment charges were triggered by the most severe and longest downturn in the us housing industry 
we generated pre tax income of million in the six month period ended october  this included generating pre tax income in five out of the previous six consecutive quarters ended october  our operations had been profitable in each of the last ten quarters ended october   excluding impairment charges 
impairment charges in fiscal decreased to million due to the strength of the recovery in the housing industry and the lower carrying value of our inventories and joint venture investments as a result of the significant writedowns recognized on them over the period from through the value of new contracts signed in fiscal increased over fiscal our cancellation rate of in units and in value in fiscal was the lowest it has been since before we expected significant revenue and pre tax income growth in fiscal which was supported by our backlog as well as the continued improvement in housing industry trends 
our backlog at october   which totaled billion  was the highest it had been since our backlog is a strong indicator of our next eight months of operations as we require a signed agreement of sale and a significant cash deposit for a sale to be included in backlog 
we had objective and verifiable positive evidence  summarized more fully below  that we would continue to be profitable in fiscal due to our backlog 
that positive evidence in tandem with other positive evidence provided the basis for overcoming the negative evidence 
even without growth in our profits over levels of profitability  we would realize our federal deferred tax assets in less than years 
based on our belief that the recovery in the housing market would be sustained  we expected to continue to grow revenues and be profitable beyond fiscal housing market indices showed positive gains in fiscal unemployment rates continued to decrease from october  consumer confidence showed continued improvement  and housing affordability was at near record levels 
the october seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts was  as compared to  in october which represented an increase of 
the improvement in the housing market had been experienced by all the major public home builders 
the financial community and economists were optimistic regarding the housing trends going into there was significant pent up demand for housing that we believed would support a prolonged recovery 
according to the us census bureau  during the period through  total housing starts in the united states averaged approximately million per year  while in the period through  total housing starts averaged approximately million per year 
in addition  based on the trend of household formations in relation to population growth during the period through  the number of household formations in the four year period of through was approximately million less than would have been expected 
we believed that the demographics of the move up  empty nester  active adult  age qualified and second home upscale markets would provide us with the potential for growth in the coming decade 
according to the us census bureau  the number of households earning  or more in constant dollars at september stood at million  or approximately of all us households 
this group grew at three times the rate of increase of all us households since according to harvard university june the state of the nation housing  the growth and aging of the current population and assuming the economic recovery is sustained over the next few years supports the addition of about one million new household formations per year during the next decade 
we emerged from the downturn with reduced competition and increased market share 
we believed that many home builders in the areas in which we operated were no longer in business and that access to capital by the remaining ones was severely constrained 
the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts in october increased over the october rate  whereas the increase in the number of our signed contracts in fiscal was 
the excess of our contracts signed versus the housing starts evidenced the additional market share we gained over the past year 
based on the above re evaluation  we reversed million of federal and state deferred tax asset valuation allowances in fiscal in fiscal  we continued to re evaluate our need for a state deferred tax asset valuation allowance and updated our fiscal analysis 
based upon our better than forecasted operating results in fiscal  our significantly higher backlog at october  and improved forecast of results of operations in fiscal  we reversed an additional million of state deferred tax asset valuation allowances in fiscal revenue and cost recognition the construction time of our homes is generally less than one year  although some homes may take more than one year to complete 
revenues and cost of revenues from these home sales are recorded at the time each home is delivered and title and possession are transferred to the buyer 
for detached homes  closing normally occurs shortly after construction is substantially completed 
for our standard attached and detached homes  land  land development and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are amortized to the cost of homes closed based upon the total number of homes to be constructed in each community 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs subsequent to the commencement of delivery of homes are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
for our master planned communities  the estimated land  common area development and related costs  including the cost of golf courses  net of their estimated residual value  are allocated to individual communities within a master planned community on a relative sales value basis 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated number of homes to be constructed or in the estimated costs are allocated to the remaining home sites in each of the communities of the master planned community 
for high rise mid rise projects  land  land development  construction and related costs  both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future  are generally amortized to the cost of units closed based upon an estimated relative sales value of the units closed to the total estimated sales value 
any changes resulting from a change in the estimated total costs or revenues of the project are allocated to the remaining units to be delivered 
forfeited customer deposits are recognized in other income net in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which we determine that the customer will not complete the purchase of the home and we have the right to retain the deposit 
sales incentives in order to promote sales of our homes  we grant our home buyers sales incentives from time to time 
these incentives will vary by type of incentive and by amount on a community by community and home by home basis 
incentives that impact the value of the home or the sales price paid  such as special or additional options  are generally reflected as a reduction in sales revenues 
incentives that we pay to an outside party  such as paying some or all of a home buyer s closing costs  are recorded as an additional cost of revenues 
incentives are recognized at the time the home is delivered to the home buyer and we receive the sales proceeds 
off balance sheet arrangements we have investments in and advances to various unconsolidated entities 
our investments in these entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
at october   we had investments in and advances to these entities of million  and were committed to invest or advance million to these entities if they require additional funding 
the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments generally finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing 
in some instances  we and our partners have guaranteed debt of certain unconsolidated entities which may include any  or all  of the following i project completion including any cost overruns  in whole or in part  ii repayment guarantees  generally covering a percentage of the outstanding loan  iii indemnification of the lender from environmental matters of the unconsolidated entity and iv indemnification of the lender from bad boy acts of the unconsolidated entity or its partners 
in some instances  the guarantees provided in connection with loans to an unconsolidated entity are joint and several 
in these situations  we generally have a reimbursement agreement with our partner that provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share of the guarantee 
however  if the joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement  we may be liable for more than our proportionate share 
we believe that as of october   in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of an unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event  the collateral should be sufficient to repay a significant portion of the obligation 
if it is not  we and our partners would need to contribute additional capital to the venture 
at october   the unconsolidated entities that have guarantees related to debt had loan commitments aggregating million and had borrowed an aggregate of million 
we estimate that our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees  if the full amount of the loan commitments were borrowed  would be million before any reimbursement from the our partners 
based on the amounts borrowed at october   our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees is estimated to be million before any reimbursement from our partners 
in addition  we have guaranteed approximately million of ground lease payments and insurance deductibles for three joint ventures

the trends  uncertainties or other factors that have negatively impacted our business and the industry in general have also impacted the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
we review each of our investments on a quarterly basis for indicators of impairment 
a series of operating losses of an investee  the inability to recover our invested capital  or other factors may indicate that a loss in value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred 
if a loss exists  we further review to determine if the loss is other than temporary  in which case  we write down the investment to its fair value 
the evaluation of our investment in an unconsolidated entity entails a detailed cash flow analysis using many estimates including but not limited to expected sales pace  expected sales prices  expected incentives  costs incurred and anticipated  sufficiency of financing and capital  competition  market conditions and anticipated cash receipts  in order to determine projected future distributions 
each of the unconsolidated entities evaluates its inventory in a similar manner as we do 
see inventory above for more detailed disclosure on our evaluation of inventory 
if a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets  our proportionate share is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding decrease to our investment in unconsolidated entities

the impairment was attributable to our investment in south edge llc  and its successor entity  inspirada builders  llc collectively  inspirada 
inspirada settled litigation regarding a loan made by a syndicate of lenders to it having a principal balance of million  for which we had executed certain completion guarantees and conditional repayment guarantees 
we paid million in november to settle this matter 
the disposition of the above matter did not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity or on our financial condition 
in fiscal  due to the deterioration of the market in which one of our home building joint ventures operated  we determined that there was an other than temporary impairment of our investment in this joint venture  based on this determination  we recognized million in impairment charges against the carrying value of our investment in this joint venture

in fiscal  we delivered  homes with a value of billion  as compared to  homes in fiscal with a value of billion 
the increase in the number of homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the higher number of homes in backlog at the beginning of fiscal  as compared to the beginning of fiscal  and the increase in the number of net contracts signed in the first six months of fiscal  as compared to the comparable period of fiscal the increase in the average price of homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to a shift in the number of homes delivered to more expensive areas and or products and increases in selling prices in fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal we recognized inventory impairment charges and write offs of million in fiscal and million in fiscal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  excluding impairments  was of revenues in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  excluding inventory impairment charges  as a percentage of revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to lower materials  labor  interest and closing costs  improved absorption of job overhead due to the increased number of homes closed in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the reduced impact on costs in fiscal  as compared to fiscal from the application of purchase accounting on the homes delivered from the acquisition of camwest development llc camwest in november  offset  in part  by the increased cost of land and land improvements in fiscal  as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a increased by million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the decline in sg a as a percentage of revenues was due to sg a increasing by while revenues increased

the trends  uncertainties or other factors that have negatively impacted our business and the industry in general  and which are discussed in the overview section of this md a  have also impacted the unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
most of our unconsolidated entities are land development projects or high rise mid rise construction projects and do not generate revenues and earnings for a number of years during the development of the property 
once development is complete  these unconsolidated entities will generally  over a relatively short period of time  generate revenues and earnings until all of the assets of the entity are sold 
because there is not a steady flow of revenues and earnings from these entities  the earnings recognized from these entities will vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in fiscal  we recognized million of income from unconsolidated entities  as compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a million recovery of costs previously incurred related to a joint venture 
the million decrease in income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  excluding the recovery recognized in fiscal  was due principally to lower income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  generated from two condominium joint ventures due to their substantial completion in fiscal  offset  in part  by higher income realized from gibraltar structured asset joint venture  a distribution received in fiscal from the trust in excess of our cost basis  and a land development joint venture that sold a large parcel of land to an outside developer in fiscal  as compared to fiscal other income net other income net includes the gains and losses from our ancillary businesses  income from gibraltar  interest income  management fee income  retained customer deposits  income losses on land sales and other miscellaneous items

the reversal of previously accrued taxes and related interest on uncertain tax positions is due primarily to the expiration of the statute of limitations on these items

selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a increased by million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenues  sg a was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a was due primarily to increased compensation costs and increased sales and marketing costs 
the increased compensation costs and increased sales and marketing costs were due primarily to the increased number of communities we had open in fiscal  the increase in net sales contracts taken and the number of homes delivered in fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decline in sg a  as a percentage of revenues  was due to sg a increasing by while revenues increased 
the decline in the sg a percentage was due in part to only a portion of these expenses varying directly with the amount of revenues recognized while an additional portion of these expenses were semi fixed

no impairment charges were recognized in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a million recovery of costs we previously incurred 
the million decrease in income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  excluding the impairment charges recognized in fiscal and the recovery recognized in fiscal  was due principally to lower income generated from two of our condominium joint ventures  primarily due to the delivery of fewer units in fiscal than in fiscal  a distribution received in fiscal from the trust in excess of our cost basis in it  and lower income realized from our structured asset joint venture in fiscal  as compared to fiscal due primarily to the favorable settlement in fiscal of a large distress loan

capital resources and liquidity funding for our business has been  and continues to be  provided principally by cash flow from operating activities before inventory additions  unsecured bank borrowings and the public debt and equity markets 
at october   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and approximately million available under our billion revolving credit facility which extends to august cash used in operating activities during fiscal was million primarily for the acquisition of inventory  the origination of mortgage loans  net of sales to outside investors  and the purchase of commercial property for development  offset in part  from pre tax income from operations  an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses  an increase in customer deposits and a decrease in restricted cash 
in fiscal  cash provided by our investing activities was million  including million of sales and redemptions of marketable securities  and million of cash received as returns on our investments in unconsolidated entities  distressed loans and foreclosed real estate 
the cash provided by investing activities was offset  in part  by million of purchases of marketable securities  million of investments in joint venture projects  million of investments in distressed loans and foreclosed real estate and million in purchases of property and equipment 
we generated million of cash from financing activities in fiscal  primarily from the issuance of million of senior notes due  million from the proceeds of our stock based benefit plans and a tax benefit of million from our stock based compensation plans 
the cash provided by financing activities was offset  in part  by the repayment at maturity of million of our senior notes in november  the repayment at maturity of million of our senior notes in september  million of loans payable repayments  net of new borrowings and million for the repurchase of our common stock 
at october   we had billion of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and approximately million available under our million revolving credit facility which extended to october cash used in operating activities during fiscal was million primarily from the acquisition of inventory  the origination of mortgage loans  net of sales to outside investors  and the reduction of our accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset in part from pre tax income from operations 
in fiscal  cash used in our investing activities was million  including million of purchases of marketable securities  million for the acquisition of the assets of camwest  million to fund new joint venture projects  million for investments in a non performing loan portfolio and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
the cash used in investing activities was offset  in part  by million of sales and redemptions of marketable securities  million of cash received as returns on our investments in unconsolidated entities and in non performing loan portfolios and foreclosed real estate 
we generated million of cash from financing activities in fiscal  primarily from the issuance of million of senior notes due in february  the issuance of million of senior exchangeable notes due in september  million from the proceeds of our stock based benefit plans and million of net new borrowings under our mortgage company warehouse facility 
the cash provided by financing activities was offset  in part  by million of cash used to repay loans payable  net of new borrowings 
at october   we had billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand and approximately million available under our million revolving credit facility that extended to october in fiscal  cash flow provided by operating activities was million 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was primarily from our earnings before inventory and joint venture impairments  depreciation and amortization  the receipt of a million federal income tax refund and a decrease in restricted cash  offset  in part  by an increase in inventory 
we used million of cash in our investing activities in fiscal  primarily for investments made in non performing loan portfolios and marketable securities and the purchase of property  construction and office equipment  offset  in part  by the return of investments from unconsolidated entities and from our non performing loan portfolios 
we also used million of cash in financing activities in fiscal  principally for the million redemption of senior notes  the net repayment of million of loans payable and the purchase of million of treasury stock  offset  in part by proceeds received from our stock based benefit plans 
in general  our cash flow from operating activities assumes that  as each home is delivered  we will purchase a home site to replace it 
because we own several years supply of home sites  we do not need to buy home sites immediately to replace those that we deliver 
in addition  we generally do not begin construction of our detached homes until we have a signed contract with the home buyer  although in the past several years  due to the increase in the number of attached home communities from which we were operating all of the units of which are generally not sold prior to the commencement of construction  the number of speculative homes in our inventory increased significantly 
should our business remain at its current level or decline  we believe that our inventory levels would decrease as we complete and deliver the homes under construction but do not commence construction of as many new homes  as we complete the improvements on the land we already own and as we sell and deliver the speculative homes that are currently in inventory  resulting in additional cash flow from operations 
in addition  we might delay or curtail our acquisition of additional land  as we did during the period april through january  which would further reduce our inventory levels and cash needs 
at october   we owned or controlled through options  home sites  as compared to  at october    at october   and  at april   the high point of our home sites owned and controlled 
of the  home sites owned or controlled through options at october   we owned  of our owned home sites at october   significant improvements were completed on approximately  of them 
in november  we agreed to acquire all of the equity interests in shapell  consisting of shapell single family residential real property development business  including a portfolio of approximately  home sites in california 
see overview acquisition in this md a for more information about the shapell acquisition 
at october   the aggregate purchase price of land parcels under option and purchase agreements was approximately billion including million of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested 
of the billion of land purchase commitments  we had paid or deposited million and  if we acquire all of these land parcels  we will be required to pay an additional billion 
the purchases of these land parcels are scheduled over the next several years 
we have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from the aforementioned aggregate purchase amounts since we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us to terminate these contracts 
at october   we also had a purchase commitment to acquire a parcel of land for approximately million which we intend to develop with a joint venture partner  we expect to acquire up to  home sites from the joint venture and the joint venture expects to sell the remaining home sites to outside builders 
in december  the joint venture was formed and the joint venture acquired the land 
during the past several years  we have had a significant amount of cash invested in either short term cash equivalents or short term interest bearing marketable securities 
in addition  we have made a number of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the acquisition and development of land for future home sites or in entities that are constructing or converting apartment buildings into luxury condominiums 
our investment activities related to marketable securities and to investments in and distributions of investments from unconsolidated entities are contained in the consolidated statements of cash flows under cash flow provided by used in investing activities 
in august  we entered into an billion revolving credit facility with banks  which extends to august at october   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility but had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
at october   interest would have been payable on borrowings under our credit facility at subject to adjustment based upon our debt rating and leverage ratios above the eurodollar rate or at other specified variable rates as selected by us from time to time 
we are obligated to pay an undrawn commitment fee of subject to adjustment based upon our debt rating and leverage ratios based on the average daily unused amount of the credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are not permitted to allow our maximum leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement to exceed to  and we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the credit agreement of approximately billion at october  at october   our leverage ratio was approximately to  and our tangible net worth was approximately billion 
at october   based upon the minimum tangible net worth requirement  our ability to pay dividends was limited to an aggregate amount of approximately billion or the repurchase of our common stock of approximately billion 
in addition  at october   we had million of letters of credit outstanding that were not part of our new credit facility  these letters of credit were collateralized by million of cash deposits 
we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our current operations and meet our contractual obligations through a combination of our existing cash resources and existing sources of credit 
due to the uncertainies in the economy and for home builders in general  we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace existing financing or find sources of additional financing in the future 
inflation the long term impact of inflation on us is manifested in increased costs for land  land development  construction and overhead 
we generally contract for land significantly before development and sales efforts begin 
accordingly  to the extent land acquisition costs are fixed  increases or decreases in the sales prices of homes will affect our profits 
prior to the recent sustained downturn in the economy and the decline in demand for homes  the sales prices of our homes generally increased over time 
because the sales price of each of our homes is fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to purchase a home and because we generally contract to sell our homes before we begin construction  any inflation of costs in excess of those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
we generally attempt to minimize that effect by entering into fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for specified periods of time  which generally do not exceed one year 
the downturn in the housing market and related slowdown in the home building industry and the decline in the sales prices of our homes in that period  without a corresponding reduction in the costs  had an adverse impact on our profitability 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs 
interest rates  the length of time that land remains in inventory and the proportion of inventory that is financed affect our interest costs 
if we are unable to raise sales prices enough to compensate for higher costs  or if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  affecting prospective buyers ability to adequately finance home purchases  our revenues  gross margins and net income would be adversely affected 
increases in sales prices  whether the result of inflation or demand  may affect the ability of prospective buyers to afford new homes 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated contractual payment obligations at october  amounts in millions thereafter total senior notes a loans payable a mortgage company warehouse loan a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b retirement plans c other a amounts include estimated annual interest payments until maturity of the debt

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our earnings and cash flow 
we do not have the obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on such debt until we are required to refinance such debt 
at october   our debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value were as follows amounts in thousands fixed rate debt variable rate debt a fiscal year of maturity amount weighted average interest rate amount weighted average interest rate thereafter discount total fair value at october  a based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at october   and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each increase in interest rates would increase the interest incurred by us by approximately million per year
