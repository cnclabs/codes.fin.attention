overview on november   nabi pharmaceuticals  inc nabi and biota holdings limited  a biopharmaceutical company based in melbourne  australia that had been listed on the australian stock exchange since  completed a merger  and renamed the resulting company biota pharmaceuticals  inc biota  the company  us or we 
former biota holdings limited shareholders retained approximately of our shares of common stock  while former nabi shareholders retained approximately as consideration for nabi s net assets  which consisted primarily of million in net cash on hand on the date of the merger 
upon completion of the merger  each outstanding share of biota holdings limited converted into shares of nabi common stock as determined by the exchange ratio  including the impact of a reverse stock split of nabi s common stock at a ratio of as nabi had minimal ongoing activity with respect to its development programs or related operations at the time of the merger  our historical and current operations primarily reflect the operations of biota holdings limited 
due to the fact that former biota holdings limited shareholders held a significant majority of the voting interest in us upon the completion of the merger  the merger was accounted for as a reverse merger  such that  notwithstanding the fact that nabi was the legal acquirer  biota holdings limited was considered the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  the financial statements of biota holdings limited are treated as our historical financial statements  with the operating results of nabi being included therein beginning november  as a result of the reverse merger  the company adopted a june fiscal year end 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative anti infective products to prevent and treat serious and potentially life threatening infectious diseases 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware since and our corporate headquarters are located in alpharetta  georgia 
we are currently focused on developing oral  small molecule compounds to treat a number of viral and bacterial infections 
our most advanced clinical stage program is laninamivir octanoate  a long acting neuraminidase inhibitor we are developing for the treatment of influenza a and b that is currently enrolling patients in a multi national phase trial  which we refer to as igloo 
in addition to laninamivir octanoate  we are developing an orally bioavailable therapeutic for the treatment of rsv infections in children  the elderly  and immune compromised patients 
we also have a phase compound  vapendavir bta  which has been in clinical development for the treatment of human rhinovirus hrv infections in patients with mild to moderate asthma 
finally  we have a discovery stage program focused on novel antibiotics designed to treat gram positive and gram negative bacterial infections 
we previously developed zanamivir  a neuraminidase inhibitor ni  which is marketed worldwide by gsk as relenza for the prevention and treatment of influenza a and b 
gsk developed and markets relenza pursuant to a royalty bearing research and license agreement we entered into with it in in  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with daiichi sankyo  under which each party cross licensed their intellectual property related to second generation long acting neuraminidase inhibitors lani  including flunet and laninamivir octanoate 
in  we entered into a separate commercialization agreement with daiichi sankyo  which provided it an exclusive license to laninamivir octanoate in japan and entitled us to a royalty on net sales of laninamivir octanoate in japan 
in september  laninamivir octanoate was approved for sale by the japanese ministry of health and welfare for the treatment of influenza a and b in adults and children 
laninamivir octanoate is marketed in japan by daiichi sankyo as inavir 
in  we filed an investigational new drug application ind with the fda to develop laninamivir octanoate in the u 
s  and in we were awarded a contract from the us office of biomedical advanced research and development authority barda designed to provide up to million in support of the development of and submission for a new drug application nda of laninamivir octanoate for the treatment of influenza a and b infections in the united states 
in june  we initiated a phase clinical trial of laninamivir octanoate under this ind 
although several of our influenza product candidates have been successfully developed and commercialized by other larger pharmaceutical companies under collaboration  license or commercialization agreements with us  we have not independently developed or received regulatory approval for any product candidate  and we do not currently have any sales  marketing or commercial capabilities 
therefore  it is possible that we may not successfully derive any significant product revenues from any of our existing or future development stage influenza or other product candidates that we are developing now  or may develop in the future 
background we have historically focused our research and drug development capabilities on discovering and developing small molecule compounds that can prevent or treat infectious diseases 
infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that are present in the environment  such as viruses and bacteria  which enter the body through various means and overwhelm its natural defenses and cause an infection 
the severity of an infectious disease varies depending on the nature of the infectious pathogen  as well as the degree to which the body s immune system or available therapies can prevent or fight the infection 
the market for anti infective drugs generally can be divided into three general categories antiviral  antibacterial and antifungal 
the use of anti infective drugs has led to a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases 
however  for many infectious diseases  current treatment options are associated with suboptimal treatment outcomes  significant adverse or toxic side effects  the emergence of drug resistant pathogens  complex dosing schedules  and inconvenient methods of administration 
these factors often lead to patients prematurely discontinuing treatment or not fully complying with treatment dosing schedules  resulting in a treatment failure 
moreover  a patient s failure to comply fully with a recommended dosing schedule can both accelerate and exacerbate the emergence of drug resistant strains 
the ability of both viruses and bacteria to adapt rapidly to existing or new treatments through genetic mutations allows new strains to develop that may be resistant to currently available drugs 
in recent years  the increasing prevalence of drug resistant pathogens has created ongoing treatment challenges with respect to many infectious diseases 
viruses viruses are microscopic infectious agents consisting of an outer layer of protein surrounding a core of genetic material comprised of deoxyribonucleic acid dna or ribonucleic acid rna 
viruses generally must invade healthy  living host cells in order to replicate and spread 
in many cases  the body s immune system can effectively combat an infection caused by a virus 
however  with certain viral infections  the body s immune system is unable to fully destroy or inhibit the replication of the respective virus  which results in persistent and ongoing viral replication and the subsequent infection of healthy cells by the virus 
this ultimately leads to the deterioration or destruction of the infected cells  resulting in disease 
viruses that develop resistance to antiviral drugs increasingly represent a major challenge public health challenge 
the existence of drug resistant strains  as well as the ability of viruses to mutate spontaneously during replication  allow drug resistant strains to emerge when patients do not comply with a dosing regimen  or use drugs that are not potent enough to quickly and completely inhibit viral replication 
drug resistance occurs because viruses continually replicate and can make millions of copies of themselves every day  some of which will contain mutations in their genetic material 
mutations that emerge in the presence of a suppressive antiviral drug will give rise to mutant strains that are wholly or partially resistant to that drug 
these mutant viruses  while initially low in number  eventually become the predominant strain in an infected patient as those strains that remain susceptible to the drug are inhibited from replicating 
once this occurs  the treatment benefit of that particular antiviral drug often diminishes  resulting in treatment failure and the need for an alternate therapy with different or possibly new drugs  or classes of drugs 
bacteria unlike viruses  bacteria do not generally invade a living host cell in order to grow and replicate 
bacteria are unicellular  self propagating microorganisms that multiply through growth in bacterial cell size and the subsequent division of the cell 
bacteria can be broadly classified into two categories based upon the composition of their cell walls gram positive or gram negative 
many antibacterial drugs that are effective against gram positive bacteria are less effective or totally ineffective against gram negative bacteria  and vice versa 
antibacterial drugs that are active against a large number of both classes of bacteria are often referred to as broad spectrum antibiotics 
antibiotics  which are small molecule chemical compounds  comprise the vast majority of currently marketed antibacterial drugs 
antibiotics have historically proved to be highly successful in controlling the morbidity and mortality that accompany many bacterial infections 
however  the widespread use  and in some cases the overuse of antibiotics has led to the emergence of bacteria resistant strains  which limit the effectiveness of existing drugs 
this led the world health organization who to state in that antibiotic resistance is one of the three greatest threats to human health 
the centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimates that more than of us hospital based infections are resistant to at least one of the antibiotics most commonly used to treat them 
antibiotic resistance is primarily caused by genetic mutations in bacteria selected by exposure to antibiotics where the drug does not kill all of the bacteria 
in addition to mutated bacteria being resistant to the drug used for treatment  many bacterial strains can also be cross resistant  meaning that the use of a particular treatment to address one kind of bacteria can result in resistance to other kinds of bacteria as well as to other antibiotics 
as a result  the effectiveness of many antibiotics has declined  limiting physicians options to treat serious infections 
antibiotic resistance has a significant impact on mortality and contributes heavily to health care system costs worldwide 
our pipeline the following chart summarizes key information regarding our anti infective product candidates 
bota kimgjpg 
in addition to the product candidates listed in the table above  we conduct research with other compounds that may address different therapeutic areas  or have other mechanisms of action 
we continue to identify  evaluate and test early stage compounds to determine if any should be advanced further into development 
influenza seasonal influenza  or the flu  is an acute viral infection caused by an influenza virus 
there are three types of seasonal influenza a  b and c 
type a influenza viruses are further typed into subtypes according to different kinds and combinations of virus surface proteins 
among many subtypes of influenza a viruses  currently influenza a hn pmd and influenza a hn subtypes are circulating among humans 
influenza viruses circulate in every part of the world 
type c influenza cases occur much less frequently than a and b 
seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever  cough usually dry  headache  muscle and joint pain  severe malaise feeling unwell  sore throat and runny nose 
most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention 
however  influenza can cause severe illness or death in people at high risk  which include the very young  elderly or chronically ill 
the time from infection to illness  known as the incubation period  is generally about two days 
influenza epidemics generally occur annually during the autumn and winter in temperate regions 
illness can result in hospitalization and death  mainly among high risk groups 
according to the who  these annual epidemics result in about three to five million cases of severe illness  and about  to  deaths worldwide 
most deaths associated with influenza in industrialized countries occur among people age or older 
controlling influenza virus infections continues to be a major public health challenge 
despite increasingly widespread vaccination  influenza remains a significant burden that can give rise to a potential crisis  even in communities with advanced health care 
in  the cdc estimated that in the us from  influenza caused an average of  deaths per year 
immunization is the primary form of preventing influenza infection 
however  the efficacy of influenza vaccination varies  decreasing with age  and in the prevention of seasonal influenza  is dependent on how well matched the chosen vaccine is to the emergent circulating virus 
in pandemic influenza outbreaks  vaccines can only be developed following identification of the pandemic strain  which results in vaccines not being available immediately 
these limitations of vaccination emphasize the importance of and need for antiviral drugs to treat and prevent influenza 
market opportunity for the treatment of influenza viral respiratory tract infections are among the most common reasons for visits to the emergency department and the hospitalization of children in the us data from the cdc suggest that each year of the population million according to us population estimates suffers from seasonal influenza  and approximately  people in the us are hospitalized each year for respiratory and heart conditions associated with seasonal influenza infections 
the market opportunity for antivirals to prevent or treat influenza  and their utilization in the seasonal influenza market  is often difficult to project given the year to year variability in the circulating strain of influenza  the severity of influenza illness  and the length of the influenza season 
further  if there is a year in which a pandemic occurs  the variability in the market potential is magnified 
however  over a five year period  the seasonal influenza market opportunity can be more accurately assessed 
ims retail prescription data covering the influenza seasons indicated that average annual combined sales of oseltamivir phosphate tamiflu and zanamivir relenza in the us  japan  and the eu  were approximately m  m  and m  respectively  which reflects total annual sales in the three markets of approximately million 
in addition to seasonal influenza  government stockpiling of antivirals to prevent or treat influenza have historically contributed significantly to the overall market opportunity 
influenza antiviral drugs vaccines play an important role in the prevention of influenza 
nevertheless  the benefit of this intervention can be significantly reduced in the event there is a mismatch between the seasonal influenza vaccine and the circulating influenza virus  and the inability of an individual to mount a proper immune response 
therefore  antivirals also play an important role in the prevention and management of influenza 
there are two classes of antiviral agents used for influenza adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors  or ni s 
adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine are generally not recommended as stand alone treatment for influenza due to their lack of activity against influenza b  as well as a high level of influenza a resistance 
ni s are generally effective against all human  avian and animal influenza viruses 
nis inhibits the release of virions by competitively inhibiting viral neuraminidase  which is a key glycoprotein at the surface of the virus 
currently there are two nis that have been approved worldwide oseltamivir phosphate tamiflu and zanamivir relenza 
both drugs are approved for the treatment of acute  uncomplicated illness due to influenza a and b  and are also approved for preventive use 
further  laninamivir octanoate inavir is approved in japan  and intravenously administered peramivir is approved in japan rapiacta and korea peramiflu for the treatment of influenza 
limitations of current therapies for the treatment of influenza an increase in the frequency of oseltamivir resistant influenza viruses is a growing problem 
when oseltamivir was first introduced  the proportion of oseltamivir resistant viruses among circulating viruses was low  generally less than 
however  during the northern hemisphere influenza season there was a significant increase in the frequency of seasonal hn influenza viruses carrying the highly oseltamivir resistant hy mutation 
this spontaneously occurring oseltamivir resistant mutant became prevalent worldwide in the influenza season  and continues to circulate today 
furthermore  although pandemic hn has remained largely susceptible to oseltamivir phosphate  sporadic cases of resistance have been reported 
to the contrary  to date there has been no clinically significant reports of zanamivir or laninamivir octanoate resistance  in circulating influenza a hn viruses  or any other human influenza viruses 
the increasing levels of oseltamivir resistance  together with the recent spread of pandemic hn swine origin  highlight the need for the development of new options for the treatment of influenza 
the frequency of dosing of  and therefore patient compliance with  the currently approved drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza is another potential limitation that can be improved upon 
for adults  the dosing regimen for oseltamivir phosphate and zanamivir is twice a day for five consecutive days 
in contrast  laninamivir octanoate inavir is a one time inhaled treatment 
we believe this more convenient dosing regimen will result in better patient compliance as compared to both oseltamivir phosphate and zanamivir 
laninamivir octanoate in collaboration with daiichi sankyo  we have identified a new class of inhaled long acting neuraminidase inhibitors lani 
laninamivir octanoate  also known as cs  is a second generation octanoyl ester prodrug of laninamivir 
laninamivir has been shown to have in vitro neuraminidase inhibitory activity against various influenza a and b viruses  including subtypes n to n and oseltamivir resistant viruses  and it has also been found to be effective against a swine origin hn strain 
moreover  laninamivir octanoate has long lasting antiviral activity 
preclinical studies in mice have demonstrated that after intranasal administration  it was rapidly converted to its active metabolite  laninamivir  which was retained in the lungs where it had a long half life of approximately hours 
further  a single intranasal dose of laninamivir octanoate exhibited efficacy similar to that of repeated doses of zanamivir or oseltamivir phosphate 
in  we cross licensed intellectual property related to lani with daiichi sankyo  of which the lead product  laninamivir octanoate  was successfully developed and  since  is being marketed by daiichi sankyo as inavir in japan for the treatment of influenza a and b infections 
in november  daiichi sankyo submitted a japanese new drug application jnda to the japanese ministry of health and welfare for approval of inavir for use in post exposure prophylaxis 
we are currently developing laninamivir octanoate under an ind in the us for the treatment of influenza a and b 
laninamivir octanoate clinical trials phase in june  we commenced enrollment in a multi national  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  parallel arm phase clinical trial of laninamivir octanoate 
the trial  which we refer to as igloo  will compare the safety and efficacy of mg and mg of laninamivir octanoate with placebo  all delivered by a twincaps inhaler in adults with symptomatic influenza a or b infection 
the trial is designed to enroll subjects  randomized equally across the three treatment arms  with the primary end point being the time to alleviation of influenza symptoms cough  sore throat  nasal congestion  headache  body aches and pains  feeling feverish  and fatigue and fever for hours 
secondary end points include evaluating whether the use of laninamivir octanoate reduces the incidence of secondary bacterial infections compared to placebo  quantitative changes in virus shedding  the development of resistance by phenotypic and genotypic analyses  and the impact of treatment with laninamivir octanoate on the quality of life 
our goal is to complete enrollment in this trial by the end of the upcoming influenza season in the northern hemisphere and have top line data available in mid phase we have completed three phase trials of inhaled laninamivir octanoate 
these trials provide safety and pharmacokinetic data at single doses of laninamivir octanoate ranging from to mg in healthy volunteers aged to years of age  and at multiple doses up to mg twice daily for days or twice weekly for weeks in healthy volunteers aged to years of age 
a total of subjects were enrolled in these studies  with of those receiving laninamivir octanoate 
in healthy adult volunteers  laninamivir octanoate was generally well tolerated at single doses up to mg and at multiple doses up to mg administered twice daily for three days or twice weekly for six weeks 
daiichi sankyo clinical trials 
daiichi sankyo conducted a number of clinical trials that supported the approval of laninamivir octanoate inavir in japan 
these clinical trials include seven phase studies  four phase studies and eight phase studies of inhaled laninamivir octanoate at single doses up to mg  and multiple doses up to mg 
the results of a number of these clinical studies have been published 
data pooled from a total of clinical trials indicate that the most common adverse events were diarrhea of subjects  nausea of subjects and nasopharyngitis of subjects 
the majority of aes across the clinical studies were mild in intensity 
as of september  we estimate that approximately million patients had been exposed to laninamivir octanoate in post market use in japan 
commonly reported adverse drug reactions adrs in the post marketing period are abnormal behavior  diarrhea nausea and dizziness  with most adrs occurring within three days of dosing 
barda contract for laninamivir octanoate in  our wholly owned subsidiary  biota scientific management pty ltd  was awarded a contract from barda for the late stage development of laninamivir octanoate on a cost plus fixed fee basis  the total of which is not to exceed million 
barda is part of the us office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response aspr within the us department of health and human services hhs 
the barda contract is designed to fund and provide us with all technical and clinical data and us based manufacturing to support the filing of a nda with the fda for laninamivir octanoate 
the performance period of the barda contract commenced on march   and continues for five years 
to date  we have recognized revenue totaling million pursuant to this contract 
human rhinovirus hrv hrv belongs to a diverse family of plus strand rna viruses referred to as picornaviridiae 
this family also includes the human enteroviruses and hepatoviruses human hepatitis a  as well as certain animal viruses 
while more than different viruses are known to cause symptoms of the common cold  it is estimated that hrv causes of all cases 
however  hrv infection is also associated with more serious conditions  including acute otitis media  sinusitis and lower respiratory tract diseases such as pneumonia  bronchitis and bronchiolitis and exacerbation of chronic respiratory illnesses 
individuals with chronic lung diseases  such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  are especially vulnerable to hrv infections  which may cause acute exacerbations of asthma  emphysema or chronic bronchitis in these more susceptible individuals 
hrv is believed to be the primary cause of asthma exacerbations 
epidemiological studies have demonstrated that a significant number of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis cf are preceded by hrv infections 
each episode of infection appears to cause the progression of the underlying disease and  each exacerbation may shorten the life of the patient 
accordingly  hrv infection in this population is potentially life threatening 
there remains a significant unmet medical need to identify treatments which can shorten the duration of hrv induced illness  lessen the severity of symptoms  minimize secondary infections and exacerbations of underlying respiratory disease and  reduce virus transmission 
there are also potentially important health economic and quality of life benefits arising from reducing the number of upper respiratory tract infections 
vapendavir bta rhinoviruses access respiratory tract cells by attaching to a receptor on the cell surface 
canyon like clefts on the surface  or capsid  of the virus attach to the receptor which precedes virus infection of the cell 
we have developed the antiviral compound vapendavir bta which is designed to bind to a highly conserved pocket in the floor of the canyon 
vapendavir  a capsid binder  effectively stops infection by interfering with receptor binding and or related early steps in the infectious cycle 
vapendavir is a broad spectrum inhibitor of the large group of culturable hrvs with strong potency against a variety of diverse enteroviruses such as poliovirus 
vapendavir is dosed orally and is in development for the treatment of hrv infections in patients with asthma 
vapendavir clinical trials phase b 
in march  we completed a patient  phase b clinical trial of vapendavir that evaluated the safety and efficacy of mg of vapendavir  dosed twice daily for six days  for the treatment of hrv infections in patients with mild to moderate asthma 
the trial successfully met the primary endpoint  which was a reduction of cold symptoms based on the wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey wurss severity score 
vapendavir was generally tolerated and most treatment related adverse events were of mild intensity  with moderate treatment related events reported in of subjects 
phase a 
in  we completed a phase a placebo controlled  double blind  randomized  parallel group trial to determine the potential of mg  mg and mg of vapendavir  when dosed twice daily for days  to prevent experimental hrv infection challenge design in healthy volunteers 
subjects that received mg achieved a statistically significant reduction compared to placebo in mean viral load on days to inclusive 
vapendavir was generally well tolerated  and the overall incidence of adverse events was low  not dose dependent  and was similar incidence to placebo 
there was one serious adverse event of neutropenic sepsis in a subject in the mg arm of the trial 
phase in  we completed a phase  placebo controlled  single and multiple oral dose  safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers 
single oral doses of mg  mg  mg  mg  mg  mg or mg of vapendavir were evaluated 
vapendavir was generally well tolerated and there were no dose limiting toxicities or trends in adverse events or laboratory parameters observed  with the incidence and nature of adverse events similar between placebo recipients and all dosing groups of vapendavir 
in a multiple ascending dose trial evaluating and mg of vapendavir  administered either qd or bid for seven or eight consecutive days  vapendavir was well tolerated 
there were no serious or severe adverse events and there were no dose limiting toxicities  clinically relevant changes in vital signs  ecg or laboratory parameters observed 
respiratory syncytial virus rsv rsv  a member of the paramyxoviridae family of viruses  is a major cause of acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants  young children  and adults 
the virus is typically spread via respiratory secretions through close contact with contaminated surfaces and objects 
the peak incidence of infections occurs in the winter months  usually coinciding with the influenza epidemic 
datamonitor estimates that annually  approximately million people are infected with rsv in the seven major markets  including over million children under the age of four  million elderly  and million adults with underlying disease 
about  of these individuals become hospitalized for this infection 
rsv infections are particularly problematic in infants 
in a given year  around  infants are hospitalized with rsv infection in the us these infections are responsible for to of hospitalizations for pediatric bronchiolitis and of hospitalizations for pediatric pneumonia 
the overall magnitude of hospitalizations makes rsv a very costly disease  although mortality is low 
to date only three drugs have been approved to either prevent or treat rsv infections 
ribavirin is used to treat serious rsv infections in infants with severe bronchiolitis and in immunocompromised patients 
however  its use is limited due to highly variable efficacy and toxicity risks 
in fact  current american academy of pediatrics guidelines for the treatment of bronchiolitis in children does not recommend the routine use ribavirin due to lack of clinical evidence supporting its use 
antibody based products respigam no longer available and synagis palivizumab were designed  developed and approved to prevent  not treat  rsv infections  and are very expensive 
as such  their use is limited in many hospitals 
in  astra zeneca reported global sales of synagis of million  with us sales of million and european sales of million 
based upon an estimated pool of million pediatric rsv patients ages months  we estimate that synagis is used in approximately of the estimated pediatric rsv patients in the us these data suggest that there remains a significant unmet need for safe and effective rsv antiviral treatments in all rsv populations 
our preclinical rsv antiviral program is focused on orally bio available f fusion protein inhibitors 
the mechanism of action of these compounds is believed to be via inhibition of fusion of the viral envelope to the cell membrane of the host cell 
the antiviral activity of our compounds has been demonstrated in vitro 
potent antiviral activity has been demonstrated in vitro against rsv a  long and b washington strains and the potency is not materially reduced in presence of serum proteins 
the antiviral activity of our compounds in a cytopathic effect inhibition assay using the laboratory isolate rsv a has produced ec s that range from of nm with a corresponding cc of m 
several of our fusion inhibitors have been dosed orally in preclinical studies and have demonstrated a pharmacokinetic profile that suggests the potential for once daily dosing in humans 
gram negative and gram positive bacterial infections we believe there is a significant need for new antibiotics to treat serious gram negative and gram positive and bacterial infections  due primarily to the growing incidence of drug resistance to currently marketed antibiotics 
the cdc estimates that more than of us hospital infections are resistant to at least one of the antibiotics most commonly used to treat them 
antibiotic resistance has limited the effectiveness of many existing drugs  and the discovery of new antibiotics to address resistance has not kept pace with the increasing incidence of difficult to treat microorganisms 
according to the infectious diseases society of america  the estimated cost to the us healthcare system of antibiotic resistant infections is approximately billion annually  a substantial portion of which is due to increased length of stay 
despite the significant need for new antibiotics with the above attributes  linezolid and daptomycin are the only examples of novel antibiotics that have been developed in the last few decades 
further  many of the existing antibiotics used to treat serious infections are difficult or inconvenient to administer 
many antibiotics are given twice daily for seven to days or more and patients can be hospitalized for much or all of this period  or require in home iv therapy 
we believe that there is a need for new antibiotics that have improved potency and pharmacokinetics  effectiveness against resistant bacterial strains  improved side effect profiles and more flexible administration formulations 
we believe the bacterial type ii topoisomerases  such as dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv  are attractive targets for new antibacterial drug discovery 
our preclinical compounds are novel dual targeting inhibitors of the atpase activity of dna gyrase gyrb and topoisomerase iv pare that exhibit potent bactericidal activity against drug resistant bacterial pathogens and a low frequency of spontaneous resistance 
our dual targeted antibiotics are active against the most relevant gram positive bacteria  including staphylococcus aureus  enterococcus faecium  enterococcus faecalis  streptococcus pneumonia  and streptococcus pyogenes 
additionally  we have compounds in development that target medically important gram negative bacteria  such as pseudomonas aeruginosa  acinetobacter baumannii  klebsiella pneumonia  hemophilus influenza and escherichia coli 
we have tested our preclinical compounds in antibacterial assays against a variety of bacteria  including representative panels of current clinical isolates 
in general  our dual targeting gyrb pare antibiotics have similar potency versus both wild type and antibiotic resistant bacterial strains 
further  we have demonstrated that our compounds targeting gram positive bacteria have anti bacterial activity in multiple animal models of infection 
our strategy our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company that develops differentiated products that can prevent and treat serious infections 
in order to achieve this strategic goal  in the near term we intend to employ the following strategy focus our resources on the development of antiviral product candidates 
in the near term  we plan to focus our resources primarily on further developing laninamivir octanoate under our contract with barda and advancing our preclinical rsv program 
more specifically  we intend to complete our ongoing phase igloo clinical trial of laninamivir octanoate and  subject to the results of this trial  develop and complete plans with barda to support a phase clinical trial program  advance our chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc for laninamivir octanoate with respect to both the active pharmaceutical ingredient api and the twincaps powder inhaler necessary to make phase and commercial grade drug product  continue to support and maintain the contract we have with barda for the late stage development of laninamivir octanoate  and nominate a rsv fusion inhibitor for advancement into ind enabling glp preclinical studies in seek strategic collaborations to accelerate the development of certain of our product candidates to optimize economic returns while managing risk 
we intend to pursue collaboration  co development or license agreements  or enter into other transactions in the future with third party pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies with greater clinical development  manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  which we believe can accelerate the development and or commercialization of vapendavir  our preclinical stage gyrb pare antibiotic compounds  and our preclinical hepatitis c polymerase inhibitors 
evaluate and consider in licensing  acquisition  co development  and other similar collaborative clinical stage development opportunities to better balance our pipeline 
we intend to identify  evaluate and consider adding additional clinical stage development programs to our pipeline if we believe doing so can create incremental shareholder value in the near term 
we intend to focus our evaluation on development programs targeting infectious  respiratory and inflammatory diseases 
manage our preclinical research and general and administrative expenses at a level that is reasonably similar to our anticipated revenues 
we intend to manage our operations such that the costs of our preclinical research and our general and administrative activities are generally in line with revenue we anticipate receiving from royalties  milestones  and amounts permitted under our contract with barda 
by doing so  we intend to conserve a significant portion of our existing capital resources for use towards obtaining and advancing clinical stage development programs  other than laninamivir octanoate  in the future 
research and development our research and development expense in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in  we plan to focus our resources primarily on i the development of laninamivir octanoate  of which a majority of the related costs are fully reimbursable under the barda contract  ii nominating a preclinical candidate from our rsv fusion inhibitor program for advancement into ind enabling glp preclinical studies  and iii continuing research and preclinical activities with respect to our gram negative antibiotic compounds 
sales and marketing we currently do not have any commercialization or sales and marketing capabilities  and have no plans to invest in or build such capabilities internally in the near term  if ever 
at this time  other than potentially with respect to future sales of laninamivir octanoate  if approved  to government agencies for stockpiling purposes  we anticipate partnering or collaborating with  or licensing certain rights to other larger pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to support the commercialization of our product candidates 
however  other than our existing license and commercialization agreements with gsk and daiichi sankyo  we may decide not to license any commercialization rights to our product candidates in the future 
manufacturing we currently do not own or operate any facilities in which we can formulate  manufacture  fill or package our product candidates 
with respect to laninamivir octanoate  we currently rely on a single group of contract manufacturers to produce our api  the twincaps dry powder inhaler device  and to fill and package the materials required to conduct clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices  cgmp 
if an existing contract manufacture fails to deliver on schedule  or at all  or fails to manufacture our material is accordance with our specifications and or fda regulations  it could significantly delay or interrupt the development or commercialization of our product candidates and affect our operating results and estimated time lines 
we have used contract manufacturers to produce all the clinical trial material for use in the preclinical studies we have conducted to date  as well as for all clinical trials of vapendavir and laninamivir octanoate 
competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive 
many companies  including biotechnology  chemical and pharmaceutical companies  are actively engaged in activities similar to ours  including research and the development of product candidates for the treatment of infectious diseases 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources  larger research and development staffs  and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do 
in addition  some of them have considerable experience in preclinical testing  clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures 
there are also academic institutions  governmental agencies and other research organizations that are conducting research in areas in which we are working 
they may also market commercial products  either on their own or through collaborative efforts 
we expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop 
companies that complete clinical trials obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage 
the pharmaceutical market for products that prevent or treat influenza is very competitive 
key competitive advantages for laninamivir octanoate may include its single administration treatment regimen  its antiviral resistance profile  and to date  its reported safety profile 
a number of nis is currently available in the us and or other counties  including japan  for the prevention and or treatment of influenza 
these include oseltamivir phosphate from hoffmann la roche ltd 
roche  which is marketed as tamiflu  zanamivir from gsk  which is marketed as relenza  laninamivir octanoate from daiichi sankyo  which is marketed as inavir  and peramivir from shionogi co  ltd  which is marketed as rapiacta 
biocryst  inc has recently announced its intention to file a nda in the us for peramivir 
roche s and gsk s ni s are approved for both the prevention and treatment of influenza  and both roche and gsk have intravenous therapy formulations of oseltamivir and zanamivir in clinical development 
in addition to ni s  there are other companies working to develop additional antiviral drugs to be used against various strains of influenza 
further  several pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms  including major pharmaceutical companies  have announced efforts in the field of structure based drug design and in the therapeutic areas of cancer  infectious disease  autoimmune  and inflammatory disorders  as well as other therapeutic areas where we are focusing our drug discovery efforts 
we anticipate that our product candidates  and in particular laninamivir octanoate  if successfully developed and approved  will compete directly or indirectly with or drugs that will be generic by the time our product candidates may be approved for sale 
generic drugs are drugs whose patent protection has expired  and generally have an average selling price substantially lower than drugs protected by patents and intellectual property rights 
unless a patented drug can sufficiently differentiate itself from a directly competing generic drug in a meaningful manner  the existence of generic competition in any indication will generally impose significant pricing pressure on competing patented drugs 
intellectual property rights and patents patents and other proprietary intellectual rights are crucial in our business and industry  and establishing and maintaining these rights are essential to justify the development  advancement and commercialization of our product candidates and products 
we have sought  and intend to continue to seek  viable and strategic intellectual property rights  including  but not limited to  patent protection for our inventions and further  to rely upon patents  trade secrets  confidential information  know how  trademarks  improvements in our technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain a competitive advantage for our products and product candidates 
in order to protect our intellectual property rights  we typically require employees  consultants  collaborators  advisors  potential partners  service providers and contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us  generally stating that they will not disclose our confidential information to third parties for a certain period of time  and will otherwise not use our confidential information for anyone s benefit but ours 
the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
therefore  the patentability of subject matter we claim in our patent applications  the breadth of the claims ultimately granted  or their enforceability cannot be predicted 
for this reason  we may not have or be able to obtain or maintain worldwide patent protection for any or all of our products and product candidates  and our intellectual property rights may not be protected or legally enforceable in all countries throughout the world 
in some cases we may rely upon data exclusivity or similar exclusivities  although there is no guarantee that data exclusivity will be available or obtained in any jurisdiction 
further  as the publication of discoveries in the scientific and or patent literature often lags behind the actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions described in our patent applications or that we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions 
pursuant to the terms of the uruguay round agreements act  patents filed on or after june  in the u 
s 
have a term of years from the date of filing  regardless of the period of time it may take for the patent to ultimately issue 
this may shorten the period of patent protection afforded to our products as patent applications in the biopharmaceutical sector often take considerable time to issue 
under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  a sponsor may obtain marketing exclusivity for a period of time following fda approval of certain drug applications  regardless of patent status  if the drug is a new chemical entity or if new clinical studies were used to support the marketing application for the drug 
the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of also allows a patent owner to obtain an extension of applicable patent terms for a period equal to one half the period of time elapsed between the filing of an ind and the filing of the corresponding nda plus the period of time between the filing of the nda and fda approval  with a five year maximum patent extension 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of either the patent term extension or marketing exclusivity provisions of this law 
zanamivir  a first in class neuraminidase inhibitor approved for the treatment and prevention of influenza a and b  is marketed worldwide as relenza by gsk 
the relenza patent portfolio  which is solely owned by us and exclusively licensed to gsk  will begin to expire in our patents relating to relenza will expire in december in the us  may in australia  in the major countries of the european union  and july in japan 
laninamivir octanoate  a long acting neuraminidase inhibitor for the treatment and prevention of influenza a and b  is currently marketed as inavir in japan by daiichi sankyo 
the patent relating to the structure of laninamivir octanoate expires in in the us  eu and japan 
the patent relating to hydrates and the crystalline form of laninamivir octanoate used in the product expires in without extensions in the us and eu and in in japan 
the dry powder inhaler device patent portfolio  which known as twincaps and is owned by hovione international limited hovione and exclusively licensed to biota and daiichi sankyo for the prevention and treatment of influenza and other influenza like viral infections  expires in in the us  and in in the eu and japan 
vapendavir  an oral antiviral  has been in clinical development for the reduction of cold symptoms caused by hrv in patients with mild to moderate asthma 
the vapendavir patent portfolio is exclusively owned by us and will begin expire in some countries in december  without extensions 
we own a patent portfolio focused on developing an oral antiviral for rsv 
our rsv patent portfolio is comprised of a number of patent filings directed to several compound series  with the earliest projected expiries ranging from late to late we are the exclusive owner of a patent portfolio focused on developing oral iv antibiotics targeting gyrb pare with activity against gram negative and multi drug resistant bacterial pathogens 
the gyr patent portfolio comprises a number of patent filings directed to several compound series  with the earliest projected expiries ranging from mid to early patent term restoration extension and marketing exclusivity depending upon the timing  duration and specifics of fda approval for the intended use of our product candidates  some of our us patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  commonly referred to as the hatch waxman act 
the hatch waxman act permits a patent restoration term  or extension  of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the fda regulatory review process 
however  patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of years from the product s approval date 
subject to certain limitations  the patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of a nda plus the time between the submission date of an nda and the approval of that application  up to a total of five years 
only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension 
the application for such extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within days of the drug s approval 
the united states patent and trademark office uspto  in consultation with the fda  reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration 
similar provisions are available in europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug 
in the future  we may apply for restoration of patent term for one or more of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date  depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant nda 
market exclusivity provisions under the federal drug  food and cosmetic act fdca can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company s nda 
the fdca provides a five year period of non patent data exclusivity within the us to the first applicant to obtain approval of a nda for a new chemical entity 
a drug is a new chemical entity if the fda has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety  which is the molecule responsible for the action of the drug substance 
during the exclusivity period  the fda may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application  or an abbreviated new drug application anda  or a b nda submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval 
however  an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non infringement to one of the patents listed with the fda by the innovator nda holder 
the fdca also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an nda  b nda or supplement to an existing nda if new clinical investigations  other than bioavailability studies  that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the fda to be essential to the approval of the application  for example new indications  dosages or strengths of an existing drug 
this three year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the fda from approving andas for drugs containing the original active agent 
five year and three year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full nda 
however  an applicant submitting a full nda would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre clinical studies and adequate and well controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness 
pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity available in the us pediatric exclusivity  if granted  provides an additional six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms 
this six month exclusivity  which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or the patent term  may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with a fda request for such a study 
the current pediatric exclusivity provision was reauthorized in september as part of the food and drug administration amendments act 
licenses and agreements gsk in  we entered into a royalty bearing research and license agreement with gsk for the development and commercialization of zanamivir  a ni marketed by gsk as relenza to prevent and treat influenza 
under the terms of the agreement  we licensed zanamivir to gsk on an exclusive  worldwide basis and are entitled to receive royalty payments of of gsk annual net sales of relenza in the us  europe  japan and certain other countries and in australia  new zealand  south africa and indonesia 
daiichi sankyo in  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with daiichi sankyo related to the development of second generation long acting ni s  including laninamivir octanoate 
under the collaboration and license agreement  we and daiichi sankyo cross licensed the right to develop  make  use  sell or offer for sale  or import products based on our respective intellectual property related to our long acting ni s 
a primary focus of the agreement was for the parties to collectively seek third party licensees that would develop and commercialize the related long acting ni s on a worldwide basis 
in the event that the related intellectual property was out licensed to a third party  we and daiichi sankyo agreed to share equally in any future royalties  license fees  milestones or other payments received from such a licensee 
further  although it was the intention of the parties to seek a third party licensee or licensees worldwide  the parties retained the right to market or co market related products in the us and other markets outside of japan  and any sales made by either party in the us would result in the selling party paying the other party a royalty rate that was half of the royalty rate paid by any other third party licensee 
to date  there have been no third party licenses granted pursuant to this agreement  therefore a royalty rate on net sales outside of japan have not been established 
in march  we entered into a commercialization agreement with daiichi sankyo  pursuant to which it obtained exclusive marketing rights in japan for long acting ni s  including laninamivir octanoate  covered by the collaboration and license agreement between the parties 
in consideration for these rights  daiichi sankyo agreed to pay us a royalty rate equal to or potentially higher in certain circumstances  on net sales in japan 
in september  laninamivir octanoate inavir was approved for sale by the japanese ministry of health and welfare for the treatment of influenza in adults and children 
accordingly  under this agreement  we currently receive a royalty on net sales of inavir in japan and are eligible to earn sales milestone payments 
hovione on january   together with daiichi sankyo  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with hovione for the use of its proprietary dry powder inhaler technology for prevention and treatment of influenza and other influenza like viral infections with laninamivir octanoate or any other long acting ni selected by us or daiichi sankyo during the term of the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  in the event we sublicense laninamivir octanoate administered by the dry powder inhaler to a third party  we will owe hovione a sublicense fee and a royalty on net sales 
in the event we or daiichi sankyo commercialize laninamivir octanoate administered by the dry powder inhaler outside of japan  the terms  conditions  and any royalty rate due to hovione have not yet been determined 
the license agreement terminates with expiration of the last patent claim covering the dry powder inhaler intellectual property used 
barda contract for the development of laninamivir octanoate on march   we were awarded a contract from barda for the late stage development of laninamivir octanoate on a cost plus fixed fee basis  the total of which is not to exceed million 
barda is part of the us office of the assistant secretary for preparedness and response aspr within the us department of health and human services hhs 
pursuant to this contract  reimbursable costs include  but are not limited to  those incurred by the company for the clinical development  scale up  formulation and the design of a manufacturing facility needed to support the filing of a nda with  and the potential licensure of laninamivir octanoate by  the fda 
the performance period of the barda contract commenced on march   and continues for five years 
as of june   we have recognized revenue totaling million pursuant to this contract 
regulatory matters overview the preclinical and clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  storage  distribution  promotion  sale  export  reporting and record keeping of drug products and product candidates is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us  principally the fda and corresponding state agencies  and regulatory agencies in foreign countries 
non compliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  total or partial suspension of the clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of a product or product candidate  the failure of the fda or similar regulatory agency in other countries to grant marketing approval  the withdrawal of marketing approvals  fines  injunctions  seizure of products and criminal prosecution 
us regulatory approval pursuant to fda regulations  we are required to successfully undertake a long and rigorous development process before any of our product candidates can be marketed or sold in the us this regulatory process typically includes the following steps the successful completion of satisfactory preclinical studies under the fda s good laboratory practices glp regulation  the submission and acceptance of an ind that must be reviewed and accepted by the fda and become effective before human clinical trials may begin  the approval of an institutional review board irb at each site or location where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials  the successful completion of a series of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety  potency  efficacy and purity of any product candidate for its intended use  which conform to the fda s good clinical practice gcp regulations  the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes that conform to fda mandated current good manufacturing practices cgmps  and the submission to  and review and approval by  the fda of a nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product 
successfully completing this development process requires a substantial amount of time and financial resources 
we cannot assure you that this process will result in the granting of an approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all  or that we will have sufficient financial resources to see the process for any of our product candidates through to completion 
preclinical studies preclinical studies generally include laboratory  or in vitro  evaluation of a product candidate  its chemistry  formulation  stability and toxicity  as well as certain in vivo animal studies to assess its potential safety and biologic activity 
we must submit the results of these preclinical studies  together with other information  including manufacturing records  analytical data and proposed clinical trial protocols  to the fda as part of an ind  which must be reviewed by the fda and become effective before we may begin any human clinical trials 
an ind generally becomes effective approximately days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within this day time period  raises material concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the proposed trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold or partial clinical hold 
if one or more of our product candidates is placed on clinical hold  we may be required to resolve any outstanding issues to the satisfaction of the fda before we can begin  or continue  clinical trials of such product candidates 
preclinical studies supportive of an ind generally take a year or more to complete  and there is no guarantee that an ind based on those studies will become effective  allowing human clinical testing to begin 
certain preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the fda s glp regulations and the us department of agriculture s animal welfare act 
violations of these regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of the studies  requiring such studies to be conducted again 
clinical trials this clinical trial phase of drug development occurs after a successful ind submission  and involves the activities necessary to demonstrate the safety  tolerability  biologic activity  efficacy and dosage of an investigational new drug substance in humans  as well as the ability to produce the drug substance in accordance with the fda s cgmp requirements 
clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing  among other things  the objectives of the trial and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the activity or efficacy of the product candidate 
each clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind prior to beginning the trial 
each trial  and the related clinical protocol  must be reviewed  approved and conducted under the auspices of an irb and  with limited exceptions  requires the patient s informed consent to participate in the trial 
sponsors  investigators  and irbs also must satisfy extensive gcps  including regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects  complying with the protocol and investigational plan  adequately monitoring the clinical trial  and reporting any serious adverse events on a timely basis 
clinical trials to support a nda for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases phase  and data from these activities are compiled in a nda for submission to the fda requesting approval to market the drug 
these phases may be compressed  may overlap  or may be omitted in some circumstances 
the fda may also require sponsors to conduct phase clinical trials after market approval to study certain safety issues or other patient populations 
phase after an ind becomes effective  phase human clinical trials can begin 
a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or in certain cases  patients with the medical condition for which the product candidate is intended to be used 
generally  the purpose of a phase trial is to assess a product candidate s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate it at different dose levels 
absorption  metabolism  distribution and pharmacokinetic trials are also generally performed at this stage 
phase trials typically evaluate these aspects of the investigational drug in both single and multiple doses 
phase during phase clinical trials  a product candidate is generally studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to i further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks  ii assess the preliminary or potential effectiveness or biologic activity of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions  and iii assess dose tolerance and determine the optimal dose for a subsequent phase or phase trial 
phase trials generally involve patients who are divided into one or more groups that will get one of several dose levels of the product candidate  and a control group that is not treated with the product candidate but either receives a placebo or a drug already on the market for the same indication 
typically  two or more phase studies will be conducted for a product candidate prior to advancing to phase phase if and when one or more phase trials demonstrate that a specific dose or range of doses of a product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile  one or more phase trials may be undertaken to further demonstrate or confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of the investigational drug in an expanded patient population  with the goal of evaluating its overall risk benefit relationship 
phase trials are generally designed to reach a specific goal or end point  the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate s clinical efficacy 
the successful demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety in one or more phase trials is typically a prerequisite to the filing of a nda for a product candidate 
the sponsor of a clinical stage development program may request an end of phase meeting with the fda to assess the safety of the dose regimen to be studied in a phase clinical trial  to evaluate the planned design of a phase trial  and to identify any additional information that will be needed to support a nda 
if a phase clinical trial has been the subject of discussion at an end of phase meeting  the sponsor may be eligible for a special protocol assessment  spa  a process by which the fda  at the request of the sponsor  will evaluate the trial protocol and issues relating to the protocol to assess whether it is deemed to be adequate to meet the scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor 
if the fda and the sponsor reach agreement on the design and size of a phase clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in a nda  the fda may reduce the understanding to writing 
the spa  however  is not a guarantee of product approval by the fda  or approval of any permissible claims about the product 
throughout the various phases of clinical development  samples of the product candidate made in different batches are tested for stability to establish any shelf life constraints 
in addition  large scale production protocols and written standard operating procedures for each aspect of commercial manufacture and testing must be developed and validated 
phase   and testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical development and may  at its discretion  reevaluate  alter  suspend  or terminate further evaluation or trials based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to the patient 
the fda  the sponsor  a data safety monitoring board or an irb may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk 
the fda can also request additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval or advancement to the next stage of development 
additionally  new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of product candidates under development 
clinical trials performed outside the us under an ind must meet the same requirements that apply to studies conducted in the us the fda may also accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an ind if the study is well designed  well conducted  performed by qualified investigators  and conforms to the ethical principles contained in the declaration of helsinki  or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted  whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects 
certain information about clinical trials  including a description of the study  participation criteria  location of study sites  and contact information  is required to be sent to the national institutes of health  nih for inclusion in a publicly accessible database that is available at www 
clinicaltrials 
gov 
sponsors also are subject to certain state laws imposing requirements to make publicly available certain information on clinical trial results 
in addition  the food and drug administration amendments act of directed the fda to issue regulations that will require sponsors to submit to the nih the results of all controlled clinical studies  other than phase studies 
new drug applications nda if and when we believe that all the requisite clinical trials for a product candidate have been completed with satisfactory and supporting clinical  toxicology  safety and manufacturing related data  we must submit a nda to the fda in order to obtain approval for the marketing and sale of a product candidate in the us among many other items  a nda typically includes the results of all preclinical and toxicology studies and human clinical trials and a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods 
the fda must approve the nda prior to the marketing and sale of the related product 
the fda may deny or reject a nda if it believes all applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  or it may require additional data  including clinical  toxicology  safety or manufacturing data prior to approval 
the fda has days from its receipt of a nda to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for a substantive review before accepting it for filing 
the fda may request additional information rather than accept a nda for filing 
in this event  the nda must be amended with any additional information requested 
the fda may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee  typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
a nda can receive either standard or priority review 
a product candidate representing a potentially significant improvement in the treatment  prevention or diagnosis of a life threatening or serious disease may receive a priority review 
in addition  product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life threatening illnesses that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may also receive accelerated approval on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit  or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity 
priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval  but may expedite the approval process 
if the results of the fda s evaluation of the nda and inspection of manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue an approval letter 
an approval letter authorizes the commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication 
as a condition of nda approval  the fda may require post approval testing  including phase trials  and surveillance to monitor the drug s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions  including labeling or distribution restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of the drug 
once granted  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing 
if the fda determines that it cannot approve the nda in its present form  it generally issues what is referred to as a complete response letter 
a complete response letter will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the agency has identified in an application that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda 
if and when those conditions are met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will typically re review the application and possibly issue an approval letter 
however  even after submitting this additional information  the fda ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval 
it can take several years for the fda to approve a nda once it is submitted  and the actual time required for any product candidate to be approved may vary substantially  depending upon the nature  complexity and novelty of the product candidate 
we cannot assure you that the fda  or any other similar regulatory agency in another country  will grant approval for any of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
success in preclinical or early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
post approval regulations if and when a product candidate receives regulatory approval to be marketed and sold  the approval is typically limited to a specific clinical indication or use 
further  even after regulatory approval is obtained  subsequent discovery of previously unknown safety problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use  or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market 
any fda approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences 
further  drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and state agencies for compliance with cgmp regulations  which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers 
we cannot be certain that we  or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers  will be able to comply with cgmp regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in  among other things  total or partial suspension of production activities for our current and future product candidates  failure of the fda to grant approval for marketing of such product candidates  and withdrawal  suspension  or revocation of marketing approvals 
if the fda approves one or more of our product candidates  we and our contract manufacturers must provide the fda with certain updated safety  efficacy and manufacturing information 
product changes  as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other post approval changes may necessitate additional fda review and approval 
we rely  and expect to continue to rely  on third parties for the formulation and manufacture of clinical and commercial quantities of our products 
future fda and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution  or require substantial resources to correct 
the labeling  advertising  promotion  marketing and distribution of an approved drug or biologic product must also comply with fda and federal trade commission  ftc requirements which include  among others  standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  and promotional activities involving the internet 
the fda and ftc have very broad enforcement authority  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing the company to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures  fines  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
once an approval is granted  the fda may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market 
after approval  some types of changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims  are subject to further fda review and approval 
in addition  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized  and in some circumstances the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post marketing programs 
from time to time  legislation is drafted  introduced and passed that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval  manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the fda 
in addition  fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates 
it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted  or whether fda regulations  guidance or interpretations will change or what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action  either in the us or abroad  or the impact such changes could have on our business 
other us health care laws and compliance requirements in the us  our activities are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities in addition to the fda  including the centers for medicare and medicaid services formerly the health care financing administration  other divisions of the us department of health and human services eg  the office of inspector general  the us department of justice and individual us attorney offices within the department of justice  and state and local governments 
for example  sales  marketing and scientific educational grant programs must comply with the anti fraud and abuse provisions of the social security act  the false claims act  the privacy provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and similar state laws  each as amended 
pricing and rebate programs must comply with the medicaid rebate requirements of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of and the veterans health care act of  each as amended 
if products are made available to authorized users of the federal supply schedule of the general services administration  additional laws and requirements apply 
under the veterans health care act  vhca  drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including us department of veterans affairs and us department of defense  the public health service and certain private public health service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including medicare and medicaid 
recent legislative changes purport to require that discounted prices be offered for certain us department of defense purchases for its tricare program via a rebate system 
participation under vhca requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas  as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the federal acquisition regulations 
in order to distribute products commercially  we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state  including  in certain states  manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state 
some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution  including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain 
several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs  file periodic reports with the state  make periodic public disclosures on sales  marketing  pricing  clinical trials and other activities or register their sales representatives  as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other health care entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing  and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices 
all of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws 
foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the us  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop product candidates or sell any products outside of the us whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain similar approval by comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or the marketing of a product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
european union eu member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial 
under the eu regulatory systems  we may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all eu member states 
the centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes  products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes and products designated as orphan medicinal products and optional for those products which are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients 
the decentralized procedure of approval provides for approval by one or more other  or concerned  member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state  known as the reference member state 
under the decentralized approval procedure  an applicant submits an application  or dossier  and related materials draft summary of product characteristics  draft labeling and package leaflet to the reference member state and concerned member states 
the reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within days after receipt of a valid application 
within days of receiving the reference member state s assessment report  each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials 
if a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health  the disputed points may eventually be referred to the european commission  whose decision is binding on all member states 
pharmaceutical coverage  pricing and reimbursement significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical products for which we may obtain regulatory approval to market and sell 
in the us and other countries  sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval to sell will depend considerably on the availability of reimbursement from third party payers 
third party payers include government health administrative authorities  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
the process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product 
third party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list  or formulary  which might not include all of the fda approved products for a particular indication 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services  in addition to their safety and efficacy 
we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products  in addition to the costs required to obtain fda approvals 
our products may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective 
a payer s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved 
adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
in  the us government enacted legislation providing a prescription drug benefit for medicare recipients  which became effective at the beginning of government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval 
however  to obtain payments under this program  we would be required to sell products to medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation 
these plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act became law in the us  which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers 
we anticipate that this legislation will result in additional downward pressure on the price  if any  that we may receive for any approved product 
federal  state and local governments in the us continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of health care costs  including the cost of prescription drugs 
future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceutical products  including the product candidates that we are developing 
different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries 
in the eu  governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers 
some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed 
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval  some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of our particular drug products to currently available therapies 
other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines  but monitor and control company profits 
the downward pressure on health care costs in general  particularly prescription drugs  has become very intense 
as a result  increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products 
in addition  in some countries  cross border imports from low priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country 
the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval to sell may suffer if the government and third party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time 
even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval  less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks  together with the other information contained in this form k 
the occurrence of any of the following risks could materially harm our business  our financial condition  our ability to raise additional capital in the future  or ever become profitable 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose a portion or all of your investment in our common stock 
risks related to the development of our product candidates our success depends largely upon our ability to advance our product candidates through the various stages of drug development 
if we are unable to successfully advance or develop our product candidates  our business will be materially harmed 
even though we generate royalty revenue from two of our influenza products  all of our product candidates are in early stages of development and their commercial viability remains subject to the successful outcome of current and future preclinical studies  clinical trials  manufacturing processes  regulatory approvals and the risks generally inherent in the development of pharmaceutical product candidates 
failure to advance the development of one or more of our product candidates may have a material adverse effect on our business 
the success of our business ultimately depends upon our ability to advance the development of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  be able to consistently manufacture them in accordance with strict specifications and regulations  get these product candidates approved for sale by the fda or similar regulatory authorities in other countries  and ultimately have our product candidates successfully commercialized by us or a strategic partner or licensee 
we cannot assure you that the results of our ongoing research  preclinical studies or clinical trials will support or justify the continued development of our product candidates  or that we will receive approval from the fda  or similar regulatory authorities in other countries  to advance the development of our product candidates 
our product candidates must satisfy rigorous regulatory standards of safety  efficacy and manufacturing before we can advance or complete their development or they can be approved for sale 
to satisfy these standards  we must engage in expensive and lengthy studies and clinical trials  develop acceptable and cost effective manufacturing processes  and obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates 
despite these efforts  our product candidates may not offer therapeutic or other medical benefits over existing drugs or other product candidates in development to treat the same patient population  be proven to be safe and effective in current and future preclinical studies or clinical trials  have the desired effects  be free from undesirable or unexpected effects  meet applicable regulatory standards  be capable of being formulated and manufactured in commercially suitable quantities and at an acceptable cost  or be successfully commercialized by us or by our collaborators 
even if we demonstrate favorable results in preclinical studies and early stage clinical trials  we cannot assure you that the results of late stage clinical trials will be sufficient to support the continued development of our product candidates 
many  if not most companies in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries have experienced significant delays  setbacks and failures in all stages of development  including late stage clinical trials  even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing or early stage clinical trials 
accordingly  results from completed preclinical studies and early stage clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in late stage trials 
furthermore  even if the data collected from preclinical studies and clinical trials involving any of our product candidates demonstrate a satisfactory safety and efficacy profile  such results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval from the fda in the us or other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions  which is required to market and sell the product 
clinical trials are lengthy and expensive 
we incur substantial expense for  and devote significant time to  preclinical testing and clinical trials  yet cannot be certain that these tests and trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product 
for example  clinical trials require adequate supplies of clinical trial material and sufficient patient enrollment 
delays in patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times 
even if we or our collaborators successfully complete clinical trials for our product candidates  we or they might not file the required regulatory submissions in a timely manner and may not receive marketing approval for the product candidate 
we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will successfully progress further through the drug development process  or will result in a commercially viable product 
the continuation of our barda contract depends on our ability to meet development milestones previously agreed to with barda and on our compliance with certain operating procedures and protocols 
the termination  suspension or reduction of our contract with barda could adversely affect our business and impair our ability to further develop or commercialize laninamivir octanoate 
in  we were awarded a contract from barda for the late stage development of laninamivir octanoate 
under this contract  we are entitled to receive up to million in funding and we are relying on this funding to support the advanced development of laninamivir octanoate in the us barda may suspend or terminate this contract should we fail to achieve key objectives or milestones  or fail to comply with the operating procedures and processes approved by barda and its audit agency  the defense contract audit agency 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these milestones or continue to comply with these procedures and protocols  or that we will be able to successfully develop laninamivir octanoate under this contract 
if our contract with barda contract is terminated  suspended or significantly reduced  we will likely not have access to sufficient resources to continue to fund the development and commercialization of laninamivir octanoate  and our business could be adversely affected 
barda may not fully reimburse all the development costs required to support the approval of laninamivir octanoate in the us and we may need to expend additional financial resources to achieve a nda filing  which could harm our financial condition 
costs that can be reimbursed under our contract with barda are currently capped at million 
if we surpass this amount or otherwise materially alter the development plans for laninamivir octanoate  and barda does not agree to modify the scope of the contract plan  we may incur additional costs to complete the development of laninamivir octanoate and file a nda 
if the actual or perceived therapeutic benefits or the safety or tolerability profile of any of our product candidates  including laninamivir octanoate  are not equal to or superior to other competing anti infective treatments approved for sale or in clinical development  we may terminate the development of any of our product candidates at any time  and our potential profitability could be harmed 
we are aware of a number of companies marketing or developing various classes of anti infective product candidates or products for the treatment of influenza  rsv  hrv and bacterial infections 
many of these product candidates are either approved for sale or further advanced in clinical development than ours such that their time to approval and commercialization may be sooner than that for our product candidates 
accordingly  if at any time we believe that any of our product candidates may not provide meaningful therapeutic benefits  perceived or real  equal to or better than our competitor s products or product candidate s  or we believe such product candidates may not have as favorable a safety or tolerability profile as potentially competitive compounds  we may delay or terminate the future development of any of our product candidates at any time 
we cannot provide any assurance that the future development of any or our product candidates will demonstrate any meaningful therapeutic benefits over potentially competitive compounds currently approved for sale or in development  or an acceptable safety profile sufficient to justify its continued development 
we also anticipate that several drugs  such as oseltamivir phosphate tamiflu and zanamivir relenza  will compete with laninamivir octanoate for the treatment of influenza  if approved for sale 
we also believe a number of antibiotics  such as vancomycin  which is marketed by a number of manufacturers including abbott laboratories  cubicin marketed by cubist pharmaceuticals  inc  zyvox marketed by pfizer inc and avelox marketed by bayer for the treatment of bacterial infections  will compete with certain of our antibiotic product candidates if they are successfully developed and approved for sale 
furthermore  at the time our products may be approved  several of these competing products are likely to be generic drugs 
generic drugs are compounds that have no patent protection  and generally have an average selling price substantially lower than drugs that are protected by patents and intellectual property rights 
unless a patented drug can differentiate itself from generic drugs that treat or prevent the same condition or disease in a clinically meaningful manner  the existence of generic competition in any indication may impose significant pricing pressure on patented drugs 
accordingly  if at any time we believe that any of our product candidates may not provide meaningful therapeutic or safety benefits  perceived or real  over these generic drugs  we may delay or terminate its future development at any time 
we cannot provide any assurance that late stage clinical trials of our product candidates that may compete with generic drugs in the future will demonstrate any meaningful therapeutic or safety benefits over these drugs sufficient to justify its continued development 
further  if we successfully develop a product candidate and it is approved for sale  we cannot assure you that any real or perceived therapeutic benefits of our drug over generic drugs will result in it being prescribed by physicians or commanding a price higher than the existing generic drugs 
our product candidates may exhibit undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other approved pharmaceutical products  which may delay or preclude their further development or regulatory approval  or limit their use if approved 
throughout the drug development process  we must continually demonstrate the activity  safety and tolerability of our product candidates to obtain regulatory approval to further advance their clinical development  or to market them 
even if our product candidates demonstrate adequate biologic activity and clear clinical benefit  any unacceptable side effects or adverse events  when administered alone or in the presence of other pharmaceutical products  may outweigh their potential benefit 
we may observe adverse or serious adverse events or drug drug interactions in future preclinical studies or clinical trials of our product candidates  which could result in the delay or termination of their development  prevent regulatory approval  or limit their market acceptance if they are ultimately approved 
if the results of preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates  including those that are subject to existing or future license or collaboration agreements  are unfavorable  we could be delayed or precluded from the further development or commercialization of our product candidates  which could materially harm our business 
in order to further advance the development of  and ultimately receive marketing approval to sell our product candidates  we must conduct extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda or similar regulatory authorities in other countries  as the case may be 
preclinical studies and clinical trials are expensive  complex  can take many years to complete  and have highly uncertain outcomes 
delays  setbacks  or failures can and do occur at any time  or in any phase of preclinical or clinical testing  and can result from concerns about safety  tolerability  toxicity  a lack of demonstrated biologic activity or improved efficacy over similar products that have been approved for sale or are in more advanced stages of development  poor study or trial design  and issues related to the formulation or manufacturing process of the materials used to conduct the trials 
the results of prior preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials are not predictive of the results we may observe in late stage clinical trials 
in many cases  product candidates in clinical development may fail to show desired tolerability  safety and efficacy characteristics despite having favorably demonstrated such characteristics in preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials 
in addition  we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  preclinical studies and the clinical trial process  which could delay or impede our ability to advance the development of  receive marketing approval for  or commercialize our product candidates  including  but not limited to communications with the fda  or similar regulatory authorities in different countries  regarding the scope or design of a trial or trials  or placing the development of a product candidate on clinical hold until questions or issues are satisfactorily resolved  regulatory authorities or institutional review boards not authorizing us to commence or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site  enrollment in our clinical trials being delayed  or proceeding at a slower pace than we expected  because we have difficulty recruiting patients or because participants drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipated  our third party contractors  upon whom we rely to conduct preclinical studies  clinical trials and the manufacturing of our clinical trial materials  may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner  having to suspend or ultimately terminate a clinical trial if participants are being exposed to unacceptable health or safety risks  regulatory authorities or irbs requiring that we hold  suspend or terminate our preclinical studies and clinical trials for various reasons  including non compliance with regulatory requirements  and the supply or quality of material necessary to conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials being insufficient  inadequate or unavailable 
even if the data collected from preclinical studies or clinical trials involving our product candidates demonstrate a satisfactory tolerability  safety and efficacy profile  such results may not be sufficient to support the submission of a nda to obtain regulatory approval from the fda in the us  or other similar foreign regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions  which is required for us to market and sell the product 
several of our product candidates are being developed to treat seasonal respiratory infections  which could cause their clinical development to be more complex  take longer and cost more to complete than product candidates intended for non seasonal infections 
influenza  hrv and rsv are respiratory infections that generally occur much more frequently in the fall and winter months in any given region  as opposed to the spring and summer months 
accordingly  clinical trials being conducted in patients with these seasonal respiratory infections need to be conducted during the season in which the infections occur  and generally cannot be conducted year round in any one region of the world 
the seasonality of these respiratory infections generally requires us to plan to conduct clinical trials in both the northern and southern hemisphere in order to enroll these trials on a timely basis 
in the event we cannot enroll a sufficient number of patients during a season in any one region of the world  such as the northern hemisphere  we may need to also conduct the trial in countries in the southern hemisphere in order to meet our enrollment targets  which increases the complexity of these trial designs  exposes us to additional regulatory oversight in more countries  and generally increases the cost and time to conduct these trials 
in the event that the severity  nature and extent of influenza in any given year or season is moderate to mild  we may not be able to recruit a sufficient number of patients or clearly demonstrate the efficacy of laninamivir octanoate in a placebo controlled clinical trial  which would could materially harm our business prospects and financial condition 
to support a nda filing with the fda  we anticipate conducting several placebo controlled clinical trials of laninamivir octanoate with the primary efficacy endpoints designed to show in a statistically significant manner that laninamivir octanoate has superior clinical benefit as compared to placebo 
in the event the severity  nature and extent of influenza and its correlate symptoms are mild during the seasons in which we are conducting our clinical trials  we may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in the trial in a timely manner or demonstrate a statistical difference in outcomes between those patients that receive laninamivir octanoate and those that receive placebo 
this could result in the clinical trial failing to achieve its primary end point  which may cause us to have to repeat the trial  or barda to terminate our contract  either of which would materially harm our business prospects and financial condition 
if third party contract manufacturers  upon whom we rely to formulate and manufacture our product candidates  do not perform  fail to manufacture according to our specifications  or fail to comply with strict government regulations  our preclinical studies or clinical trials could be adversely affected and the development of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated  or we could incur significant additional expenses 
we do not currently own any manufacturing facilities 
we have historically used third party contract manufacturers and we intend to continue to rely on third party contractors at least for the foreseeable future  to formulate  manufacture  fill and package our product candidates 
our reliance on these third party contract manufacturers  which in some cases are sole sourced  exposes us to a number of risks  any of which could delay or prevent the completion of our preclinical studies or clinical trials  or the regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates  result in higher costs  or deprive us of potential product revenues 
some of these risks include  but are not limited to our third party contractors failing to develop an acceptable formulation to support late stage clinical trials for  or the commercialization of  our product candidates  our contract manufacturers failing to manufacture our product candidates according to their own standards  our specifications  cgmps or regulatory guidelines  or otherwise manufacturing material that we or regulatory authorities deem to be unsuitable for our clinical trials  our contract manufacturers being unable to increase the scale of  increase the capacity for  or reformulate the form of our product candidates 
we may experience a shortage in supply  or the cost to manufacture our product candidates may increase to the point where it adversely affects their cost 
we cannot assure you that our contract manufacturers will be able to manufacture our product candidates at a suitable scale  or we will be able to find alternative manufacturers acceptable to us that can do so  our contract manufacturers placing a priority on the manufacture of other customers or their own products  rather than ours  our contract manufacturers failing to perform as agreed or exiting from the contract manufacturing business  and our contract manufacturers plants being closed as a result of regulatory sanctions or a natural disaster 
manufacturers of pharmaceutical drug products are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda  the us drug enforcement administration dea and corresponding state and other foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with fda mandated cgmps  other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over our third party contract manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards and accordingly  failure by our third party manufacturers  or us  to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the manufacturer  which could significantly and adversely affect our business 
in the event that we need to change our third party contract manufacturers  our preclinical studies  clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed  adversely affected or terminated  or such a change may result in the need for us to incur significantly higher costs  which could materially harm our business 
due to regulatory restrictions inherent in the us and many other countries  as well as potential capacity constraints on manufacturing that occur from time to time in our industry  various steps in the manufacture of our product candidates are sole sourced to various contract manufacturers 
in accordance with cgmps  changing manufacturers may require the re validation of manufacturing processes and procedures  and may require further preclinical studies or clinical trials to show comparability between the materials produced by different manufacturers 
changing our current or future contract manufacturers may be difficult  if not impossible for us  and could be extremely costly  which could result in our inability to manufacture our product candidates for an extended period of time and therefore a delay in the development of our product candidates 
further  in order to maintain our development time lines in the event of a change in our third party contract manufacturer  we may incur significantly higher costs to manufacture our product candidates 
if third party vendors  upon whom we rely to conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials  do not perform or fail to comply with strict regulations  these studies or trials may be delayed  terminated  or fail  or we could incur significant additional expenses  which could materially harm our business 
we have limited resources dedicated to designing  conducting and managing preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we have historically relied  and intend to continue to rely  on third parties  including clinical research organizations  consultants and principal investigators  to assist us in designing  managing  monitoring and conducting our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we rely on these vendors and individuals to perform many facets of the clinical development process on our behalf  including certain preclinical studies  the recruitment of sites and patients for participation in our clinical trials  maintenance of good relations with the clinical sites  and ensuring that these sites are conducting our trials in compliance with the trial protocol and applicable regulations 
if these third parties fail to perform satisfactorily  or do not adequately fulfill their obligations under the terms of our agreements with them  we may not be able to enter into alternative arrangements without undue delay or additional expenditures  and therefore the preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed or prove unsuccessful 
further  the fda  or similar regulatory bodies in other countries  may inspect some of the clinical sites participating in our clinical trials or our third party vendors sites to determine if our clinical trials are being conducted according to gcp or similar regulations 
if we or a regulatory authority determine that our third party vendors are not in compliance with  or have not conducted our clinical trials according to applicable regulations  we may be forced to delay  repeat or terminate such clinical trials 
we have limited capacity for recruiting and managing clinical trials  which could delay or impair our timing to initiate or complete clinical trials of our product candidates and materially harm our business 
we have limited capacity to recruit and manage the clinical trials necessary to obtain approval by the fda or similar regulatory authorities in other countries 
by contrast  larger pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies often have substantial staff or departments with extensive experience in conducting clinical trials with multiple product candidates across multiple indications 
in addition  they may have greater financial resources to compete for the same clinical investigators  sites and patients that we are attempting to recruit for our clinical trials 
as a result  we may be at a competitive disadvantage that could delay the initiation  recruitment  timing and completion of our clinical trials and obtaining marketing approvals  if at all  for our product candidates 
if we are unable to retain or attract key employees  advisors or consultants  we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates in a timely manner  if at all  or otherwise manage our business effectively 
we have adopted an operating model that relies on the outsourcing of a number of responsibilities and key activities to third party consultants and contract research and manufacturing organizations in order to advance the development of our product candidates 
therefore  our success depends in part on our ability to retain highly qualified key management  personnel and directors to develop  implement and execute our business strategy and operations  and oversee the activities of our consultants and vendors  as well as academic and corporate advisors or consultants that assist us in this regard 
we are currently highly dependent upon the efforts of our management team to accomplish this 
in order to advance the development of our product candidates  we need to retain and be able to recruit certain key personnel  consultants or advisors with experience in a number of disciplines  including research and development  product development  clinical trials  medical affairs  government regulation of pharmaceutical products  manufacturing  business development  accounting  finance  human resources and information systems 
although we have not experienced material difficulties in retaining key personnel in the past  we may not be able to continue to do so in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we lose any key employees  or are unable to retain qualified key personnel  directors  advisors or consultants  the development of our product candidates could be delayed or terminated and our business may be harmed 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes 
as a result  we may be unable to compete successfully or develop innovative products  which could harm our business 
our industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
key competitive factors in our industry include  among others  the ability to successfully advance the development of a product candidate through preclinical and clinical trials  the efficacy  toxicology  safety  resistance or cross resistance  and dosing profile of a product or product candidate  the timing and scope of marketing approvals  if ever achieved  reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of competing products and pharmaceutical products in general  the availability of raw materials and qualified contract manufacturing and manufacturing capacity  manufacturing costs  establishing and maintaining intellectual property and patent rights and their protection  and sales and marketing capabilities 
we face significant competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  many of whom have substantially greater resources 
in japan  zanamivir relenza and laninamivir octanoate inavir compete with oseltamivir phosphate tamiflu 
a similar situation would likely exist if laninamivir octanoate is approved and marketed in territories outside japan 
in addition  a number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies and product candidates that will compete with our other product candidates and research programs 
these companies include specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical companies 
developing pharmaceutical product candidates is a highly competitive  expensive and risky activity with a long business cycle 
many organizations  including the large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies that have existing products on the market or in clinical development that could compete with our product candidates  have substantially more resources than we have  and much greater capabilities and experience than we have in research and discovery  designing and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  operating in a highly regulated environment  manufacturing drug substances  products and devices  and marketing and sales 
our competitors may be more successful than we are in obtaining regulatory approvals for their product candidates and achieving broad market acceptance once they are approved 
our competitors products or product candidates may be more effective  have fewer adverse effects  be more convenient to administer  have a more favorable resistance profile  or be more effectively marketed and sold than any product we  or our potential collaborators  may develop or commercialize 
new drugs or classes of drugs from competitors may render our product candidates obsolete or non competitive before we are able to successfully develop them or  if approved  before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing them 
we anticipate that we or our collaborators will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and drug classes enter the market and advanced technologies or new drug targets become available 
if our product candidates do not demonstrate any meaningful competitive advantages over existing products  new products or product candidates  we may terminate the development or commercialization of our product candidates at any time 
we also face  and expect we will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies for attracting investigators and clinical sites capable of conducting our preclinical studies and clinical trials  and for patients to participate in our clinical trials 
these competitors  either alone or with their collaborators  may succeed in developing product candidates or products that are more effective  safer  less expensive or easier to administer than ours 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals for their product candidates more rapidly than we can 
companies that can complete clinical trials  obtain required marketing approvals and commercialize their products before their competitors do so may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including certain patent and marketing exclusivity rights that could delay the ability of competitors to market certain products 
we cannot assure you that product candidates resulting from our research and development efforts  or from joint efforts with our collaborators  will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or product candidates in development 
we may be unable to successfully develop a product candidate that is the subject of collaboration if our collaborator does not perform or fulfill its contractual obligations  delays the development of our product candidate  or terminates our agreement 
we expect to continue to enter into and rely on license and collaboration agreements or other similar business arrangements with third parties to further develop and or commercialize some of our existing and future product candidates 
such collaborators may not perform as agreed upon or anticipated  may fail to comply with strict regulations  or may elect to delay or terminate their efforts in developing or commercializing our product candidates even though we have met our obligations under the arrangement 
a majority of the potential revenue from existing and future collaborations will likely consist of contingent payments  such as payments received for achieving development or regulatory milestones  and royalties payable on the sales of approved products 
milestone and royalty revenues that we may receive under these collaborations will depend primarily upon our collaborator s ability to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  our collaborators may decide to enter into arrangements with third parties to commercialize products developed under our existing or future collaborations using our technologies  which could reduce the milestone and royalty revenue that we may receive  if any 
in many cases  we will not be directly or closely involved in the development or commercialization of our product candidates and  accordingly  will depend entirely on our collaborators 
our collaborators may fail to develop or effectively commercialize our product candidates because they do not allocate the necessary resources due to internal constraints  such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise  limited capital resources  or the belief that other product candidates or internal programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval  or may potentially generate a greater return on investment  do not have sufficient resources necessary to fully support the product candidate through clinical development  regulatory approval and commercialization  are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  or de prioritize the importance of or otherwise diminish their support for developing and or marketing our product candidate or product due to a change in management  business operations or financial strategy 
should any of these events occur  we may not realize the full potential or intended benefit of our collaboration arrangements  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  a collaborator may decide to pursue the development of a competitive product candidate developed outside of our collaboration with them 
conflicts may also arise if there is a dispute about the progress of  or other activities related to  the clinical development or commercialization of a product candidate  the achievement and payment of a milestone amount  the ownership of intellectual property that is developed during the course of the collaborative arrangement  or other licensing agreement terms 
if a collaborator fails to develop or effectively commercialize our product candidates for any of these reasons  we may not be able to replace them with another collaborator willing to develop and commercialize our product candidates under similar terms  if at all 
similarly  we may disagree with a collaborator as to which party owns newly or jointly developed intellectual property 
should an agreement be revised or terminated as a result of a dispute and before we have realized the anticipated benefits of the collaboration  we may not be able to obtain certain development support or revenues that we anticipated receiving 
we may also be unable to obtain  on terms acceptable to us  a license from such collaboration partner to any of its intellectual property that may be necessary or useful for us to continue to develop and commercialize the product candidate 
we cannot assure you that any product candidates will emerge from any existing or future collaboration agreements we may enter into for any of our product candidates 
our early stage research and development efforts may not result in additional product candidates being discovered  which could limit our ability to generate revenues in the future 
our early stage research and discovery efforts may not lead to the development of any additional product candidates that may be suitable for further preclinical or clinical development to treat viral or bacterial infections 
the discovery of additional product candidates requires significant research and preclinical studies  as well as a substantial commitment of internal and or external resources 
many candidate or lead compounds that appear to be promising in early stages of discovery or research  fail to progress to become product candidates in preclinical studies or clinical trials 
there is a great deal of uncertainty inherent in the research and development process and  as a consequence  in our ability to advance the development of lead compounds to potentially promising product candidates 
we cannot assure you that our early research activities and efforts will yield any additional preclinical or clinical product candidates 
risks related to commercial matters we have a history of incurring net losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
we have a history of incurring net losses  some of which are significant 
we expect to incur additional net losses in the near term  and these losses could increase as our research and development efforts progress 
to become consistently profitable  we  or our collaborators  must successfully manufacture and develop product candidates  receive regulatory approval  successfully commercialize and or enter into profitable agreements with other parties and maintain existing and or obtain additional intellectual property rights 
it could be several years  if ever  before we receive significant royalties from any future license agreements or revenues directly from the sale of any products 
royalty revenues from our marketed products are unpredictable and subject to the seasonal incidence and severity of influenza  which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently earn royalty revenue from net sales of relenza and inavir  which are marketed by licensees 
although the royalty rates paid to us by our licensees are fixed at a proportion of our licensees net sales of these products  our periodic and annual revenue from these royalties has historically been variable and subject to fluctuation based on the seasonal incidence of influenza 
in addition  the return of products to our licensees is taken into account in the calculation of net sales for purposes of calculating the royalty revenue we receive and are in general unpredictable 
we cannot predict with any certainty what our royalty revenues are likely to be in any given year 
if significant safety  tolerability  resistance or drug interaction issues should arise with relenza and inavir  our future royalty revenue may be reduced  which would adversely affect our financial condition and business 
we currently earn royalty revenue from relenza and inavir  which are marketed by our licensees 
data supporting the marketing approvals and forming the basis for the safety warnings in the product labels for these products were obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration in limited patient populations and  in some cases  from post approval use 
as these marketed products are used over longer periods of time and by more patients  some with underlying health problems or taking other medicines  new issues such as safety  tolerability resistance or drug interaction issues may arise  which may require our licensees to provide additional warnings or contraindications on their product labels  or otherwise narrow the approved indications 
if serious safety  tolerability  resistance  drug interaction or any other significant issues arise with respect to these marketed products  sales of these products could be limited or abandoned by our licensees or by regulatory authorities  in which case our royalty revenue would decrease 
if government and third party payers fail to provide adequate reimbursement or coverage for our products or those we develop through collaborations  our revenues and potential for profitability will be harmed 
in the us and most foreign markets  product revenues or related royalty revenue  and therefore the inherent value of our products  will depend largely upon the reimbursement rates established by third party payers for such products 
third party payers include government health administration authorities  managed care organizations  private health insurers and other similar organizations 
third party payers are increasingly examining the cost effectiveness of medical products  services and pharmaceutical drugs and challenging the price of these products and services 
in addition  significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status  if any  of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
further  the comparative effectiveness of new products over existing therapies and the assessment of other non clinical outcomes are increasingly being considered in the decision by payers to establish reimbursement rates 
we may also need to conduct post marketing clinical trials in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products 
such studies may require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial resources 
we cannot assure you that any products we successfully develop will be reimbursed in part  or at all  by any third party payers in any country 
many governments continue to propose legislation designed to expand the coverage  yet reduce the cost  of healthcare  including pharmaceutical drugs 
in many foreign markets  governmental agencies control the pricing of prescription drugs 
in the us  significant changes in federal health care policy were recently approved and will mostly likely result in reduced reimbursement rates in the future 
we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement increased government control over reimbursement rates of pharmaceutical products 
in addition  we expect that increasing emphasis on managed care and government intervention in the us healthcare system will continue to put downward pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products there 
government cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any of our products that may be approved for sale in the future  which would limit our revenues and profitability 
accordingly  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceutical products may change before our product candidates are approved for sale  which could further limit or eliminate their reimbursement rates 
further  social and patient activist groups  whose goal it is to reduce the cost of healthcare  and in particular the price of pharmaceutical products  may also place downward pressure on the price of these products  which could result in decreased prices of our products 
if any product candidates that we develop independently or through collaborations are approved but do not gain meaningful acceptance in their intended markets  we are not likely to generate significant revenues 
even if our product candidates are successfully developed and we or a collaborator obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market them in the future  they may not gain market acceptance or utilization among physicians  patients or third party payers 
the degree of market acceptance that any of our products may achieve will depend on a number of factors  including the efficacy or perceived clinical benefit of the product  if any  relative to existing therapies  the timing of market approval and the existing market for competitive drugs  including the presence of generic drugs  the level of reimbursement provided by third party payers to cover the cost of the product to patients  the net cost of the product to the user or third party payer  the convenience and ease of administration of the product  the product s potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies  the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products  the actual or perceived existence  incidence and severity of adverse effects  the effectiveness of sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  and the scope of the product label approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that physicians will choose to prescribe or administer our products  if approved  to the intended patient population 
if our products do not achieve meaningful market acceptance  or if the market for our products proves to be smaller than anticipated  we may never generate significant revenues 
if we fail to enter into or maintain collaborations or other sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties to commercialize our product candidates  or otherwise fail to establish marketing and sales capabilities in the future  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
we currently have no infrastructure to support the commercialization of any of our product candidates  and have little  if any  experience in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
therefore  if we successfully develop any product candidate  and it is ultimately approved for sale  our future profitability will depend largely on our ability to access  arrange or develop suitable marketing and sales capabilities 
other than potentially the sale of laninamivir octanoate  if approved  to the us or other federal governments for stock piling measures  we anticipate that we will need to establish relationships with other companies  through license  collaboration  commercialization or similar marketing and sales agreements  to successfully commercialize and market our product candidates in the us and in other countries around the world 
to the extent that we enter into these types of agreements with other companies to sell  promote or market our products in the us or abroad  our product revenues  which may be in the form of indirect revenue  a royalty  or a split of profits  may depend largely on their efforts  which may not be successful 
in the event we decide to develop our own sales force and marketing capabilities  this may result in us incurring significant costs before the time that we may generate any significant product revenues 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified third parties or marketing or sales personnel  or be able to establish marketing capabilities or an effective sales force 
currency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could increase our costs and may cause our profitability to decline 
we collect and pay a portion of our revenue and expenses in currencies other than the us dollar 
therefore  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our operating results 
we retain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in us dollars and utilize foreign currency accounts for collection and payment of revenues and expenses for our subsidiaries 
any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
unless we reach an agreement with daiichi sankyo and hovione with respect to our commercial rights to laninamivir octanoate outside of japan  disputes between us and these parties may occur and could adversely affect our financial condition and business prospects 
pursuant to our agreement with daiichi sankyo  if the parties agree to license the commercial rights to laninamivir octanoate in territories outside japan to a third party licensee  we and daiichi sankyo share all licensing revenue equally 
the agreement does not  however  specifically address the respective rights or obligations of  or any consideration between  the parties in the event that either we or daiichi sankyo directly market laninamivir octanoate in territories outside japan and a license has not been granted to a third party licensee anywhere in the world 
further  the license agreement that we and daiichi sankyo collectively entered into with hovione for use of the twincaps dry powder inhaler provide we and daiichi sankyo with the exclusive right to import  export  make  use  distribute for sale  drug product comprised of laninamivir octanoate and the twincaps dry powder inhaler drug product worldwide in the field of preventing and or treating influenza infections 
the contract specifies what consideration is payable to hovione in the event drug product is marketed by a third party licensee other than we or daiichi sankyo outside of japan 
the agreement does not  however  specifically address the respective rights or obligations of  or any consideration between  the parties in the event that either we or daiichi sankyo directly market drug product in territories outside japan 
the consideration potentially payable to daiichi sankyo under our license with it  if any  or to hovione under our license with it  related to direct sales of laninamivir octanoate we may generate in territories outside of japan is uncertain 
if we fail to reach a mutually acceptable commercial agreement in the future with either daiichi sankyo  hovione  or both with respect to the development and marketing of laninamivir octanoate or drug product outside of japan  disputes could result  which could further result in arbitration  litigation or other legal proceedings  or delay our ability to generate significant revenue from the sale of such products outside japan 
such proceedings can be expensive and consume a significant amount of managements time 
we cannot assure you we will reach a satisfactory commercial agreement with daiichi sankyo or hovione in the future 
risks related to our contracts with the us government if barda suspends  cancels  or otherwise terminates our contract with them  our financial condition and business could be materially harmed 
barda is a us government agency and has certain contracting requirements that allow it to unilaterally control its contracts 
contracts with us government agencies typically contain termination provisions unfavorable to the other party  and are subject to audit and modification by the us government at its sole discretion  which can subject us to additional risks 
 these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally audit or object to our contract related costs and fees  and require us to reimburse all such costs and fees  suspend or prevent us from receiving new contracts or extending our existing contracts for a set period of time based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations  cancel  terminate or suspend our contracts based on violations or suspected violations of laws or regulations  terminate our contracts if doing so is in the government s best interest  including if funds become unavailable to the applicable governmental agency  reduce the scope and value of our contracts  and change certain terms and conditions in our contracts 
barda is able to terminate its contracts with us  either for its best interests or if we default by failing to perform in accordance with  or to achieve the milestones set forth in the contract schedules and terms 
termination for convenience provisions generally enable us to recover only our costs incurred or committed and settlement expenses on the work completed prior to termination 
the us government s determination to award any contracts may be challenged by an interested party  such as another competitor or bidder 
if such a challenge is successful  our contract or any future contract we may be awarded may be reduced  suspended or terminated  which would harm our financial condition and prospects 
the laws and regulations governing the procurement of goods and services by the us government provide procedures by which other bidders and interested parties may challenge the award of a government contract 
such challenges or protests could be filed even if there are not any valid legal grounds on which to base the protest 
if any such protests are filed  the government agency may decide to suspend our performance under the contract while such protests are being considered by the gao or the applicable federal court  thus potentially delaying delivery of payment 
in addition  we could be forced to expend considerable funds to defend any potential award 
if a protest is successful  the government may be ordered to limit or terminate any one or more of our contracts and reselect bids 
the government agencies with which we have contracts could also be directed to award a potential contract to one of the other bidders 
under our contract with barda  our operations  and those of our contractors  are subject to audit by the us government  a negative outcome to which could adversely affect financial condition and business 
us government agencies  such as the department of health and human services hhs and the defense contract audit agency  dcaa  routinely audit and investigate government contractors and recipients of federal grants 
these agencies evaluate a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
the dhhs and the dcaa also review the adequacy of  and a contractor s compliance with  its internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  estimating  compensation and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a contract will not be reimbursed  while such costs already reimbursed must generally be repaid 
if an audit identifies improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including  but not limited to termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or prohibition from conducting business with the united states government 
any contracts we have with us government agencies may lead to claims against us under the federal false claims act  and these claims could result in substantial fines and other penalties  which could harm our financial condition  reputation and prospects 
our us government contracts are subject to substantial financial penalties under the federal civil monetary penalties act and the federal civil false claims act 
under the false claims act s whistle blower provisions  private enforcement of fraud claims against businesses on behalf of the us government has increased due in part to amendments to the false claims act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government 
these whistle blower suits may be filed by individuals  including present and former employees 
the false claims act statute provides for treble damages and up to  per false claim 
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws  or any other us governmental regulation that applies to us  we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs  and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to adequately protect or expand our intellectual property related to our products or current or future product candidates  our business prospects could be harmed 
our business success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain and protect our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights or patents 
we will be able to protect our proprietary intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
the patent position of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies involves complex legal and factual questions  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be able to ultimately enforce our patents or proprietary rights 
therefore  any issued patents that we own or otherwise have rights to may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and may not provide us with the protection against competitors that we anticipate 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary intellectual property rights is uncertain because issued patents and other legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage 
our future patent position will be influenced by the following factors we  or our licensors  may not have been the first to discover the inventions covered by each of our or our licensors pending patent applications and issued patents  and we may have to engage in expensive and protracted interference proceedings to determine priority of invention  our  or our licensors  pending patent applications may not result in issued patents  our  or our licensors  issued patents may not provide a basis for commercially viable products  may not provide us with any competitive advantages  or may be challenged by third parties  and third parties may develop intellectual property around our or our licensors patent claims to design competitive intellectual property and ultimately product candidates that fall outside the scope of our or our licensors patents 
due to the extensive time required for the development  testing and regulatory review and approval of a product candidate  it is possible that before a product candidate of ours can be approved for sale and commercialized  our relevant patent rights may expire  or such patent rights may remain in force for only a short period following marketing approval 
we currently rely on certain patents to provide us and our licensees with exclusive rights for certain of our products 
when all patents underlying a license expire  our revenue from that license may cease  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace it with revenue from new or existing licenses 
our patents relating to relenza will expire in december in the us  may in australia  in the major countries of the european union  and july in japan 
the patent relating to the structure of laninamivir octanoate expires in in the us  eu and japan 
the patent relating to hydrates and the crystalline form of laninamivir octanoate used in the product expires in without extensions in the us and eu and in in japan 
the patent relating to the dry powder inhaler device used for inavir  known as twincaps expires in in the us  and in in the eu and japan 
patent expirations will in all likelihood adversely affect our ability to protect or maintain our direct product or royalty revenue 
also  patent rights may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies 
the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us  and certain countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights 
for example  we may not be able to prevent a third party from infringing our patents in a country that does not recognize or enforce patent rights  or that imposes compulsory licenses on or restricts the prices of life saving drugs 
changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the us and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property 
we may need to in license certain technologies to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we or our licensors do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the products or technologies licensed  or may otherwise be limited in scope 
in addition  we may not have total control over the patent prosecution of subject matter that we license from others 
accordingly  we may be unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we would over our own 
others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any pending or issued patents we own or license  and rights we receive under those issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
we cannot assure you of the degree of protection that will be afforded by any of our issued or pending patents  or those licensed by us 
we cannot be sure that any patents will be issued from the patent applications we own or have licensed or  should any patents issue  that we will be provided with adequate protection against potentially competitive products 
furthermore  we cannot be sure that patents issued or licensed to us will be of any commercial value  or that private parties or competitors will not successfully challenge these patents or circumvent our patent position in the us or abroad 
in the absence of adequate patent protection  our business may be adversely affected by competitors who develop comparable technology or products 
if a third party claims we are infringing on its intellectual property rights  we could incur significant expenses  or be prevented from further developing or commercializing our product candidates  which could materially harm our business 
our success will also depend on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary intellectual property rights of third parties 
this is generally referred to as having the freedom to operate 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property claims  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings  both in the us and internationally  involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  such proceedings are lengthy  costly and time consuming  and their outcome is highly uncertain 
we may become involved in protracted and expensive litigation in order to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others  or to determine whether we have the freedom to operate with respect to the intellectual property rights of others 
patent applications in the us are  in most cases  maintained in secrecy until approximately months after the patent application is filed 
the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made 
therefore  patent applications relating to product candidates similar to ours may have already been filed by others without our knowledge 
in the event that a third party has also filed a patent application covering our product candidate or other claims  we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding  known as an interference proceeding  in the uspto or similar proceedings in other countries  to determine the priority of invention 
in the event an infringement claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay substantial legal fees and other expenses to defend such a claim and  if we are unsuccessful in defending the claim  we may be prevented from pursuing the development and commercialization of a product candidate and may be subject to injunctions and or damage awards 
in the future  the uspto or a foreign patent office may grant patent rights to our product candidates or other claims to third parties 
subject to the issuance of these future patents  the claims of which will be unknown until issued  we may need to obtain a license or sublicense to these rights in order to have the appropriate freedom to further develop or commercialize them 
any required licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we need to obtain such licenses or sublicenses  but are unable to do so  we could encounter delays in the development of our product candidates  or be prevented from developing  manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates at all 
if it is determined that we have infringed an issued patent and do not have the freedom to operate  we could be subject to injunctions  and or compelled to pay significant damages  including punitive damages 
in cases where we have in licensed intellectual property  our failure to comply with the terms and conditions of such agreements could harm our business 
it is becoming common for third parties to challenge patent claims on any successfully developed product candidate or approved drug 
if we or our collaborators become involved in any patent litigation  interference or other legal proceedings  we could incur substantial expense  and the efforts of our technical and management personnel could be significantly diverted 
a negative outcome of such litigation or proceedings may expose us to the loss of our proprietary position or to significant liabilities  or require us to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we may be restricted or prevented from developing  manufacturing and selling our product candidates in the event of an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding  or if we fail to obtain necessary licenses 
confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property 
we also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology  especially where we do not believe patent protection is obtainable  or prior to us filing patent applications on inventions we may make from time to time 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes  we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate and academic partners  employees  consultants  outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property  and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements 
in addition  others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information  and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party 
enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult  expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the us may be less willing to protect trade secrets 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
risks related to owning our common stock our revenue  expenses and results of operations may be subject to significant fluctuations  which will make it difficult to compare our operating results from period to period 
our revenues have historically been highly variable 
royalty revenues we earn are derived from the net sales of products used for the treatment and or prevention of influenza 
influenza as a disease is seasonal and highly unpredictable  and sales of these products fluctuate in line with the nature and extent of the incidence and severity of influenza each season 
payments potentially due to us under our existing or any future collaborative arrangements  including any milestone and royalty payments  are generally intermittent in nature and are subject to significant fluctuation in both timing and amount  or may never be earned or paid 
in addition  the return of products to our licensees is taken into account in the calculation of net sales for purposes of calculating the royalty revenue we receive and are in general unpredictable 
further  revenue we record under our contract with barda in any given period is based on the reimbursable costs we incur during that period  which have and will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
accordingly  our quarterly and annual revenue may be highly variable  and comparisons to previous periods may be difficult to make 
our historical and current revenues may not be indicative of our ability to achieve additional payment generating milestones or royalties in the future 
we expect that our operating results will also vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as a result of the initiation and success or failure of preclinical studies or clinical trials  the timing of the formulation and manufacture of our product candidates  or other development related factors 
accordingly  our revenues  expenses and results of operations for any period may not be comparable to the revenues  expenses or results of operations for any other period 
the reporting requirements of being a company publicly traded on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq increase our overall operating costs and subject us to increased costs and regulatory risk that may negatively impact our business or our ability to raise capital in the future 
as a company publicly traded on nasdaq  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act  and the listing requirements of nasdaq 
further  section of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
in particular  management must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditor must perform their own assessment on our internal control over financial reporting 
this testing is expensive and requires the attention of our limited management resources 
the various financial reporting  legal  corporate governance and other obligations associated with being a publicly traded company on nasdaq in the us require us to incur significant expenditures and place additional demands and requirements on our board of directors and executive officers  as well as other administrative  operational and financial personnel and resources 
if we are unable to comply with these requirements in a timely and effective manner  we and or our executive officers may be subject to sanctions by the sec 
we expect that we will continue to incur additional expenses as a result of being a company that is publicly traded on nasdaq 
the price of our common stock price has been highly volatile  and your investment in us could suffer a decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors and events  including but not limited to our ability to successfully advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development  disclosure of any favorable or unfavorable data from our preclinical studies or clinical trials  or other regulatory developments concerning our preclinical studies or clinical trials  the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates  or those of our competitors  the approval or commercialization of new products by us or our competitors  and the disclosure thereof  variation  suspension or termination of the contract we have with barda  or its funding ability  novel scientific innovations by us or our competitors  rumors relating to us or our competitors  public concern about the safety or tolerability of our products  product candidates  or similar classes of compounds  litigation to which we may become subject  actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual revenue or operating results  changes in general conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in drug reimbursement rates or government policies related to such reimbursement  significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors  new regulatory legislation adopted in the us or abroad  changes in patent legislation in the us or abroad  our failure to achieve or meet equity research analysts expectations or their estimates of our business or prospects  or a change in their recommendations concerning us  the value of our common stock or our industry in general  termination or delay in any of our existing or future collaborative arrangements  future sales of equity or debt securities  or the perception that such future sales may occur  the loss of our eligibility to have shares of our common stock traded on the nasdaq global select market due to our failure to maintain minimum listing standards or other listed markets  changes in accounting principles or a restatement of previously reported financial results  failure to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of publicly owned companies under the exchange act and the sarbanes oxley act  and general economic conditions and capital markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and more specifically the nasdaq global select market  upon which our common stock trades  and the market for smaller biotechnology stocks in particular have historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
volatility in the market price for a particular biotechnology company s stock has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of that company 
market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
due to this volatility  you may be unable to sell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid  which could generate losses 
in order to develop our product candidates and support our operations beyond months from june  and continue as a going concern  we may need to raise additional capital 
such capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  which could materially harm our financial condition  business and business prospects 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents of million as of june   along with the anticipated proceeds from existing royalty bearing licenses for relenza and inavir and our contract with barda  will enable us to operate for a period of at least months from june  this estimate assumes that we continue current operations and development plans with our existing product candidates  but does not include the impact of in licensing or acquiring other clinical stage development programs  any other significant transaction or change in our strategy or development plans in the near future 
we currently do not have any commitments for additional future funding  nor do we anticipate that we will generate any significant incremental revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates in the foreseeable future 
therefore  in order to meet our anticipated liquidity needs beyond months to continue the development of our product candidates  or possibly sooner in the event we in license or acquire another clinical stage development program  enter into other transactions  change our strategy or accelerate our development plans  we may need to secure additional capital 
in the event we need to raise additional capital  we expect to raise it primarily through the sale of our common stock or other equity securities  as well as potentially through forms of debt financing or other financing vehicles we may enter into in the future 
funds from these sources may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and our failure to raise such funds could have a material adverse impact on our future business strategy  plans  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate capital is not available to us on acceptable terms in the future  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs  or delay or curtail our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
if additional capital is not available to us on acceptable terms  we may also need to obtain funds through license agreements  or collaborative or partner arrangements  pursuant to which we will likely relinquish rights potentially valuable rights to certain of our product candidates that we might otherwise choose to develop or commercialize independently  or be forced to enter into such arrangements earlier than we would prefer  which would likely result in less favorable transaction terms 
additional equity financings may be dilutive to holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant payment obligations and restrictive covenants that restrict how we operate our business 
the timing and extent of our future financing needs are uncertain and will depend on many factors  some of which are very difficult to predict and others that may be beyond our control  including the variability of future royalty revenue we may receive under our existing royalty bearing license agreements  continuing to receive sufficient revenue under our contract with barda to advance the development of laninamivir octanoate in the us  the development timelines and plans for our product candidates  including any changes to those timelines  plans or our strategy  the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates  the rate of enrollment in such clinical trials  and the results of these clinical trials the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting preclinical studies  and the results of these studies  the cost of scaling up  formulating and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials to evaluate our product candidates  whether we receive regulatory approval to advance the clinical development of our product candidates in a timely manner  if at all  the cost and time to obtain regulatory approvals required to advance the development of our product candidates  the scope and size of our research and development efforts  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish in the future  the cost to maintain a corporate infrastructure to support being a publicly traded company in the us on nasdaq  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims 
future issuances of shares of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline  even if our business is doing well 
the sale and issuance of additional shares of our common stock  or the perception that such future sales could occur  including sales by our directors  executive officers  and other insiders or their affiliates  could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities at a price we deem appropriate 
if we raise additional capital in the future  your level of ownership in us could be diluted or require us to relinquish rights 
any issuance of securities we may undertake in the future to raise additional capital could cause the price of our common stock to decline  or require us to issue shares at a price that is lower than that paid by holders of our common stock in the past  which would result in those newly issued shares being dilutive 
further  if we obtain funds through a debt financing or through the issuance of debt or preferred securities  these securities would likely have rights senior to your rights as a common stockholder  which could impair the value of our common stock 
any debt financing we enter into may include covenants that limit our flexibility in conducting our business 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others  which might require us to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property or product candidates that we would have otherwise retained 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future  and accordingly  you must rely on appreciation in the price of our common stock for any return on your investment in us 
we anticipate that we will retain our earnings  if any  for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  our common stock will likely only provide a return to stockholders in the event there is appreciation in its price 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  and the laws of delaware contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in our control or in our management 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and the laws of delaware  the state in which we are incorporated  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us or a change in our directors or management that stockholders may consider favorable 
these certain provisions allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors  provide that our stockholders may remove our directors only for cause  authorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock  the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors that  if issued  could operate as a poison pill to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors  establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings  limit who may call stockholder meetings  and contain a fair price provision 
in addition  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may  unless certain criteria are met  prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the voting rights on our common stock  from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time 
these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to remove and elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
risks related to other aspects of our business we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations of nabi biopharmaceuticals and biota holdings in a timely manner  if at all  which could increase our cost of doing business or harm our operations and business prospects 
on november  we were formed as a result of the merger of nabi and biota holdings limited  with the resulting organization being called biota pharmaceuticals  inc the relocation of the corporate headquarters and integrating the operations and financial and legal records between the organizations is still ongoing 
in addition  we appointed a new ceo and executive vice president in the us subsequent to the merger 
we may incur additional costs and consume a significant amount of management s time to integrate our us  australian and united kingdom operations  including information systems  financial records  reporting systems  internal controls and legal contracts  in a timely manner  if at all 
if a product liability claim is successfully brought against us for uninsured liabilities  or such claim exceeds our insurance coverage  we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards that could materially harm our business 
the use of any of our existing or future product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved pharmaceutical products may expose us to significant product liability claims 
we currently have product liability insurance coverage for our ongoing clinical trials in the amount of million 
such insurance coverage may not protect us against any or all of the product liability claims that may be brought against us in the future 
we may not be able to acquire or maintain adequate product liability insurance coverage at a commercially reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses 
in the event a product liability claim is brought against us  we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim  as well as uncovered damage awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us 
in the event any of our product candidates are approved for sale by the fda or similar regulatory authorities in other countries and commercialized  we may need to substantially increase the amount of our product liability coverage 
defending any product liability claim or claims could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
if our use of hazardous materials results in contamination or injury  we could suffer significant reputational or financial loss 
our research activities may involve the controlled use of certain hazardous chemical and biological materials from time to time 
notwithstanding the various regulations controlling the use and disposal of these materials  as well as the safety procedures we undertake  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
in the event of an accident or environmental discharge or exposure  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  which may negatively impact our operations  our financial resources or our ability to recruit new staff 
our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards to reduce taxable income generated in the future could be substantially limited or eliminated 
our ability to use our net operating losses is subject to limitations and re assessment due to ownership changes that have occurred or that could occur in the future  in the us  australia and the united kingdom 
depending on the actual amount of any limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards  a significant portion of our future taxable income could be taxable 
additionally  tax law limitations may result in our net operating losses expiring before we have the ability to use them 
in addition  financing and acquisition transactions that we may enter into in the future could significantly limit or eliminate our ability to realize any value from our net operating losses 
we have adopted a corporate strategy  a component of which reflects our intent to pursue in licensing  acquisition  co development  and other similar collaborative clinical stage development opportunities to better balance our pipeline 
we may be unable to implement or successfully execute on this component of our strategy on a timely basis  if at all  which could harm our business 
the number of clinical stage development programs available for in licensing  acquisition or co development are limited  and there are numerous other large pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies competing for these same opportunities 
many of these companies have greater capital resources  experience and capabilities than we have 
we may not be able to successfully identify or execute a transaction for any suitable in licensing  acquisition or co development candidates  or be able to do so on terms acceptable to us 
any transactions we may complete in the future or potential future strategic decisions we make may disappoint investors and depress the price of our common stock and the value of your investment in our common stock 
further  we may need to raise capital to acquire or support the transaction  incur acquisition fees or other non recurring charges  and face significant integration challenges and or management and business disruptions  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 
item properties we have entered into an operating lease for an office and laboratory facility located in melbourne  australia through july   as well as corporate offices in alpharetta  georgia through september  and office and laboratory facility in oxford  united kingdom through the total annual rent expense under these leases is approximately million 
we do not own any real property 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current business as a conducted  as well as our expected business for the foreseeable future

these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
references to we  us  and our refer to biota pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
references to notes refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein refer to item 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative anti infective products to prevent and treat serious and potentially life threatening infectious diseases 
we were incorporated in the state of delaware since and our corporate headquarters are located in alpharetta  georgia 
on november   nabi pharmaceuticals  inc nabi and biota holdings limited  a biopharmaceutical company based in melbourne  australia that had been listed on the australian stock exchange since  completed a merger  and renamed the resulting company biota pharmaceuticals  inc biota  the company  us or we 
former biota holdings limited shareholders retained approximately of our shares of common stock  while former nabi shareholders retained approximately as consideration for nabi s net assets  which consisted primarily of million in net cash on hand on the date of the merger 
as nabi had minimal ongoing activity with respect to its development programs or related operations at the time of the merger  our historical and current operations primarily reflect the operations of biota holdings limited 
due to the fact that former biota holdings limited shareholders held a significant majority of the voting interest in us upon the completion of the merger  the merger was accounted for as a reverse merger  such that  notwithstanding the fact that nabi was the legal acquirer  biota holdings limited was considered the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  the financial statements of biota holdings limited are treated as our historical financial statements  with the operating results of nabi being included therein beginning november  as a result of the reverse merger  the company adopted a june fiscal year end 
we are currently focused on developing oral  small molecule compounds to treat a number of viral infections 
our most advanced clinical stage program is laninamivir octanoate  a long acting neuraminidase inhibitor we are developing for the treatment of influenza a and b that is currently enrolling patients in a multi national phase clinical trial  which we refer to as igloo 
in addition to laninamivir octanoate  we are developing an orally bioavailable  preclinical compound for the treatment of rsv infections in children  the elderly and immunocompromised patients 
we also have a phase compound  vapendavir bta  which has been in clinical development for the treatment of human rhinovirus hrv infections in patients with mild to moderate asthma 
finally  we have a discovery stage program focused on novel antibiotics designed to treat gram positive and gram negative bacterial infections 
we previously developed zanamivir  a neuraminidase inhibitor ni  which is marketed worldwide by gsk as relenza for the prevention and treatment of influenza a and b 
gsk developed and markets relenza pursuant to a royalty bearing research and license agreement we entered into with it in in  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with daiichi sankyo  under which each party cross licensed its intellectual property related to second generation long acting neuraminidase inhibitors lani  including flunet and laninamivir octanoate 
in  we entered into a separate commercialization agreement with daiichi sankyo  which provided it an exclusive license to laninamivir octanoate in japan and entitled us a royalty on net sales of laninamivir octanoate in japan 
in september  laninamivir octanoate was approved for sale by the japanese ministry of health and welfare for the treatment of influenza a and b in adults and children 
laninamivir octanoate is marketed in japan by daiichi sankyo as inavir 
in  we have filed an investigational new drug application ind with the fda to develop laninamivir octanoate in the u 
s  and in we were awarded a contract from the us office of biomedical advanced research and development authority barda designed to provide up to million in support of the development of and submission for a new drug application nda of laninamivir octanoate for the treatment of influenza a and b infections in the united states 
in june  we initiated phase igloo clinical trial of laninamivir octanoate under this ind 
although several of our influenza product candidates have been successfully developed and commercialized by other larger pharmaceutical companies under collaboration  license or commercialization agreements with us  we have not independently developed or received regulatory approval for any product candidate  and we do not currently have any sales  marketing or commercial capabilities 
therefore  it is possible that we may not successfully derive any significant product revenues from any of our existing or future development stage influenza or other product candidates that we are developing now  or may develop in the future 
we plan to continue to finance our operations with i our existing cash and cash equivalents  ii proceeds from existing or potential future royalty bearing licenses  government contracts  or collaborative research and development arrangements  iii future equity and or debt financings  or iv other financing arrangements 
our ability to continue to support our operations is dependent  in the near term  upon us managing our cash resources  our continued receipt of service revenue from barda  royalty revenue under our exiting licensees  entering into future collaboration  license or commercialization agreements  the successful development of laninamivir octanoate and to a lesser extent  our other product candidates  executing future financings and ultimately  upon the approval of our products for sale and achieving positive cash flows from operations on a consistent basis 
there can be no assurance that additional capital or funds will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  or we will be able to enter into collaboration  license or commercialization agreements in the future  or that we will ever generate significant product revenue and become operationally profitable on a consistent basis 
recent corporate developments laninamivir octanoate on june  we announced that we had commenced dosing in a multi national  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  parallel arm phase clinical trial of laninamivir octanoate  a long acting neuraminidase inhibitor the company is developing for the treatment of influenza a and b 
the trial  referred to as igloo  is designed to enroll subjects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mg and mg of laninamivir octanoate as compared with placebo  all delivered by a twincaps inhaler in adults with symptomatic influenza a or b infection 
we initiated igloo in several countries in the southern hemisphere  with a goal of completing enrollment in the trial by the end of the upcoming flu season in the northern hemisphere and having top line data available from the trial in mid changes to the board of directors on may  august  and september  we announced various changes to our board of directors  namely the resignations of dr 
raafat fahim  mr 
paul bell  dr 
jeffrey errington and mr 
peter cook as well the appointments of ms 
anne m 
vanlent  mr 
michael r 
dougherty and mr 
john richard to fill those vacancies 
vapendavir bta on september  we reported that we no longer plan to independently continue the clinical development of vapendavir in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  but rather intend to seek collaboration  co development or license arrangements with third parties to advance its clinical development 
in march  we completed a patient  phase b clinical trial that evaluated the safety and clinical benefit of vapendavir for the treatment of human rhinovirus hrv infections in patients with mild to moderate asthma 
the trial successfully met its primary endpoint  which was a reduction of cold symptoms based on the wisconsin upper respiratory symptom survey wurss severity score 
relenza royalty revenue on september   we reported that due to a recent increase in the amount of returns of relenza from distributors to glaxosmithkline  we recorded no royalty revenue in the quarter ended june   and anticipate earning an equal or lesser amount of royalty revenue from net sales of relenza in fiscal than in financial operations overview revenue 
we have historically generated revenue primarily from royalty payments  license fees  milestone payments  payments for services performed pursuant to contracts  such as the barda contract  as well as certain early stage research and development activities pursuant to collaborations with other entities 
revenues are earned when the underlying service is rendered and all contingencies have been satisfied 
revenue for royalties is recognized when the net sales of the underlying product by the relevant third party becomes determinable for the royalty period defined in each agreement 
in  we anticipate revenue from services to increase due to the clinical advancement of laninamivir octanoate  and for royalty revenue to remain the same or decrease from levels 
in  we expect our royalty revenues will decrease from levels as royalties from net sales of relenza will likely decrease due to the fact that the underlying patents will expire in the us near the end of calendar cost of revenue 
cost of revenue represents expenses incurred by us in performing services and activities pursuant to government contracts or grants for which we record related revenue and expense on the gross basis of accounting 
cost of revenue expense  the vast majority of which relates to the barda contract  includes  but is not limited to  the cost of third party service providers incurred in connection with conducting external preclinical studies and treating patients enrolled in clinical trials and monitoring  accumulating and evaluating the related clinical data  salaries and personnel related expenses for our internal staff allocated to a contract or grant  including benefits  and  the cost to develop  formulate and manufacture product candidates directly allocated to the specific contract 
cost of revenue expenses are expensed as incurred 
in  we expect our cost of revenue to increase from due to the clinical advancement of laninamivir octanoate 
research and development expense 
research and development expense generally includes the cost of activities associated with the discovery  preclinical development  and clinical development of our product candidates other than those captured under cost of revenue 
these costs include  but are not limited to  fees paid to third party service providers in connection with conducting external preclinical studies and treating patients enrolled in clinical trials and monitoring  accumulating and evaluating the related clinical data  salaries and personnel related expenses for our internal staff  including benefits and share based compensation  the cost to develop  formulate and manufacture product candidates  legal fees associated with patents and intellectual property related to our product candidates  research consulting fees  license expenses and sponsored research fees paid to third parties  and specialized information systems  depreciation and laboratory facility costs 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
we anticipate that our research and development expense will decrease in  as compared to  due to a reduction in the number of preclinical programs we expect to focus on in  which are our preclinical rsv and gyrb pare antibiotic programs  and our decision not to independently advance the clinical development of vapendavir 
due to the early stage nature of our preclinical programs  our future research and development expense may be highly variable in future periods depending on the results of these activities 
from time to time  we will make determinations as to how much funding or resources to direct to these programs in response to their scientific  clinical and regulatory status  anticipated market opportunity and the availability of capital to fund our programs 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our existing or future product candidates  if at all  and some of the possible consequences of failing to do so  is set forth in the risk factors section of this form k 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense reflects the costs incurred to manage and support our research and development activities  operations  contracts and grants  and status as a publicly traded company 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  including share based compensation for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  business development and human resources functions 
other significant costs include professional fees for legal  auditing  tax  and consulting services  insurance premiums  other expenses incurred as a result of being publicly traded  and depreciation and facility expenses 
in  we expect our general and administrative expense to decrease from our expense levels as included a number of non recurring expenses associated with the merger 
foreign exchange gain or loss 
foreign exchange gain or loss primarily relates to translation of foreign currency balances in our subsidiaries that have a different functional currency than the reporting currency of the parent per asc  foreign currency matters 
other income expense 
other income and expense has historically consisted of the proceeds from the gain or loss on the disposal of equipment  research and development tax grants and interest income 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our current financial condition and historical results of operations are based on our audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are important in understanding our financial statements and operating results 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformance with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the selection and application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable at the time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities 
actual future results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue as we perform services or fulfill contractual obligations under licensing and other collaborative research and development agreements 
revenue from royalties is recognized when the net sales of the underlying product by the relevant third party licensee becomes determinable for the royalty period defined in each agreement 
revenue for services performed pursuant to contracts or grants is recognized as revenue when earned  typically when the underlying services or activities are rendered 
revenue for collaborative research and development activities typically consists of fees for services  or payments when specific milestones are met and match underlying activities occurring during the term of the arrangement 
accrued expenses 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to estimate expenses that we believe have been incurred but for which we have not yet received invoices from our vendors  or for employee services that have not been paid 
this process primarily involves identifying services and activities that have been performed by third party vendors on our behalf and estimating the level to which they have been performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of expenses for which we generally accrue based on estimates include fees for services  such as those provided by clinical research and data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with the conduct of our clinical trials  research organizations that perform preclinical studies  and fees owed to contract manufacturers in connection with the formulation or manufacture of materials for our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in order to estimate costs incurred to date and evaluate the adequacy of a related accrued liability  we monitor and analyze the progress and related activities  the terms of the underlying contract or agreement  any invoices received and the budgeted costs 
we make these estimates based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with gaap 
share based compensation we use the black scholes method to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
our forfeiture rate is based on historical experience as well as anticipated turnover and other qualitative and quantitative factors  which may change over time 
there may be adjustments to future periods if actual forfeitures differ from current estimates 
our time based awards are issued with graded vesting 
the compensation cost of these graded vesting awards is recognized on the straight line method 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu  which amended the disclosure requirements regarding offsetting assets and liabilities of derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements  reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements 
the enhanced disclosures will require entities to provide both net and gross information for these assets and liabilities 
the amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january  we do not anticipate that this amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
the asu adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and is intended to help entities improve the transparency of changes in other comprehensive income and items reclassified out of aoci in their financial statements 
the new disclosure requirements became effective for us for all interim and annual financial statement reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not change the recognition or measurement of net income or accumulated other comprehensive income

the following table summarizes the components of our research and development expense for and june  in millions direct preclinical  clinical and product development expenses salaries  benefits and share based compensation expenses other expenses depreciation and facility related expenses total research and development expense direct preclinical  clinical and product development expense decreased in due to a million decrease in clinical expenses related to the completion of a phase vapendavir trial in and a decrease in preclinical manufacturing expenses of million  offset in part by higher preclinical development expenses of million 
salaries  benefits and share based compensation decreased in due primarily to more staff being deployed on to the laninamivir octanoate program in under the barda contract  as well as lower consulting and professional fees 
other expenses decreased in primarily due to lower intellectual property related expenses

the following table summarizes the components of our general and administrative expense for and june  in millions salaries  benefits and share based compensation expenses professional and legal fees expenses other expenses total general and administrative expense salaries  benefits and share based compensation increased due to additional personnel 
professional and legal fees expenses increased in due primarily to merger related expenses incurred in other expenses increased in primarily due to higher other expenses associated with the merger 
other income expense 
other income decreased in due to lower interest income as result of lower available interest rates in as compared to  as well as lower average cash balances held in compared to liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception in through june   we have funded our operations primarily with public offerings and license fees  royalties  research agreements and grants 
in  we were awarded a contract by barda for the late stage development of laninamivir octanoate on a cost plus fixed fee basis  the total of which is not to exceed million 
the performance period of the barda contract commenced on march   and continues for five years 
to date revenue totaling million has been recognized to date pursuant to this contract 
at june   our cash and cash equivalents were million and we held no investments with a maturity greater than months 
our cash and cash equivalents are generally held in a variety of interest bearing short term deposits with large us and australian banks 
cash flows for the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents increased by million  from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of million of cash received as a result of the merger  offset in part by cash used for operating activities and other investing activities during the period 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  which reflected our net loss for the period of million that included a gain of million we recorded as a result of the merger  an increase in net operating assets of million  offset in part by non cash charges for share based compensation and depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in operating liabilities of million 
our net loss resulted largely from our funding of research and development activities including basic research conducting preclinical studies  manufacturing and formulation expenses  incurring ongoing general and administrative expenses  as well as expenses associated with the merger  offset in part by revenue from services  royalty and other revenue from grants and collaborations  a million gain we recorded pursuant to the merger  the receipt of a million research and development credit  and interest income 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities reflects a million increase in accounts receivable due to higher contract revenue billed or accrued  a million increase in prepaid expenses  and a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset in part by an increase of million in accrued severance obligations related to the merger and a million decrease in deferred tax assets 
net cash provided from investing activities during was million  which was due to million in cash we received pursuant to the merger  offset in part by million for the purchase of laboratory and computer equipment 
funding requirements our future funding requirements are difficult to determine and will depend on a number of factors  including the variability of future royalty revenue we may receive from existing royalty bearing license agreements  whether we continue to receive sufficient revenue under our contract with barda to advance the development of laninamivir octanoate in the us  the development timelines and plans for our product candidates  including any changes to those timelines  plans or our strategy  the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates  the rate of enrolment in such clinical trials  and the results of these clinical trials the variability  timing and costs associated with conducting preclinical studies  and the results of these studies  the cost of scaling up  formulating and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials to evaluate our product candidates  whether we receive regulatory approval to advance or begin the clinical development of our product candidates in a timely manner  if at all  the cost and time to obtain regulatory approvals required to advance the development of our product candidates  the scope and size of our research and development efforts  our pursuit  timing and the terms of any in licensing  acquisition  co development  and other similar collaborative clinical stage development opportunities we may pursue in the future to better balance our pipeline  the size and cost of general and administrative function we need to manage our operations  including the infrastructure to support being a publicly traded company  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims 
based on our current strategy and operating plan  and considering the potential costs associated with advancing the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents of million as of june   along with the anticipated proceeds from existing royalty bearing licenses and revenue from our contract with barda will enable us to operate for a period of at least months from june  we currently do not have any commitments for future funding  nor do we anticipate that we will generate significant revenue  aside from revenue from existing royalty bearing arrangements  and our barda contract 
therefore  in order to meet our anticipated liquidity needs beyond months to support the development of our product candidates  or possibly sooner in the event we enter into other transactions or revise our strategy or development plans  we may need to raise or secure additional capital 
if we do  we would expect to do so primarily through the sale of additional common stock or other equity securities  as well as through proceeds from future licensing agreements  strategic collaborations  forms of debt financing  or any other financing arrangement 
funds from these sources may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and our failure to raise such funds could have a material adverse impact on our future business strategy and plans  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available to us on acceptable terms in the future  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more  if not all  of our research and development programs  or delay or curtail preclinical studies and clinical trials  or reduce our internal cost structure 
if additional capital is not available to us on acceptable terms  we may need to obtain funds through license agreements  or collaborative or partner arrangements pursuant to which we will likely relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise choose to develop or commercialize independently  or be forced to enter into such arrangements earlier than we would prefer  which would likely result in less favorable transaction terms 
additional equity financings may be dilutive to holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant payment obligations and restrictive covenants that restrict how we operate our business 
contractual obligations and commitments we have entered into an operating lease for an office and laboratory facility located in melbourne  australia through july   as well as corporate offices in alpharetta  georgia through september  and office and laboratory facility in oxford  united kingdom through the total annual rent expense under these leases is approximately million 
in connection with the development of laninamivir octanoate we have open reimbursable purchase orders with third party vendors for goods and services of million as of june  as of june   future payments under these non cancellable operating leases and purchase obligations are as follows in millions payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations the above contractual obligations table does not include any amounts or payments related to development  regulatory  or commercialization milestones  as the payments are contingent on the achievement of these milestones  which has not occurred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is currently confined to interest earnings  as our cash and cash equivalents are invested in liquid money market funds and short term deposits 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on june   this change would not have had a material effect on future earnings or cash flows 
our exposure to credit risk is managed through our policy that specifies credit quality standards for our cash deposits and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single party 
we place any excess cash not needed to fund operations with high credit quality financial institutions in order to limit the amount of credit exposure 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we report our financial results in us dollars  however we conduct business in foreign countries 
for us reporting purposes  we translate all assets and liabilities of our non us entities at the period end exchange rate and revenue and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the periods 
the net effect of these translation adjustments is shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as a component of stockholders equity 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue and collect receivables in foreign currencies 
similarly  we incur expenditure in foreign currencies and fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against major foreign currencies  including the euro  british pound  japanese yen and australian dollar  which can result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses that may significantly impact our financial results 
continued currency exposure to fluctuation in these exchange rates could result in financial results that are not comparable from quarter to quarter  or year to year 
with respect to work performed under the barda contract  we give priority to service providers who bill in us dollars to match our contract  which is settled in us dollars 
where appropriate  we hold cash reserves in currencies in which those reserves are anticipated to be expended
