item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary our business 
we operate outpatient physical therapy clinics that provide pre and post operative care and treatment for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries  neurologically related injuries and rehabilitation of injured workers 
during  and  we completed the following multi clinic acquisitions acquisition date interest acquired number of clinics may acquisition may july acquisition july february acquisition february december  acquisition december december  acquisition december in addition to the clinics in the may acquisition  in  the company acquired clinic practices in separate transactions 
two of the acquired clinic practices operate in two new partnerships and the remaining operate as satellites of existing partnerships 
in  the company acquired two clinic practices in two separate transactions 
both practices were consolidated into existing company clinics 
the results of operations of the acquired clinics have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of their acquisition 
at december   we operated clinics in states  inclusive of a physician services clinic 
the average age of our clinics at december  was years 
in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with third party facilities under management as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized in the period in which services are rendered 
net patient revenues patient revenues less estimated contractual adjustments are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from insurance companies  third party payors  patients and others for services rendered 
the company has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to the company at contracted amounts different from its established rates 
the allowance for estimated contractual adjustments is based on terms of payor contracts and historical collection and write off experience 
revenues from physician services  sold primarily through franchisee arrangements  are considered multiple deliverables training and ongoing services 
each component can be purchased separately 
revenue is recognized over the period the respective services are provided 

table of contents contractual allowances 
contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and expected reimbursements by both insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs for such services 
medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services provided in our clinics 
we estimate contractual allowances based on our interpretation of the applicable regulations  payor contracts and historical calculations 
each month the company estimates its contractual allowance for each clinic based on payor contracts and the historical collection experience of the clinic and applies an appropriate contractual allowance reserve percentage to the gross accounts receivable balances for each payor of the clinic 
based on our historical experience  calculating the contractual allowance reserve percentage at the payor level is sufficient to allow us to provide the necessary detail and accuracy with our collectibility estimates 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
payor terms are periodically revised necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimates made by management 
our billing system may not capture the exact change in our contractual allowance reserve estimate from period to period 
therefore  in order to assess the accuracy of our revenues and hence our contractual allowance reserves  our management regularly compares its cash collections to corresponding net revenues measured both in the aggregate and on a clinic by clinic basis 
in the aggregate  the historical difference between net revenues and corresponding cash collections has generally reflected a difference within approximately of net revenues 
additionally  analysis of subsequent period s contractual write offs on a payor basis reflects a difference within approximately between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage as compared to the estimated contractual allowance reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance 
as a result  we believe that a reasonable likely change in the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not be more than at december  for purposes of demonstrating the sensitivity of this estimate on the company s financial condition  a one percent increase or decrease in our aggregate contractual allowance reserve percentage would decrease or increase  respectively  net patient revenue by approximately  for the year ended december  management believes the changes in the estimate of the contractual allowance reserve for the periods ended december   and have not been material to the statement of operations 
the following table sets forth information regarding our patient accounts receivable as of the dates indicated in thousands december  gross patient accounts receivable less contractual allowances subtotal accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts net patient accounts receivable the following table presents our patient accounts receivable aging by payor class as of the dates indicated in thousands december  december  current to current to payor days days total days days total managed care commercial plans medicare medicaid workers compensation self pay other totals workers compensation is paid by state administrators or their designated agents 
other includes primarily litigation claims and  to a lesser extent  vehicular insurance claims 

table of contents reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
for a more complete description of our third party revenue sources  see business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each clinic 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experience with particular payors to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have a large number of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus  require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our aggregate allowance for doubtful accounts is regularly reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount to be recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
we do not believe that we have any significant uncertain tax positions at december   nor is this expected to change within the next twelve months due to the settlement and expiration of statutes of limitation 
we did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits nor was any interest expense recognized during the twelve months ended december  and carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
the accounting standards require that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 
goodwill 
the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually and upon the occurrence of certain events  and are written down to fair value if considered impaired 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis in its third quarter by comparing the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit including related goodwill 
we operate a one segment business which is made up of various clinics within partnerships 
the partnerships are components of regions and are aggregated to the operating segment level for the purpose of determining our reporting units when performing our annual goodwill impairment test 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of a reporting unit  inclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets  exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using two factors i earnings prior to taxes  depreciation and amortization for the reporting unit multiplied by a price earnings ratio used in the industry and ii a discounted cash flow analysis 
a weight is assigned to each factor and the sum of each weight times the factor is considered the estimated fair value 
for  the factors ie  price earnings ratio  discount rate and residual capitalization rate were updated to reflect current market conditions 
the evaluation of goodwill in  and did not result in any goodwill amounts that were deemed impaired
