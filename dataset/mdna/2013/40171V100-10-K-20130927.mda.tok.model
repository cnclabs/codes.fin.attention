item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in item and the risk factors included in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
all information presented herein is based on our fiscal calendar 
unless otherwise stated  references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to our fiscal years ended in july and the associated quarters of those fiscal years 
we assume no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements for any reason  except as required by law 
overview we are a leading provider of core system software to the global p c insurance industry 
our solutions serve as the transactional systems of record for  and enable the key functions of  a p c insurance carrier s business underwriting and policy administration  claims management and billing 
since our inception  our mission has been to empower p c insurance carriers to transform and improve their businesses by replacing their legacy core systems with our software platform 
we derive our revenues from licensing our software applications  providing maintenance support and providing professional services to the extent requested by our customers 
our license revenues are primarily generated through annual license fees that recur during the term of our multi year contracts 
these multi year contracts have an average term of approximately five years and are renewed on an annual or multi year basis 
in certain cases  when required by a customer  we license our software on a perpetual license basis 
in addition  certain of our multi year term licenses provide the customer with the option to purchase a perpetual license at the end of the initial contract term 
we generally price our licenses based on the amount of direct written premiums dwp that will be managed by our solutions 
we typically invoice our customers annually in advance and quarterly in certain cases for both term license and maintenance fees  and we invoice our perpetual license customers either in full at contract signing or on an installment basis and invoice related maintenance fees annually  in advance 
to extend our technology leadership position in our market  we intend to continue to focus on product innovation through research and development and aggressively pursue new customers and up sell additional products within our existing customer base 
this will require us to make continued investment in our research and development and sales and marketing functions to capitalize on opportunities for growth 
we expect research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future to support this strategy 
research and development and sales and marketing expenses are also expected to increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods as we focus on expanding our technological leadership 
we face a number of risks in the execution of our strategy  including reliance on sales to a relatively small number of large customers  variances in the mix amongst our components of revenues  which could result in lower gross margin from services revenues as compared to license and maintenance revenues  and the overall impact of weakening economic conditions on the insurance industry 
we believe that our focus on continued product innovation and customer wins and renewals will support the expansion of our license sales and reduce the impact from weakened economic conditions 
we sell our core system software primarily through our direct sales force 
our sales cycle for new customers is typically to months 
product implementations  the primary driver of our services revenues  typically last to months and may take longer 
opportunities  challenges risks since august  our license revenues from new orders and subsequent annual and  in some cases  quarterly payments have generally been recognized when payment is due from our customers 
historically  and to a lesser extent during fiscal years  and  our license revenues from existing orders have been recognized under three methods under the residual method when payment is due and payable from our customers  under the percentage of completion method as we complete customer implementations of our software  or under the zero gross margin method as we complete customer implementations of our software 
our license revenues accounted for  and of our total revenues during the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
our maintenance revenues are generally recognized annually over the committed maintenance term 
our maintenance fees are typically priced as a fixed percentage of the associated license fees and generate lower gross margins than our license revenues 
our maintenance revenues accounted for  and of our total revenues during the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 

table of contents we generally charge services fees on a time and materials basis and revenues are typically recognized upon delivery of our services 
in certain offerings sold as fixed fee arrangements  we recognize services revenues on a proportional performance basis as performance obligations are completed by using the ratio of labor hours to date as an input measure compared to total estimated labor hours for the consulting services 
we derive our services revenues primarily from implementation services performed for our customers  revenues related to reimbursable travel expenses and training fees 
our services revenues generate lower gross margins than our license and maintenance revenues and accounted for  and of our total revenues during the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
we enter into multi year renewable contracts to license our software 
regardless of contract length  we typically invoice our customers for annual amounts at the beginning of the corresponding period 
our deferred revenues consist only of amounts that have been invoiced  but not yet recognized as revenues 
as a result  deferred revenues and change in deferred revenues are incomplete measures of the strength of our business and are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 
further  we expect to recognize our current deferred services revenue into income but do not expect significant deferrals of services revenue in future periods 
deferred license and service revenues related to projects under contract accounting as of july  were million and million  respectively  while deferred license and service revenues related to projects under contract accounting as of july  were million and million  respectively 
such deferral is in accordance with our revenue recognition policy as described under critical accounting policies and estimates 
we have historically experienced seasonal variations in our revenues as a result of increased customer orders in our second and fourth fiscal quarters and subsequent annual renewal fees 
we generally see increased orders in our second fiscal quarter  which is the quarter ended january  due to customer buying patterns 
we also see increased orders in our fourth fiscal quarter due to efforts by our sales team to achieve annual incentives 
as a result  a significantly higher percentage of our annual license fees are invoiced and recognized as revenues during those quarters at contract inception or in the subsequent quarter when the annual license payment is due and in subsequent years upon the anniversary of the contract date 
we generally expect these seasonal trends to continue in the future  which may cause quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations and certain financial metrics 
our quarterly growth in revenues may not match up to new orders we receive in a given quarter 
this mismatch is primarily due to the following reasons for the initial year of a multi year term license  we generally recognize revenues when payment is due and payment may not be due until a subsequent fiscal quarter  we may enter into license agreements with specified terms for product upgrades or functionality  which may require us to delay revenue recognition until the period in which the upgrade or functionality is delivered  and we may enter into license agreements with other contractual terms that may affect the timing of revenue recognition 
our revenue seasonality may fluctuate versus comparable prior periods or prior quarters within the same fiscal year based on when new orders are executed in the quarter and the payment terms of each order 
additionally  our revenue may fluctuate if our customers make an early payment of their annual fees 
our ability to renew existing contracts for multiple year terms versus annual automatic renewals may impact revenue recognition 
we generally charge annual software license fees for our multi year term licenses and price our licenses based on the amount of direct written premiums dwp that will be managed by our solutions 
however  in rare circumstances  our customers desire the ability to purchase our products on a perpetual license basis  resulting in an acceleration of revenue recognition 
milestone payments in a perpetual license order also cause seasonal variations 
our perpetual license revenues are not consistent from period to period 
in addition  a few of our multi year term licenses provide the customer with the option to purchase a perpetual license at the end of the initial contract term  which we refer to as a perpetual buyout right 
the mix of our contract terms for our licenses and the exercise of perpetual buyout rights at the end of the initial contract term by our customers may lead to variability in our results of operations 
increases in perpetual license sales and exercises of perpetual buyout rights by our customers may affect our ability to show consistent growth in license revenues in subsequent periods 
reductions in perpetual licenses in future periods could cause adverse period to period comparisons of our financial results 
in addition  because we price our products based on the amount of dwp that will be managed by our solutions  license revenues from each customer may fluctuate up or down based upon insurance policies sold by the customer in the preceding year 
if we enter into a new territory  our revenue recognition pattern may change depending on the contractual terms and local laws and regulations 
we generated revenues of million  million and million in the years ended july   and  respectively 
we generate the majority of our revenues in the united states and canada 
our revenues from outside the 
table of contents united states and canada as a percentage of total revenues were  and in the years ended july   and  respectively 
we generated net income of million  million and million in the years ended july   and  respectively 
no customer accounted for or more of our revenues for the years ended july   and our ten largest customers accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended july   and  respectively  and we expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time 
we count as customers distinct buying entities  which may include multiple national or regional subsidiaries of large  global p c insurance carriers 
key business metrics we use certain key metrics to evaluate and manage our business  including rolling four quarter recurring revenues from term licenses and total maintenance 
in addition  we present select gaap and non gaap financial metrics that we use internally to manage the business and that we believe are useful for investors 
these metrics include adjusted ebitda and operating cash flow 
four quarter recurring revenues we measure four quarter recurring revenues by adding the total term license revenues and total maintenance revenues recognized in the preceding four quarters ended in the stated period and excluding perpetual license revenues  revenues from perpetual buyout rights and services revenues 
this metric allows us to better understand the trends in our recurring revenues because it typically reduces the variations in any particular quarter caused by seasonality  the effects of the annual invoicing of our term licenses and certain effects of contractual provisions that may accelerate or delay revenue recognition in some cases 
our four quarter recurring revenues for each of the nine periods presented were four quarters ended july  april  january  october  july  april  january  october  july  in thousands term license revenues total maintenance revenues total four quarter recurring revenues adjusted ebitda we believe adjusted ebitda  a non gaap measure  is useful  in addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with gaap  in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry  as this metric generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance 
please refer to item  selected financial data  for further details on why we use this metric and why we believe this metric is useful to our stockholders 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda fiscal years ended july  unaudited  in thousands net income non gaap adjustments provision for benefit from income taxes other income expense  net interest income  net litigation provision depreciation and amortization stock based compensation adjusted ebitda 
table of contents operating cash flows we monitor our cash flows from operating activities  or operating cash flows  as a key measure of our overall business performance  which enables us to analyze our financial performance without the effects of certain non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expenses 
additionally  operating cash flows takes into account the impact of changes in deferred revenues  which reflects the receipt of cash payment for products before they are recognized as revenues 
our operating cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in deferred revenues  timing of bonus payments and collections of accounts receivable 
they were also impacted by the payment of a litigation settlement during the three months ended october  as a result  our operating cash flows fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
operating cash flows were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
for a further discussion of our operating cash flows  see liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures for contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable periods 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
our management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements to deliver multiple products or services multiple elements 
we apply software revenue recognition rules and allocate the total revenues among elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of each element 
we recognize revenue on a net basis excluding taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities 
revenues are derived from three sources i license fees  related to term or time based and perpetual software license revenue  ii maintenance fees  related to email and phone support  bug fixes and unspecified software updates and upgrades released when  and if available during the maintenance term  and iii services fees  related to professional services related to implementation of our software  reimbursable travel and training 
revenues are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
evidence of an arrangement consists of a written contract signed by both the customer and management prior to the end of the period 
delivery or performance has occurred 
our software is delivered electronically to the customer 
delivery is considered to have occurred when we provide the customer access to the software along with login credentials 
fees are fixed or determinable 
arrangements where a significant portion of the fee is due beyond days from delivery are not considered to be fixed or determinable 
revenues from such arrangements are recognized as payments become due  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
fees from term licenses are generally due in annual or  in certain cases  quarterly installments over the term of the agreement beginning on the effective date of the license 
accordingly  fees from term licenses are not considered to be fixed or determinable until they become due 
collectability is probable 
collectability is assessed on a customer by customer basis  based primarily on creditworthiness as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as customer payment history 
payment terms generally range from to days from invoice date 
if it is determined prior to revenue recognition that collection of an arrangement fee is not probable  revenues are deferred until collection becomes probable or cash is collected  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
vsoe of fair value does not exist for our software licenses  therefore  for all arrangements that do not include services that are essential to the functionality of the software  we allocate revenues to software licenses using the residual method 

table of contents under the residual method  the amount recognized for license fees is the difference between the total fixed and determinable fees and the vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements under the arrangement 
the vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those elements when sold separately 
vsoe of fair value for maintenance is established using the stated maintenance renewal rate in the customer s contract 
we generally enter into term licenses ranging from to years 
for term licenses with duration of one year or less  no vsoe of fair value for maintenance exists 
we began using stated maintenance renewal rates in customers contracts during fiscal year prior to that  customers contracts did not have stated maintenance renewal rates and we were unable to establish vsoe of maintenance 
vsoe of fair value for services is established if a substantial majority of historical stand alone selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow price range 
if vsoe of fair value for one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the total arrangement fee is not recognized until delivery of those elements occurs or when vsoe of fair value is established 
if the undelivered elements are all service elements and vsoe of fair value does not exist for one or more service element  the total arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the longest service period starting at software delivery  assuming all the related services have been made available to the customer 
when implementation services are sold with a license arrangement  we evaluate whether those services are essential to the functionality of the software 
prior to fiscal year  implementation services were determined to be essential to the software because the implementation services were generally not available from other third party vendors 
by the beginning of fiscal year  third party vendors were providing implementation services for claimcenter and it was concluded that implementation services generally were not essential to the functionality of the claimcenter software 
by the beginning of fiscal year  third party vendors were providing implementation services for policycenter and billingcenter and it was concluded that implementation services were generally no longer essential to the functionality of the policycenter and billingcenter software 
in certain offerings sold as fixed fee arrangements  we recognize services revenues on a proportional performance basis as performance obligations are completed by using the ratio of labor hours to date as an input measure compared to total estimated labor hours for the consulting services 
in cases where professional services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software  the arrangement is accounted for using contract accounting until the essential services are complete 
if reliable estimates of total project costs and the extent of progress toward completion can be made  we apply the percentage of completion method in recognizing the arrangement fee 
the percentage toward completion is measured by using the ratio of service billings to date compared to total estimated service billings for the consulting services 
service billings approximate labor hours as an input measure since they are billed monthly on a time and material basis 
for term licenses with license fees due in equal installments over the term  the license revenues subject to percentage of completion recognition includes only those payments that are due and payable within the reporting period 
the fees related to the maintenance are recognized over the period the maintenance is provided 
when vsoe for maintenance has not been established and the arrangement includes implementation services which are deemed essential to the functionality of the software and it is reasonably assured that no loss will be incurred under the arrangement  revenues are recognized pursuant to the zero gross margin method 
under this method  revenues recognized are limited to the costs incurred for the implementation services 
as a result  billed license and maintenance fees and the profit margin on the professional services are generally deferred until the essential services are completed and then recognized over the remaining term of the maintenance period 
if we cannot make reliable estimates of total project implementation and it is reasonably assured that no loss will be incurred under such arrangements  the zero profit margin method is applied whereby an amount of revenues equal to the incurred costs of the project is recognized as well as the incurred costs  producing a zero margin until project estimates become reliable 
the percentage of completion method is applied when project estimates become reliable  resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment for deferred license revenues to the extent of progress toward completion  and the related deferred professional service margin is recognized in full as revenues 
such cumulative effect adjustment for license revenues was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively  and for service revenues was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units rsus granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant  net of estimated forfeitures 
the rsus are subject to time based vesting  which generally occurs over a period of four years  and for those rsu awards granted prior to our ipo  a performance based condition  which was satisfied days after the completion of our ipo 
if an employee terminates employment from us prior to the occurrence of the performance based condition  the employee does not forfeit the rsus to the 
table of contents extent the time based vesting requirements were satisfied prior to termination 
the awards expire years from the grant date 
we estimate the grant date fair value  and the resulting stock based compensation expense  of our stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
the grant date fair value of the stock based awards is generally recognized using the accelerated multiple option approach over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards 
compensation cost for rsus is generally recognized over the time based vesting period regardless of the occurrence of the performance based condition noted above for awards granted prior to our ipo  since this condition was not subject to employment 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets related to excess tax benefits are recorded when utilized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount of which realization is more likely than not 
accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainties in income taxes provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income 
recent accounting pronouncement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit utb  or a portion of a utb  in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward  except as follows 
to the extent that a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use  and the entity does not intend to use  the deferred tax asset for such purpose  the utb should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets 
the guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented 
the data has been derived from the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k which  in the opinion of our management  reflect all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented 
the operating results for any period should not be considered indicative of results for any future period

in addition  there were million of additional revenues recognized when vsoe of fair value of maintenance was established for one customer during fiscal year these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million of revenues recognized due to completion of project implementations in prior periods  and a decrease of million of revenues recognized for one customer that exercised a perpetual buyout option in the prior period 
the million decrease in perpetual license revenues during fiscal year was primarily driven by new customers increasingly signing term license agreements in the current period

we have historically experienced seasonal variations in our revenues as a result of increased customer orders in our second and fourth fiscal quarters and subsequent annual fees and as a result of attainment of revenue recognition criteria related to orders from prior periods 
we generally see increased orders in our second fiscal quarter  which is the quarter ended january  due to customer buying patterns 
we also see increased orders in our fourth fiscal quarter due to efforts by our sales team to achieve annual incentives 
notwithstanding the fact that we generally see increased orders in our second and fourth fiscal quarters  we expect to see additional quarterly revenue fluctuations that may  in some cases  mask these expected seasonal variations 
our quarterly growth in revenues may not match up to new orders we receive in a given quarter 
this mismatch is primarily due to the following reasons for the initial year of a multi year term license  we generally recognize revenues when payment is due and payment may not be due until a subsequent fiscal quarter  we may enter into license agreements with specified terms for product upgrades or functionality  which may require us to delay revenue recognition for the initial period  and 
table of contents we may enter into license agreements with other contractual terms that may affect the timing of revenue recognition 
our revenue seasonality may fluctuate versus comparable prior periods or prior quarters within the same fiscal year based on when new orders are executed in the quarter and the payment terms of each order 
additionally  our revenue may fluctuate if our customers make an early payment of their annual fees 
our ability to renew existing contracts for multiple year terms versus annual automatic renewals may impact revenue recognition 
we generally charge annual software license fees for our multi year term licenses and price our licenses based on the amount of direct written premiums dwp that will be managed by our solutions 
however  in rare circumstances  our customers desire the ability to purchase our products on a perpetual license basis  resulting in an acceleration of revenue recognition 
milestone payments in a perpetual license order also cause seasonal variations 
our perpetual license revenues are not consistent from period to period 
in addition  a few of our multi year term licenses provide the customer with the option to purchase a perpetual license at the end of the initial contract term  which we refer to as a perpetual buyout right 
the mix of our contract terms for our licenses and the exercise of perpetual buyout rights at the end of the initial contract term by our customers may lead to variability in our results of operations 
increases in perpetual license sales and exercises of perpetual buyout rights by our customers may affect our ability to show consistent growth in license revenues in subsequent periods 
reductions in perpetual licenses in future periods could cause adverse period to period comparisons of our financial results 
in addition  because we price our products based on the amount of dwp that will be managed by our solutions  license revenues from each customer may fluctuate up or down based upon insurance policies sold by the customer in the preceding year 
if we enter into a new territory  our revenue recognition pattern may change  depending on the contractual terms and local laws and regulations 
our services revenues are also subject to seasonal fluctuations  though to a lesser degree than our license revenues 
our services revenues are impacted by the number of professional days in a given fiscal quarter 
the quarter ended january usually has fewer professional days due to the impact of the thanksgiving  christmas and new year s holidays 
because we pay our services professionals the same amounts throughout the year  our gross margins on our services revenues are lower in the quarter ended january our gross profit in absolute dollars varied from quarter to quarter in the quarters presented 
our cost to maintain our infrastructure is generally fixed within a given quarter 
therefore  when applied against our generally fixed costs  higher revenues in a quarter result in higher overall gross profits 
in most of the quarters presented  our operating expenses increased as a result of an increase in the number of total employees 
from july  to july   we have added additional employees in order to drive our sales efforts and increase our technical support  services  research and development and administrative personnel to support our growth 
research and development expenses in absolute dollars increased sequentially in every quarter presented 
increases were primarily a result of increasing headcount to maintain and improve the functionality of our software products 
research and development expenses varied as a percentage of revenues throughout the periods presented primarily due to the timing of revenues recognized but generally increased year over year as we continued to invest in our software development 
we expect to increase research and development expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues on an annual basis as we expect to increase our investment in our software development in our ongoing efforts to ensure we maintain our technology leadership position 
sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars varied from quarter to quarter in the quarters presented 
increases were primarily a result of increasing headcount in our direct sales teams  as well as increased marketing programs and events and timing of the programs 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues varied from quarter to quarter primarily due to the timing of revenues recognized  marketing programs and commissions earned and expensed  but generally stayed stable year over year as sales and marketing expenses grew along with our revenues 
general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars increased sequentially in every quarter presented except for the quarters ended april  and january  increases were primarily a result of increasing headcount to support the growth of our business 
general and administrative expenses varied as a percentage of revenues due to the timing of revenues recognized and the timing of professional service fees 
during the first three quarters of fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit primarily resulting from the reinstatement of federal research and development credits  the benefit from incentive stock option iso tax deductions  and permanent differences related to stock based compensation 

table of contents our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  making our results of operations variable and difficult to predict 
such factors include those discussed above and those set forth in risk factors we may experience quarterly and annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors and seasonal and other variations related to our revenue recognition may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
one or more of these factors may cause our results of operations to vary widely 
as such  we believe that our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future and that sequential quarterly comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million during the years ended july   and  respectively 
the year ended july  included the payment by us of a million litigation settlement payment 
we had capital expenditures of million  million and million for the years ended july   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures consisted of purchases of property and equipment  primarily consisting of computer hardware  software and leasehold improvements 
as of july   and  we had million  million and million of cash and cash equivalents  respectively  and working capital of million  million and million  respectively 
we experienced positive cash flows from operations during fiscal years  and our cash flows from operations are significantly impacted by timing of revenues  bonus payments and collections of accounts receivable  as well as by changes in deferred taxes 
we expect that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations on an annual basis  although this may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
in particular  we typically use more cash during the first fiscal quarter ended october  as we generally pay cash bonuses to our employees for the prior fiscal year during that period and pay seasonally higher sales commissions from increased orders in our fourth fiscal quarter 
as such  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenues growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and development efforts and expansion into other markets 
we may also seek to invest in  or acquire complementary businesses  applications or technologies 
to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
cash flows the following summary of cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k fiscal years ended july  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to net income that remained flat and a million increase in stock based compensation expenses  as well as a million litigation settlement payment in fiscal year which did not recur 
these increases were partially offset by increases in deferred tax assets in fiscal year  whereas deferred tax assets were being utilized in fiscal year additionally  excess tax benefits increased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to a million decrease in net income  which was partially offset by an increase of million in stock based compensation expenses 
fiscal year also included the release of a deferred tax valuation allowance  which did not recur in fiscal year  and large revenue deferrals 
fiscal year saw the release of significant deferred revenues due to the attainment of revenue recognition criteria 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of purchase and sales of short term and long term investments  capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment  and changes in our restricted cash 
in the future  we expect we will continue to invest in capital expenditures to support our expanding operations 
net cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to the investment of excess cash after our ipo 
net purchases of available for sale securities were million 
additionally  fiscal year included the acquisition of millbrook  inc for million  and an increase in capital expenditures driven by the final payments related to our headquarters move which were accrued as of july  net cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to the release of restricted cash during fiscal year compared to the receipt of restricted cash in fiscal year this was partially offset by increased capital expenditures related to our new headquarters 
cash flows from financing activities our financing activities consist primarily of cash receipts from the exercise of stock options  payments of taxes withheld from vesting of rsus and excess tax benefits realized on the exercise or release of each of these items 
in fiscal year  we received net inflows of cash from financing activities related to public offerings  which we do not expect to recur 
net cash from financing activities decreased from cash provided by financing activities to net cash used in financing activities 
this was primarily due to the receipt of million of proceeds from our ipo and follow on public offering in fiscal year  which was partially offset by million of costs paid in connection with these offerings 
in addition  fiscal year payments of taxes related to rsus vesting increased by million 
these decreases of cash were partially offset by million of increased proceeds from option exercises  and million of excess tax benefits recognized related to our stock based compensation transactions 
net cash from financing activities increased in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to our ipo and follow on public offerings of million  partially offset by the million of costs associated with the offerings 
additionally  proceeds from exercise of stock options increased by million  partially offset by million in taxes related to rsu vesting 
anticipated cash flows we expect to incur significant operating costs  particularly related to services delivery costs  sales and marketing  research and development  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that such operating costs  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on the level of future sales and our ability to manage infrastructure costs 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  should be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource requirements for at least the next twelve months 
after the next twelve months  we may find it necessary to obtain additional funds 
in the event additional funds are required  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of july  payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total in thousands operating lease obligations royalty obligations purchase commitments total operating lease agreements primarily represent our obligations to make payments under our non cancelable lease agreements for our corporate headquarters and offices through royalty obligations primarily represent our obligations under our non cancelable agreements related to certain revenue generating agreements 

table of contents purchase commitments consist of agreements to purchase services  entered into in the ordinary course of business 
these represent non cancelable commitments for which a penalty would be imposed if the agreement was canceled for any reason other than an event of default as described by the agreement 
as of july   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million associated with our us federal and california research and development tax credits 
we are unable to estimate when any cash settlement with a taxing authority might occur 
off balance sheet arrangements through july   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments as of july  and cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of july  our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments as of july  and were million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of cash  corporate bonds  agency debt securities  commercial paper  money market funds  and municipal debt securities with maturities of up to two years from the date of purchase as of july   and consisted primarily of cash  money market funds  and certificates of deposit with maturities of up to two years from the date of purchase as of july  our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the united states 
however  because of the short term nature of our interest bearing securities  a ten percent change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the canadian dollar  australian dollar  euro  british pound and japanese yen 
the volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy 
we believe our operating activities act as a natural hedge for a substantial portion of our foreign currency exposure because we typically collect revenues and incur costs in the currency in the location in which we provide our application 
although we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income loss as a result of transaction gains losses related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  we believe that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
to date  we have entered into one foreign currency hedging contract  but may consider entering into more such contracts in the future 
as our international operations grow  we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates
