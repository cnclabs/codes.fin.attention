overview tractor supply company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the united states and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle  as well as tradesmen and small businesses 
as of december   we operated  retail stores in states under the names tractor supply company and del s feed farm supply 
we also operate a website under the name tractorsupply 
com 
our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities  and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise equine  livestock  pet and small animal products  including items necessary for their health  care  growth and containment  hardware  truck  towing and tool products  seasonal products  including lawn and garden items  power equipment  gifts and toys  maintenance products for agricultural and rural use  and work recreational clothing and footwear 
our current and long term growth strategy is to expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores  enhance financial performance through same store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value price philosophy and supported by strong customer service  enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation  a strong exclusive brand offering  and optimization of product pricing  transportation and distribution costs  leverage operating costs  especially advertising  distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes  expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers online experience and expand through selective acquisition  as such opportunities arise  to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth 
over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores  growing from stores at the end of to  stores at the end of fiscal  and in sales  with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 
given the size of the communities that we target  we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets 
we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over additional markets for new tractor supply stores 
executive summary we opened new stores in and new stores in  a selling square footage increase of approximately and  respectively 
during  we opened our first stores in colorado  and in  we expect to continue our expansion into new markets  including arizona 
we achieved strong performance in fiscal  delivering diluted earnings per share of versus in fiscal as stated in the prior year  we estimate that the rd week in fiscal represented a benefit of approximately per diluted share 
net sales increased to billion in  or over the prior year week period adjusted for the extra sales week in fiscal as part of the company week calendar 
same store sales increased  driven primarily by continued strong results in key consumable  usable and edible cue products  principally animal and pet related merchandise 
as a percent of sales  gross margin improved to from in the prior year 
our gross margin rate continues to benefit from key margin driving initiatives  including strategic sourcing  inventory and markdown management and price optimization 
we ended the year with million in cash and restricted cash  after returning nearly million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends 

index significant accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our financial position and or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory valuation inventory impairment we identify potentially excess and slow moving inventory by evaluating turn rates  historical and expected future sales trends  age of merchandise  overall inventory levels  current cost of inventory and other benchmarks 
the estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value ie  an inability to realize the full carrying value is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies 
we do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term 
however  changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves 
our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment 
however  if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our impairment reserve at december   would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal 
index description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions shrinkage we perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year  and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts 
the reserve is established by assessing the chain wide average shrinkage experience rate  applied to the related periods sales volumes 
such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences 
the estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience 
we believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends 
our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends  the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve 
however  if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our shrinkage reserve at december   would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal vendor funding we receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors  in support of our business initiatives  through a variety of programs and arrangements  including guaranteed vendor support funds vendor support and volume based rebate funds volume rebates 
the amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements  most of which are evergreen  reflecting the on going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors 
certain of our agreements  primarily volume rebates  are renegotiated annually  based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product 
vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold 
during interim periods  the amount of vendor support is known and is debited to vendors systematically  however  volume rebates are estimated during interim periods based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors 
the estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding through volume rebates is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels  sales trends and expected customer demand  as well as planned new store openings and relocations 
although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods  it is possible that actual year end results could differ from previously estimated amounts 
our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand  purchasing activity  target thresholds  vendor attrition and collectibility 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented 
at the end of each fiscal year  a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known 
thus  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support 
we do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal if a reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of december   net income would have been affected by approximately million 
although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support  if such a reduction were to occur in future periods  the company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales 
freight we incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution 
such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories on an aggregate basis and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold 
we allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories 
this assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented 
if a increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance as of december   net income would have been affected by approximately million in fiscal 
index description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions self insurance reserves we self insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance  workers compensation and general liability insurance plans 
we have stop loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values 
when estimating our self insured liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  demographic factors and severity factors 
the full extent of certain claims  especially workers compensation and general liability claims  may not become fully determined for several years 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insurance reserves in the financial periods presented 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves 
however  if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
a change in our self insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal sales tax audit reserve a portion of our sales are to tax exempt customers  predominantly agricultural based 
we obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt transaction 
many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws 
the business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment 
these circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance 
while we believe we appropriately enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations  there can be no assurance that we  upon final completion of such audits  would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions 
we review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non compliance 
any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state 
we continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results  changes in policies  preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors  and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment 
our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural based exemptions  the ambiguity in state tax regulations  the number of ongoing audits  and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities 
we have not made any material changes to our sales tax audit assessment methodology in the financial periods presented 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve 
however  if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in our sales tax audit reserve at december   would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal 
index description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions tax contingencies our income tax returns are periodically audited by us federal and state tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a change in our uncertain tax position reserve at december  would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal 
index description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions impairment of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
the evaluation for long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows  which is generally the individual store level 
the significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations  including margin on net sales  payroll and related items  occupancy costs  insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
none of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive  and a change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to losses that could be material
