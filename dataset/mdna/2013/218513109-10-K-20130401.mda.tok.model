item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations of cordia and its majority owned subsidiary  bank of virginia bova 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with cordia s financial statements and related notes thereto located elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion pertains to our historical results  which includes the operations of bova subsequent to the purchase of a majority interest in such entity on december  general cordia was incorporated in its founders were former bank ceos  directors and advisors seeking to invest in undervalued or troubled community banks in the mid atlantic and southeast 
aside from the shares of bova common stock  cordia s only other asset totaled thousand at december   consisting primarily of cash 
as of december   cordia held approximately of the outstanding shares of bova common stock 
bova is a state chartered bank headquartered in midlothian  virginia with total assets of approximately million at december  bova provides retail banking services to individuals and commercial customers through three banking locations in chesterfield county  virginia and one in henrico county  virginia 
executive overview we spent much of and condensing the balance sheet as we worked through asset quality issues  recruited new staff  and reorganized our lending and deposit activities while addressing the requirements of bova s written agreement 
interest income was down primarily from lower asset volume 
interest expense decreased as a result of aggressive deposit repricing as well as a lower volume of certificates of deposits 
noninterest expense decreased through management action to minimize controllable expenses and a restructure of management personnel 
during  bova hired a new credit management team which included a chief credit officer  a chief operating officer who also serves as bova s senior lending officer  and a senior vice president responsible for working out problem loans and seeking recoveries 
in  the new credit management team dedicated a large portion of its time to portfolio management  including establishing new credit underwriting disciplines  training staff  resolving problem assets  as well as performing a detailed assessment of the accuracy of credit risk grades and bova s allowance for loan losses 
moreover  bova engaged a third party loan review firm to review the accuracy of this completed work 
during  bova continued to deploy its new credit disciplines as resolutions of problem assets and new loan originations accelerated 
in addition  bova hired three business development officers who specialize in commercial lending and have brought portions of their portfolios to the bank  as well as originating high quality loans through new customer contacts 
these officers are also stressing the value of a total relationship and are instrumental in bringing accompanying deposit relationships 
bova is also partnering with other business entities to participate in loan programs which would bring increased loan production to the bank without a compromise of asset quality or capital risk 
management has continued to price deposits conservatively  particularly time deposits  in order to control margin erosion and has been successful in increasing deposits  primarily in transaction and savings  while reducing the cost of funds 
during the first quarter of  the company substantially increased its lending and funding activities 
bank of virginia s residential mortgage program  involving participations in held for sale loans originated by stonegate mortgage corporation and packaged primarily for sale to government sponsored enterprises such as ginnie mae and fannie mae  was increased from million to million 
the bank also launched a new initiative partnering with gradcapital  llc to purchase rehabilitated student loans backed by the government s guarantee and serviced by xerox education services 
approximately million of such loans were purchased during the quarter 
the bank also significantly expanded its deposit base  primarily involving institutional money market and certificate of deposit accounts  at average rates lower than the bank s prevailing retail rates 
results of operations net income there was a consolidated net loss of thousand for the year ended december  compared to a net consolidated loss of million for the year ended december  net interest income before the provision for loan losses declined or million from million for to million for the major factor contributing to the decrease in net interest income in was a decrease in average interest earning assets and a significant increase in average interest bearing deposit liability accounts 
net interest income net interest income is the largest component of our income  and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
our interest earning assets include loans  investment securities  interest bearing deposits in other banks  and federal funds sold 
our interest bearing liabilities include deposits and advances from the fhlb 
net interest income declined million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest income declined million from million during to million for a decrease of million in the average balance of loans held for investment combined with a basis point decrease in the average yield drove the decrease in interest income 
this decrease was the result of the continued low interest rate environment and reduced amortization of the fair value discount on the loan portfolio during compared to also contributing to the reduction in interest income was a reduction in the securities available for sale portfolio and a corresponding million increase in lower yielding average interest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  this reduction of thousand was due to lower interest expense on deposits as a result of a concerted effort to allow higher priced time deposits to roll off as they matured as well as promotion of transaction and savings accounts 
interest expense on fhlb borrowings was thousand for  compared to thousand for the decline in fhlb interest expense was primarily the result of reduced fhlb borrowings 
average balances and yields the following tables present information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities  the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest earning assets  the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  and the resulting yields and costs 
the yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented

this model calculated the historical loss component by utilizing a ratio of losses to total loans in a given quarter 
this loss ratio was then applied to all loans rated special mention or better and used as a predictor of future losses 
this methodology did not take into account the portfolio composition or the losses attributed to each component of the mix 
current management analyzed net charge offs for the previous twelve quarters ending december  using the call report loan types and then weighted the quarters  weighting more recent quarters more heavily 
the weighting ratios were the same as used in the old model 
current management also engaged an independent firm to conduct a loan review to ascertain overall asset quality in the loan portfolio and to evaluate potential losses by segment 
in addition  management reviewed the types of loans it is originating compared to the legacy portfolio 
in the commercial portfolio  the bank is concentrating on business loans secured by various types of owner occupied real estate and other business assets 
it is not actively pursuing acquisition and development or construction loans 
in the retail portfolio  emphasis is placed on well collateralized loans to stable consumers 
as illustrated in the financial presentations  problem loans as a percentage of the portfolio continue to decrease 
as a result of these measures  management determined that the level of both general reserves and specific reserves associated with impaired loans could be reduced in since its initial analysis in  management has continued to enhance the alll process with the identification and use of additional metrics  including identification of outstanding balances for all new loans made since june  to evaluate them separately from the legacy loans  identification of all renewed legacy loans since june  risk rated or better  enhance granularity in the calculation 
more detailed analysis of required specific reserves  including projections of charge offs and recoveries 
these metrics have enabled the bank to more closely project the needed alll and thus determine the level of provision to be made on a regular basis 
management presented the methodology change to its external audit firm which agreed that bova s methodology change was appropriate 
the acquisition accounting used at the date of cordia s investment december  analyzed the loan portfolio using the same segments as the revised allowance model at bova and established anticipated credit marks based on each individual segment  therefore a change in methodology was not required on a consolidated basis 
new loans originated after december  follow the bova revised allowance methodology 
residential loans held for sale are not included in the alll calculations by virtue of their high credit quality and short holding period 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
improving credit underwriting  recoveries of loans previously charged off  and effective management of lower quality loans combined with a lower volume of nonperforming assets has lowered the risk in the loan portfolio 
as a result  provision expense was thousand during  compared to million during this amount reflected our emphasis on early detection of problem loans  accurate assessment of the extent of losses  and aggressive management of those loans through restructures  refinancing with other institutions  or other means of mitigating potential losses 
to lead our management of problem loans  we hired a highly skilled and seasoned chief credit officer and senior vice president of special assets during the second quarter of the allowance for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december  an analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses is presented under the caption allowance for loan losses

non interest income noninterest income for the year ended december  was thousand  compared to thousand for the year ended december  the improvement was primarily the result of a decreased net loss on the sale of available for sale securities from thousand in to thousand in nsf fees declined thousand from thousand for to thousand for as a result of lower volumes of overdrafts and the impact of regulation e on the ability to charge for overdrafts caused by use of debit cards

between december and december  bova hired a senior vice president of retail banking  three commercial business development officers  an additional loan operations employee and a loan workout manager 
as a result  salary and employee benefits increased thousand to million for the year ended december  when compared to million for the year ended december  significant expense reductions were realized from fdic insurance assessment  a gain on the sale of oreo  legal and professional fees and occupancy expense

due to the change in control of bova in december  the amount of the loss carryforward available to offset taxable income is limited to approximately thousand per year for twenty years 
financial condition loans loans represent the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
loans carry inherent credit and liquidity risks associated with the creditworthiness of our borrowers and general economic conditions at december   total loans net of reserves were million versus million at december  the following table sets forth the composition of the loan portfolio by category at the dates indicated and highlights our general emphasis on commercial and commercial real estate lending

at december   commercial real estate loans totaled million or of the total portfolio  of which  acquisition  development and construction loans were million 
the second largest component  commercial and industrial loans  totaled million and represented of the total loan portfolio 
consumer loans  which were comprised principally of residential mortgage and home equity loans  totaled million  or of the portfolio 
at december   single family residential mortgage loans totaled million while home equity lines totaled million 
residential real estate loans consisted of first and second mortgages on single or multi family residential dwellings 
our loan portfolio also includes consumer lines of credit and installment loans 
at december   those consumer loans totaled thousand and represented of the total loan portfolio 
we do not engage in foreign lending  credit card lending or lease financing 
the repayment of maturing loans in the loan portfolio is also a source of liquidity for cordia 
the following tables set forth our loans maturing within specified intervals after the dates indicated 
these tables were prepared based on the contractually outstanding balance and the contractual maturity date 
these balances differ from the general ledger balances because of certain purchase accounting adjustments 
loan maturity schedule december  dollars in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total commercial real estate acquisition  development and construction   commercial     commercial and industrial    consumer     loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates  floating interest rates  the information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their maturities 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval as well as modification of terms 
consequently  we believe the treatment in the above table presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio as shown in the above table 
residential mortgage loans held for sale have stated maturities generally of to years  but typically are held days and in any event no longer than days without a waiver in the bank s sole discretion 
allowance for loan losses at december   our allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding and of non performing loans 
at december   our allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans and of non performing loans 
in the currently weak economic environment  levels of non performing assets remain at elevated levels 
these trends along with management evaluation of the loan portfolio have led to the requirement for a higher allowance for loan losses than historical levels 
however  these reserve levels have been gradually declining since late due to the success of the bank s workout and recovery efforts as well as improvement in the overall quality of the bank s loan portfolio 
management has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of the loan portfolio  the timely identification of potential problem credits and impaired loans and the establishment of an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
the acquired loan portfolio was originally recorded at fair value  which includes a credit mark to market  based on the acquisition method of accounting 
loans renewed performing loans acquired or originated since the date of our initial investment are evaluated and an appropriate allowance for loan losses is established 
any worsening of acquired impaired loans since the date of the cordia s investment in bova is evaluated for further impairment 
additional impairment on acquired impaired loans is recorded through the provision for loan losses 
any improvement in cash flows of acquired impaired loans is amortized as a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loans 
a fuller explanation may be found in the table under the caption loans with deteriorated credit quality regarding accretable and nonaccretable discount 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan is confirmed  which decreases the balance of the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited back to the allowance 
the allowance consists of a specific component allocated to impaired loans and a general component allocated to the aggregate of all unimpaired loans 
the amount of the allowance is established through the application of a standardized model  the components of which are an impairment analysis of identified loans to determine the level of any specific reserves needed on impaired loans  and a broad analysis of historical loss experience  economic factors and portfolio related environmental factors to determine the level of general reserves needed 
the model inputs include an evaluation of historical charge offs  the current trends in delinquencies  and adverse credit migration and trends in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  including concentrations in higher risk loan types 
consideration is also given to the results of regulatory examinations 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the specific borrowers ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the use of various estimates and judgments in our ongoing evaluation of the required level of allowance can significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition and may result in either greater provisions to increase the allowance or reduced provisions based upon management s current view of portfolio and economic conditions and the application of revised estimates and assumptions 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as substandard or worse 
for such loans that are also classified as impaired  a specific allowance is established 
the general component covers loans graded special mention or better and is based on an analysis of historical loss experience  national and local economic factors  and environmental factors specific to the loan portfolio composition 
changes affecting the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table 
the following table represents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated 
notwithstanding these allocations  the entire allowance is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category

this compares to million at december  special mention loans decreased million from million at december  to million at december  and loans graded pass increased million from million at december  to million at december   as loan balances in these two categories migrated to other credit quality classes 
loans acquired by cordia in december with deteriorating credit quality have declined million from million at december  to million at december  during  we hired a new credit management team which included a chief credit officer  a chief operating officer promoted in to president of bova who also serves as the bank s senior lending officer  and a senior vice president responsible for working out problem loans and seeking recoveries 
the new credit management team dedicated a large portion of its time in to portfolio management  including new credit underwriting disciplines  training staff  resolving problem assets  as well as performing a detailed assessment of the accuracy of credit risk grades and assuring the bank is appropriately reserved 
moreover  we engaged a third party loan review firm to review the accuracy of this completed work 
at december   we believe that credit risk grades are accurate and the reserves established subsequent to our investment in bova are at appropriate levels 
the bank has continued to employ its third party loan review firm  thurmond clower associates  for annual reviews and periodic special assignments 
the most recent review was completed in april the scope of the loan file review totaled approximately of the bank s exposure and included the following all classified loans or total relationship exposures over  all other loans or total relationship exposures over  a random sample of pass rated loans determined by the loan review firm under  all loans past due as of the review date  all loans of  or more rated watch or higher as of the date of the review  all oreo properties  all insider loans  including loans to directors  significant shareholders  and executive management granted since the last review  any loans that management or the board of directors requested be reviewed  annually review of the allowance for loan and lease loss reserve and methodology  and annually review of all adversely graded loans in excess of  nonperforming assets the past due status of a loan is based on the contractual due date of the most delinquent payment due 
loans  including impaired loans  are generally classified as nonaccrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans greater than days past due may remain on an accrual status if management determines it has adequate collateral and cash flow to cover the principal and interest or is in the process of refinancing 
if a loan or a portion of a loan that is delinquent more than days is adversely classified  or is partially charged off  the loan is generally classified as nonaccrual 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the full collectability of principal and interest of a loan  it is placed on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed  and the amortization of related deferred loan fees or costs is suspended 
while a loan is classified as nonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful  collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding 
when the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is expected  interest income may be recognized on a cash basis 
in the case where a nonaccrual loan has been partially charged off  recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate 
cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge offs have been fully recovered 
loans placed on non accrual status may be returned to accrual status after payments are received for a minimum of six consecutive months in accordance with the loan documents  and any doubt as to the loan full collectability has been removed  or the loan is restructured and supported by a well documented credit evaluation of the borrower financial condition and the prospects for full payment 
when a loan is returned to accrual status after restructuring the risk rating remains unchanged until a satisfactory payment history is re established typically for at least six months 
nonperforming assets totaled million  or of total assets at december  and are comprised of non accrual loans of million  accruing troubled debt restructures tdr s of million and repossessed collateral of million 
the balance of nonperforming assets at december  was million or of total assets 
the decrease at december  from december  was a result of management s aggressive approach to workout and resolution of problem loans 
real estate acquired through  or in lieu of  foreclosure is held for sale and is stated at the estimated fair market value of the property  less estimated disposal costs 
any excess of the principal over the estimated fair market value at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
the estimated fair market value is reviewed periodically by management and any write downs are charged against current earnings 
development and improvement costs relating to property are capitalized unless such added costs cause the properties recorded value to exceed the estimated fair market value 
net operating income or expenses of such properties are included in collection  repossession and other real estate owned expenses 
a summary of nonperforming assets  including troubled debt restructurings  as of the dates indicated follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans    accruing troubled debt restructurings commercial real estate non owner occupied   commercial and industrial total accruing tdrs   real estate owned   total nonperforming assets    nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings non owner occupied commercial real estate residential mortgages total nonaccrual loans to total loans total nonaccrual loans to total assets total nonperforming assets to total assets total loans    total assets   loans with deteriorated credit quality in the acquisition of bova certain loans were acquired which showed evidence of deterioration in credit quality 
these loans are accounted for under the guidance of asc information related to these loans as of the dates indicated is provided in the following table

sales of available for sale securities were million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  during and  we liquidated our position in certain us government agency and municipal securities while increasing the balance and shortening the maturities of our agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
this strategy reduced our portfolio yield while also reducing our interest rate and liquidity risk 
we take into account the risk weighting category of a security so as to minimize any adverse effect it may have on bova s risk weighted capital ratio 
as of december   we had unrealized losses of thousand on four of our agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities with an aggregate fair value of million 
all of the unrealized losses are attributable to increases in interest rates and not to credit deterioration 
currently  we do not believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the investments 
because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not to credit quality and because it is not likely we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the following tables set forth the scheduled maturities and average yields of securities available for sale at december  within one year after one year within five years after five years within ten years after ten years total dollars in thousands amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield us government agencies agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities total   deposits and other interest bearing liabilities at december   total deposits were million  compared to million at december  core deposits  which by fdic guidelines exclude certificates of deposit of  or more  are derived predominantly from the local retail and commercial market and provide a relatively stable funding source for our loan portfolio and other earning assets 
our core deposits were million at december   or of total deposits  compared to million at december   or of total deposits 
deposits  and particularly core deposits  have been the primary source of funding and have enabled us to successfully meet both our short term and long term liquidity needs 
we anticipate that such deposits will continue to be our primary source of funding in the future 
our loan to deposit ratio was at december  and at december  the following table sets forth our deposits by category at the dates indicated 
at december  dollars in thousands amount percent amount percent amount percent noninterest bearing demand accounts   now accounts    savings and money market accounts   time deposits less than    time deposits  or more   total    at december   of our time deposits over  had maturities within twelve months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be more sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes in comparison to core deposits 
as a result of measured efforts to reduce dependency on these non core deposits  transaction and savings account products with attractive rates and features were promoted  thus increasing those balances as a percentage of total deposits from at december  to at december  even with gradual rate reductions in these categories  balances are increasing 
the maturity distribution of our time deposits of  or more and other time deposits at december   is set forth in the following table december  dollars in thousands time deposits of k and greater time deposits of less than k total months to maturity three months or less    over three to twelve months    one to three years    over three years    total    at december   of time deposits mature in the three to twelve months time frame 
this is indicative of customers reluctance to extend maturities in the current economy 
management monitors maturity trends in time deposits as part of its overall asset liability management strategy 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity liquidity management involves monitoring our sources and uses of funds in order to meet our short term and long term cash flow requirements while optimizing profits 
liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations  including through the sale of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through short term borrowings 
bova s primary access to liquidity comes from several sources operating cash flows from payments received on loans and mortgage backed securities  increased deposits  and cash reserves 
bova s secondary sources of liquidity are federal funds sold  unpledged securities available for sale  and borrowings from correspondent banks  the fhlb and the federal reserve bank s discount window 
liquidity strategies are implemented and monitored by the asset liability committee alco of our bova board of directors 
bova s deposit base grew by from million at december  to million at december  in a concerted effort to reduce its funding costs bova allowed high cost time deposits to roll out of the bank during and the first half of and concentrated on generation of more reasonably price core deposit growth 
in the second half of  bova gradually increased its retail deposit base in anticipation of funding a million residential mortgage held for sale loan program that commenced in december core deposits at december  were of total deposits compared to at december  as it looks to implement other loan growth initiatives for  bova has developed several funding strategies  including judicious use of brokered and institutional deposits  to augment core deposit growth and further reduce the cost of funds 
development of several sources of funding beyond core deposit growth ensures maximum liquidity access without dependence on higher cost sources of funds 
bova maintains an investment portfolio of available for sale marketable securities that may be used for liquidity purposes by either pledging them through repo transactions against borrowings from the fhlb or a correspondent bank or by selling them on the open market 
those securities consist primarily of us government agency debt securities 
to the extent any securities are pledged against borrowing from one credit facility  the borrowing ability of other secured borrowing facilities would be reduced by a like amount 
borrowings throughout and as of december   bova had a million committed repo line with a correspondent bank through which borrowings could be made against the pledge of marketable securities subject to mark to market valuations and standard collateral borrowing ratios 
this line was unused during and and remains fully available 
bova also maintains a million secured line of credit as well as a million unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks that were available for direct borrowings or federal funds purchased 
bova is a member of the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb  which provides access to additional lines of credit and other products offered by the fhlb 
these borrowings are largely secured by bova s loan portfolio 
the fhlb maintains a blanket security agreement on qualifying collateral 
as of december   bova had million in secured borrowings outstanding with the fhlb atlanta against pledged eligible mortgage loan collateral  at a stated interest rate of 
there were million in fhlb advances as of december  as of december   bova had a total credit availability of million at the fhlb which could be accessed through pledging a combination of eligible mortgage loan collateral and investment securities 
the fhlb offers a variety of floating and fixed rate loans at terms ranging from overnight to years  therefore  bova can match borrowings mitigating interest rate risk 
bova is also a member in good standing of the federal reserve bank system and has approved access to the federal reserve bank discount window where it can borrow short term funds against the pledge of loans and securities 
liquidity contingency plan historically bova has maintained both a retail branch based and an asset based liquidity strategy and has not depended materially on brokered deposits or utilized securitization as sources of liquidity 
bova strives to follow regulatory guidance in the management of liquidity risk and has established a board approved contingency funding plan cfp that prescribes liquidity risk limits and guidelines and includes pro forma cash flow analyses of bova s sources and uses of funds under various liquidity scenarios 
bova s cfp includes funding alternatives that can be implemented if access to normal funding sources is reduced 
we are not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our short term or long term liquidity 
based on the current and expected liquidity needs  including any liquidity needs associated with loan growth or generated by off balance sheet transactions such as commitments to extend credit  commitments to purchase securities and standby letters of credit  we expect to be able to meet our obligations for the next twelve months 
capital bova is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on our financial statements 
under the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines bova must meet specific capital guidelines that are based on quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require financial institutions to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined 
at december   bova met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject 
bova is also required to maintain capital at a minimum level as a proportion of quarterly average assets  which is known as the leverage ratio 
the minimum levels to be considered well capitalized are for tier leverage ratio  for tier risk based capital ratio  and for total risk based capital ratio

interest rate sensitivity the pricing and maturity of assets and liabilities are monitored and managed in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in rates could have on net interest income 
the principal monitoring techniques employed by us are the economic value of equity eve and net interest income or earnings at risk nii or ear and the repricing gap 
eve and nii are cash flow and earnings simulation modeling techniques which predict likely economic outcomes given various interest rate scenarios 
the repricing gap is the positive or negative dollar difference between the balance of assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by closely matching the interest rate repricing periods of assets or liabilities at the time they are acquired and by adjusting that match as the balance sheet grows or the mix of asset and liability characteristics or interest rates change 
that adjustment can be accomplished by selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity with those of different characteristics  or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of different assets and liabilities that reprice in a given time interval may help to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
at december   bova s cumulative gap to assets was compared to at december  this change is a direct reflection of strategic realignment of the securities portfolio  continued shift toward variable rate loans  and the rolldown of higher priced time deposits 
continued management of the balance sheet and its interest sensitive components has resulted in a positive cumulative gap throughout all repricing periods with the exception of the overnight period  which is due to the immediately repriceable nature of checking  savings  and money market accounts 
application of a basis point rate increase to the margin resulted in a thousand improvement to the margin or a change 
application of a basis point rate increase resulted in a appreciation in equity compared to a appreciation at december   whereas a decrease of basis points results in an depreciation in equity  compared to a depreciation in equity at december  off balance sheet risk commitments and contingencies through our operations  we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities 
these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time 
at december   we had issued commitments to extend credit of million through various types of commercial lending arrangements 
the majority of these commitments to extend credit had variable rates 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness for such commitments on a case by case basis in the same manner as for the approval of a direct loan 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit  is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  commercial and residential real estate 
contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the following table 
payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years time deposits     operating lease obligations  total     critical accounting policies cordia s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
cordia s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our financial position and or results of operations 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary principally when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded based upon the probability of occurrence of a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are either based on quoted market prices or provided by third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal or third party modeling techniques and or appraisal estimates 
cordia s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis 
the following is a summary of cordia s critical accounting policies 
in addition  the disclosures presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in this section provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
business combinations cordia accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting  a cost allocation process which requires the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the acquisition method of accounting requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date 
to determine the fair values  cordia relies on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
acquired loans with specific credit related deterioration 
acquired loans with specific credit deterioration are accounted for by cordia in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification certain acquired loans  those for which specific credit related deterioration  since origination  is identified  are recorded at fair value reflecting the present value of the amounts expected to be collected 
income recognition on these loans is based on a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected 
acquired loans deemed impaired and considered collateral dependent  with the timing of the sale of loan collateral indeterminate  remain on non accrual status and have no accretable yield 
allowance for loan losses we monitor and maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we maintain policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
we evaluate loans graded substandard or worse individually for impairment 
these evaluations are based upon expected discounted cash flows or collateral values 
if the evaluation shows that the loan s expected discounted cash flows or underlying collateral is not sufficient to repay the loan as agreed in accordance with the terms of the loan  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment  which represents the difference between the principal amount of the loan less the expected discounted cash flows or value of the underlying collateral  net of selling costs 
for loans without individual measures of impairment which are loans graded special mention or better  we make estimates of losses for pools of loans grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan as well as the assigned loan classification 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade and the predominant collateral type for the group 
the resulting estimate of losses for pools of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and pools of loans is added together for a total estimate of loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to our allowance for loan losses as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made through a charge to the income statement 
if the estimate of losses is less than the existing allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses is below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance is reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
we recognize the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is materially overstated 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made in future periods 
these additional provisions may be material to the financial statements 
impact of inflation since the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as bova are primarily monetary in nature  interest rates have a more significant effect on bova s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices of goods and services 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  we seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
