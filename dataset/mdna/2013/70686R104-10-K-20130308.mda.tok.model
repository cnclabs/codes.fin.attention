special note regarding forward looking statements with the exception of historical facts  the statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis are forward looking statements 
all of these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the relevant forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a

overview we are an intellectual property ip investment  advisory and asset management firm 
we develop and implement strategies to create  acquire  and commercialize intellectual property assets 
we focus on opportunities to invest in what we believe are undervalued or underutilized ip assets  and to make these assets available to prospective licensees on what we believe are fair  reasonable  and predictable terms 
our transactional expertise  financial resources  industry relationships and tax assets provide us with key competitive advantages that enable us to explore and pursue these opportunities 
our team of experienced professionals  including engineers and lawyers  is critical to our ability to identify and pursue investment opportunities and to create value from our assets 
our team includes six holders of phds  fourteen engineers with electrical or mechanical engineering degrees  and eleven recipients of juris doctor degrees 
a number of the members of our team are identified as inventors of issued patents  and six have been recognized as global leaders in the intellectual property asset management industry 
most of our employees have significant prior experience in communications and technology companies including at t  clearwire  intel  microsoft  qualcomm  xerox  and yahoo 
our patent portfolio has grown to include more than  issued us and foreign patents  covering digital rights management  wireless handset and infrastructure technologies  e commerce  mobile applications  video delivery  security and other technologies 
the vast majority of the inventions described in our patents were conceived either by our employees  or by global innovation leaders such as ibm  philips and xerox 
many of the 
table of contents inventions in our portfolio are incorporated into various standards  such as oma  mpeg  wifi  bluetooth  lte  cdma  umts and others 
our licensing efforts continue to expand  both through new engagements with prospective licensees in connection with our mobility licensing program  as well as through the development of new licensing programs aimed at making our ip available to new segments and products for which we believe our ip is applicable 
our licensing arrangements typically involve the payment of an upfront license fee representing all or a majority of the licensing revenues that will be paid in exchange for a nonexclusive  nontransferable  limited duration license to use specified ip for specified products and or specified purposes 
while contentguard s drm technologies have historically been licensing for handsets primarily  our most recent license agreements have been expanded to cover tablets as well 
the duration of licensing negotiations typically ranges from months from the inception of discussions 
in the event that licensing negotiations cannot be successfully concluded on what we believe are fair and reasonable terms within that period  we may decide to initiate litigation in order to protect the value of our ip 
consequently  the amount and timing of our revenue will likely continue to be uneven from quarter to quarter 
we provide ip advisory services through our wholly owned subsidiary  ovidian  which we acquired in june through ovidian  we advise some of the most respected technology companies in the world on a variety of ip related advisory services  including ip valuation and investment analysis  ip landscape analysis  ip acquisitions and divestitures  and ip risk mitigation strategies 
the ovidian team is also actively engaged in the investigation and analysis of ip investment opportunities on our behalf  as well as the development and implementation of many aspects of our ip business strategies 
the amount of consulting revenues generated by ovidian varies quarter to quarter based on the nature and structure of fee agreements with clients as well as the amount of time the ovidian team dedicates to supporting internal acquisition  licensing and sale efforts 
finally  we have addressed all remaining vestiges of our legacy satellite communication business 
we sold dbsd to dish network  we settled our litigation with boeing  we sold our residual satellite assets  and we wound down or divested most of our satellite communication subsidiaries 
our exit from the satellite business has generated approximately billion in nols which  subject to internal revenue code loss recognition provisions  we believe can be carried forward to offset taxable income for up to years 
we adopted a tax benefit preservation plan in designed to preserve the value of the nols for pendrell and our shareholders 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies require difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include significant estimates and assumptions made by us using information available at the time the estimates are made 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies involve judgments associated with our accounting for business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets  contract settlements  revenue recognition  stock based compensation  income taxes and contingencies  each of which is described below 
business combinations 
we account for business combinations using the acquisition method and  accordingly  the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to estimates about future expected cash flows from customers  proprietary technology  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position and discount rates 
our estimates are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including the amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
subsequent changes to assets  liabilities  valuation allowance or uncertain tax positions that relate to the acquired company and existed at the acquisition date that occur both within the measurement period and as a result of new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are 
table of contents recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
acquisition related costs  including advisory  legal  accounting  valuation and other costs  are expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred 
the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date 
intangible assets and goodwill 
we amortize finite lived intangible assets  including patents  acquired in purchase transactions over their expected useful lives 
when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite lived intangible asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we perform a test to determine whether the carrying amount of the asset or asset group tested exceeds its fair value 
recoverability of assets or asset group is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group over its life 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group  we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the recorded value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 
our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our single reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
we assign goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units based on the expected benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination and have identified one reporting unit 
when evaluating goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount 
if this assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we further evaluate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit through the use of discounted cash flow models 
the results of the models are compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if such comparison indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than the carrying amount  impairment would exist and the impairment charge would be measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded no such impairment charges 
contract settlements 
with respect to disputed contracts related to the ground infrastructure for our former meo satellite system  we recorded expenses according to our contractual obligation until such contract was terminated 
upon termination  and prior to settlement  we continued to accrue estimated late payment fees and interest expense  as applicable 
upon reaching settlement  whereby the other party s claims were legally released  we extinguished our recorded liability  resulting in the recognition of a gain or loss on contract settlement 
as of june   all unsettled contracts were transferred to the liquidating trust 
revenue recognition 
since mid  we have derived our operating revenue from ip licensing activities and fees earned from ip consulting services 
our patent licensing agreements typically provide for the payment of a contractually determined upfront license fee representing all or a majority of the licensing revenues that will be paid in exchange for a nonexclusive  nontransferable  limited duration license to intellectual property rights that we own or control 
these agreements typically include i a non exclusive license to make  sell  distribute  and use certain specified products that read on our patents licensed activities  ii a covenant not to enforce patent rights against the licensee based on the licensed activities  and iii the release of the licensee from certain claims 
fees earned from ip consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized from patent licensing activities depends on the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
agreements that are deemed to contain multiple elements are accounted for under accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
this guidance requires consideration to be allocated to each element of an agreement that has stand alone value using the relative fair value method 
we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii all material obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to agreement terms or services have been rendered to the customer  iii amounts are fixed or 
table of contents determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
as a result of the contractual terms of our patent license agreements and the unpredictable nature and frequency of licensing transactions  our revenue may fluctuate substantially from period to period 
stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires measurement of all share based payment awards based on the estimated fair value on the date of grant and the recognition of compensation cost over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
we record stock based compensation on stock options  stock appreciation rights  performance stock awards  restricted stock awards  restricted stock units and other stock awards issued to employees  directors  consultants and or advisors 
the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model based on the single option award approach 
the fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and either the quoted market price of our class a common stock on the date of grant for time based and performance based awards  or the fair value on the date of grant using the monte carlo simulation model monte carlo simulation for market based awards 
the fair value of stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units with service conditions are amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of stock appreciation rights  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units with performance conditions deemed probable of being achieved and cliff vesting is amortized to expense over the requisite service period using the straight line method of expense recognition 
the fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units with performance and market conditions are amortized to expense over the requisite service period using the straight line method of expense recognition 
the fair value of stock based payment awards as determined by the black scholes model and the monte carlo simulation are affected by our stock price as well as other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
since our utilization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income that is not assured  we have recorded a valuation allowance sufficient to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would decrease in the period in which we determined that the recovery was more likely than not to occur 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
as such  we are required to make many assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax positions and the likelihood whether such tax positions would be sustained if challenged 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time  and changes in our assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
contingencies 
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
asc  contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a 
table of contents liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued update no 
 comprehensive income update no 

update no 
requires in the presentation on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented
