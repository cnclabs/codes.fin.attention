management s discussion and analysis introduction kewaunee scientific corporation is a recognized leader in the design  manufacture and installation of laboratory  healthcare and technical furniture 
the company s corporate headquarters are located in statesville  north carolina 
the company s manufacturing facilities are located in statesville and bangalore  india 
the company has subsidiaries in singapore and bangalore that serve the asian and middle east markets 
kewaunee scientific s website is located at www 
kewaunee 
com 
our products are primarily sold through purchase orders and contracts submitted by customers through our dealers and commissioned agents  a national distributor  and through competitive bids submitted by us and our subsidiaries 
products are sold principally to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  industrial  chemical and commercial research laboratories  educational institutions  healthcare institutions  governmental entities  manufacturing facilities and users of networking furniture 
we consider the markets in which we compete to be highly competitive  with a significant amount of the business involving competitive public bidding 
it is common in the laboratory and healthcare furniture industries for customer orders to require delivery at extended future dates  as products are frequently to be installed in buildings yet to be constructed 
changes or delays in building construction may cause delays in delivery of the orders and our recognition of the sale 
since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry  we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between quotation of an order and delivery of the product 
the impact of such possible increases is considered when determining the sales price 
the principal raw materials and products manufactured by others used in our products are cold rolled carbon and stainless steel  hardwood lumbers and plywood  paint  chemicals  resins  hardware  plumbing and electrical fittings 
such materials and products are purchased from multiple suppliers and are typically readily available 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition a portion of our product sales result from fixed price construction contracts 
in these instances  we are usually in the role of a subcontractor  but in some cases may enter into a contract directly with the end user of the products 
our contract arrangements 
table of contents normally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered items 
product sales resulting from fixed price construction contracts are generated from multiple element arrangements that require separate units of accounting and estimates regarding the fair value of individual elements 
the company has determined that its multiple element arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting are product sales and installation services 
there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for both the product sales and installation services  and allocation of arrangement consideration for each of these units is based on their relative fair values 
each of these elements represents individual units of accounting  as the delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis 
the company s products are regularly sold on a stand alone basis to customers which provides vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the fair value of installation services is separately calculated using expected costs of installation services 
many times the value of installation services is calculated using price quotations from subcontractors to the company  who perform installation services on a stand alone basis 
assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met  we recognize revenue for product sales at the date of shipment 
product sales resulting from purchase orders involve a purchase order received by us from our dealers or our stocking distributor 
this category includes product sales for standard products  as well as products which require some customization 
these sales are recognized under the terms of the purchase order which generally are freight on board fob shipping point and do not include rights of return 
accordingly  these sales are recognized at the time of shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves management judgments and estimates 
we evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  or a project dispute makes it unlikely that all of the receivable owed by a customer will be collected  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded to reduce the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  a general reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
inventories the majority of inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market under the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold  and  therefore  recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw materials and other inventory costs more quickly than other methods 
inventories at our international subsidiaries are measured on the first in  first out fifo method 
pension benefits we sponsor pension plans covering all employees who met eligibility requirements as of april  in february  our pension plans were amended as of april  no further benefits have been  or will be  earned under the plans subsequent to the amendment date  and no additional participants have been  or will be  added to the plans 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate used to calculate and determine benefit obligations and expected return on plan assets within certain guidelines 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may significantly affect the amount of pension income or expense recorded by us in future periods

outlook our ability to predict future demand for our products continues to be limited given our role as subcontractor or supplier to dealers for subcontractors 
demand for our products is also dependent upon the number of laboratory construction projects planned and or current progress in projects already under construction 
our earnings are also impacted by increased costs of raw materials  including stainless steel  wood  and epoxy resin  and whether we are able to increase product prices to customers in amounts that correspond to such increases without materially and adversely affecting sales 
additionally  since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry  we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between the quotation of an order and delivery of a product 
we are also unable to predict the timing and strength of the global economic recovery and its short term and long term impact on our operations and the markets in which we compete 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the area of interest rates 
this exposure is associated with advances outstanding under our bank line of credit and certain lease obligations for production machinery  all of which are priced on a floating rate basis 
advances outstanding under the bank line of credit were million at april  in june  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby the interest rate payable on the outstanding principal balance of our million term loan was effectively converted to a fixed rate of 
in july  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby the interest rate payable on million of outstanding advances under the revolving credit facility effectively converted to a fixed interest rate of for the period beginning august  and ending august  we entered into these interest rate swaps to mitigate future interest rate risk associated with borrowings under the credit facility 
we believe that our exposure to market risk is not material
