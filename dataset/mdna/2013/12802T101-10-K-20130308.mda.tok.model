item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
fiscal performance we generated a loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   which includes million of after tax  non cash impairment charges related to fixed assets 
also included in the results for is an after tax  non cash gain of million related to the marked to market adjustment of the derivative liability associated with our convertible debt 
this compares to a loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   which included million of after tax  non cash impairment charges related to fixed assets 
our results were significantly and adversely affected by several factors 
first  three of our most profitable assets were undergoing scheduled regulatory drydocks during the first quarter second  due to a weaker than expected spot market for diving work  one of our dp saturation dive support vessels  the kestrel  did not consistently work at a profitable level after completing its drydock in the first quarter this vessel had been highly utilized during for a domestic operator on a decommissioning and salvage campaign from prior hurricane damage 
third  our multi service vessel  the uncle john  had two unexpected operational downtime occurrences during the year  the first from tropical storm debby during the second quarter and the second resulting from a third party riser system that failed and caused operations to cease during the third quarter finally  although diving activity in australia continued to be strong during  the level of activity decreased significantly after the completion of the large gorgon project early in to meet the challenging market conditions in  management completed a number of major transactions and took certain actions to place the company in a stronger position to address the cyclicality and seasonality of the marine construction business 
first  we amended our credit agreement to provide the company with  among other things  flexibility on certain financial covenants and ratios  and we completed the sale of million of notes  which allowed the company to repay a significant portion of our secured term debt and replace it with unsecured debt 
second  we comprehensively reviewed the company asset base and strategically divested of approximately million of non core  non strategic assets  the proceeds of which were also used to repay a portion of the term loan and we continue to market other non core  non strategic assets that are held for sale  the proceeds of which we expect to use to repay debt 
third  we restructured our onshore operations  including a headcount reduction  which we expect will improve results through significant cost savings 
fourth  we continued our service line diversification strategy by entering the light well intervention business and also continued our international expansion into a number of geographic areas around the world  with the result that was the first year in which international revenues exceeded us domestic revenues 
market conditions and outlook we continued to experience a challenging market in the us gulf of mexico ocs in capital spending by customers on new construction in the us gulf of mexico remained suppressed following the macondo well blow out in and due to the decrease in natural gas prices early in  pricing pressures continue to impact margins 
there continues to be uncertainty in the market regarding the us regulatory environment for our industry  uncertainty around commodity prices  as well as uncertainty in global economic stability 
we believe these uncertainties will continue to suppress our customers spending levels in the new construction market in the us gulf of mexico ocs for the near term 
although it is unclear how long the challenging market conditions will continue  we believe the intermediate and long term outlook for our business remains favorable in domestic markets as offshore drilling in the us gulf of mexico ocs is improving  with an increased emphasis on oil and condensates 
additionally  the permitting approval environment is improving and we expect increases in both new construction and decommissioning and salvage work during 
table of contents internationally  we continued to see strong activity levels in the markets we serve 
in mexico  high levels of drilling activity and pipeline construction is expected to provide opportunities for additional work in the region 
in  we successfully completed two large projects in mexico for pemex and entered into a two year bareboat charter of the kestrel with a major mexican contractor that commenced during the fourth quarter and will keep the vessel booked through the latter half of we also worked as a subcontractor for other marine contractors on projects for pemex 
we generated nearly million in revenue in our mexico market during also  we successfully expanded into west africa in  where we have completed a diving project for a major international contractor 
australia diving activity remained at high levels throughout the year  with the first and fourth quarters of which is its summer and more active work season producing strong results 
in australia  we have expanded our services to include saturation diving in addition to surface diving to participate further in the large liquefied natural gas projects in the region 
our international outlook remains positive 
our consolidated revenue mix for the year ended december  was international revenue and domestic revenue 
our international revenue is expected to increase as we continue to implement our strategy to diversify our operations outside of the us gulf of mexico 
vessel utilization we believe vessel utilization is a key performance metric for our business 
utilization is a strong indicator of demand for our vessels and  as a result  the contract rates we may charge for our services 
as a marine contractor with significant operations in the us gulf of mexico  our vessel utilization is typically lower during the winter and early spring due to unfavorable weather conditions in the us gulf of mexico 
accordingly  we attempt to schedule our drydock inspections and other routine and preventative maintenance programs during this period 
from time to time  we temporarily remove from service certain vessels based on current market conditions 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters typically leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
a significant portion of our international revenues  particularly in the southeast asia and australia regions  are derived from our provision of diving services without the use of company owned vessels 
for example  we provide surface diving services from third party vessels or structures  and we provide saturation diving services from our portable saturation diving systems placed on chartered vessels  the customer vessel or other third party vessels  and in some cases from a third party portable saturation diving system 
as a result  we will realize additional revenues in these international regions that will not be reflected in our utilization rates 
the following table shows the effective utilization of our vessels during the past three fiscal years utilization utilization utilization saturation diving surface and mixed gas diving construction barges entire fleet effective vessel utilization is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels generated revenues by the total number of days the vessels were available for operation in each year  including those temporarily removed from service  but excluding vessels permanently removed from service or while in drydock 

table of contents results of operations revenues year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except revenues revenues decreased in from by million  or due to a decline in domestic revenues 
in the first quarter  three of our largest assets were in drydock and did not generate revenue 
additionally  the kestrel was deployed on lower margin projects after completing its drydock until we successfully secured a two year bareboat charter in mexico during the fourth quarter this vessel was highly utilized on a higher margin project for most of the decline in domestic revenues was partially offset by an increase in international revenues  mainly due to growth in mexico and our expansion into west africa  with australia revenues decreasing due to less diving activity in compared to although total fleet utilization increased to in from in  revenues for included a significant amount of diving activity performed from third party vessels in australia that is not reflected in our vessel utilization 
revenues decreased in from by million  or  mostly due to the decline in vessel utilization to in from in this decrease was primarily the result of reduced activity in the us gulf of mexico in resulting from slower than expected recovery in permitting activity levels and continued uncertainty in the region  compared to the year ended december  when activity levels were temporarily higher due to oil spill cleanup efforts following the macondo well blowout 
offsetting this decline were revenues related to strong diving and third party vessel activity in australia  the successful execution of a large construction project in the bahamas which was completed in the second quarter of  the substantial completion of a successful pipelay project in mexico in the fourth quarter of and the commencement of a second pipelay project in mexico in the fourth quarter of that was completed in gross profit loss year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except gross profit loss results decreased in from by million to a gross loss of million 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily the result of the regulatory drydock of three of our most profitable assets during the first quarter  the kestrel working on lower margin projects in compared to higher utilization and margins in  weather disruptions during the second quarter  and an unexpected interruption in the operations of one of our largest assets which idled the vessel for almost half of the third quarter also  profit in australia declined with the completion of the significant gorgon project in early these declines were partially offset by increased profit in mexico due to increased activity and in west africa due to our expansion into the region 
gross profit decreased in from by million  or 
this decrease was primarily the result of lower margins in the us gulf of mexico in resulting from slower than expected recovery in permitting activity levels and therefore lower utilization compared to activity levels and margins in were temporarily higher due to oil spill cleanup efforts following the macondo well blowout 

table of contents selling and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except in thousands  except selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues selling and administrative expenses decreased in from by million  or primarily due to our cost saving initiatives  including headcount reductions during the second half of  as well as lower litigation costs 
during the third quarter we had further headcount reductions as part of a restructuring plan in response to challenging market conditions in the us gulf of mexico 
included in selling and administrative expenses for and are severance costs of million and million  respectively 
selling and administrative expenses decreased in from by million  or primarily due to our cost saving initiatives  as well as decreases in certain accruals relating to certain employee benefit plans 
these were partially offset by million in severance costs related to headcount reductions in goodwill impairment year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except goodwill impairment due to the significant decline in our market capitalization  adverse changes in the business climate and significant declines in operating results during  we wrote off the entire balance of million of goodwill 
as a result of this impairment  we do not carry an amount for goodwill as of december  or there were no comparable goodwill impairment charges during or asset impairments year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except asset impairments as part of a restructuring plan to reduce costs and repay debt in response to a challenging us gulf of mexico market  during the third and fourth quarters of we entered into a plan to sell four dive support vessels  two construction barges  four portable saturation diving systems and two facilities 
in conjunction with placing these assets as held for sale  we recorded million of pre tax impairment charges over the third and fourth quarters of related to the adjustment of the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
these assets are recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december  during the first quarter we incurred million in pre tax impairment charges relating to a non core asset  reducing the fair value of the asset to zero 
during and we incurred million and million  respectively  of pre tax impairment charges related to certain fixed assets 
in  these impairment charges included a dive support vessel that experienced low utilization in the southeast asia region  and an idle shallow water pipelay barge from which most of its equipment had been removed 
in  these impairment charges included four construction barges  for which the outlook for their future utilization was uncertain 

table of contents gain on sales of assets and other income expense  net year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except gain on sales of assets and other other income expense  net in  we sold a dive support vessel  our singapore facility and other assets  including a construction barge  and miscellaneous equipment for an aggregate of million and we recorded a net gain on the sales of million  including a loss of million we recognized on the sale of the dive support vessel 
the dive support vessel and our singapore facility were recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december  in we sold miscellaneous equipment to various third parties for million  and we recognized a net gain on the sales of million 
we also sold our sabine pass facility  one of our barges that was previously damaged by fire and miscellaneous equipment to various third parties for an aggregate of million  and we recognized a net gain on the sales of million 
during  we received an insurance settlement in the amount of million for a specific claim incurred in a prior year related to a fire that damaged one of our barges 
in  we sold a portable saturation diving system to a third party for cash proceeds totaling million and recognized a gain on the sale of million 
we sold two utility vessels to different third parties for million and recognized a gain on the sale of million 
other income expense is primarily from foreign currency gains and losses on transactions conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
recovery of doubtful accounts year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except recovery of doubtful accounts no provision for doubtful accounts was recorded during  or the million reversal of provision for doubtful accounts during relates to the collection of a receivable that was previously reserved as bad debt on a west africa project 
the million reversal of provision for doubtful accounts recorded during relates to the collection of trade receivables from the court administering the bankruptcy of a previous customer 
interest expense year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands  except interest expense  net interest expense adjustment to conversion feature of convertible debt the increase in interest expense  net in from is primarily due to the accretion of the debt discount related to our convertible debt through interest expense over the term of our notes 
additionally  interest expense increased due to a higher applicable margin on our variable interest rate debt and an increase in the average amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility during cash paid for interest on our indebtedness was million  million and million for  and  respectively 

table of contents the increase in interest expense  net in from is primarily due to changes in variable interest rates 
during  we recorded a million pre tax net gain for the marked to market adjustment of the fair value of our derivative liability related to the conversion feature of the notes 
the adjustment reflects the decrease in our stock price during the period and a decrease in the yields 
income tax expense benefit year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands in thousands income tax expense benefit including goodwill and fixed asset impairment charges our effective tax rate was  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the effective tax benefit rate for differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the mix of pre tax profit or loss between us and international taxing jurisdictions with varying statutory rates 
additionally  we recorded a million valuation allowance during the fourth quarter related to certain foreign tax credits and foreign losses 
the effective tax benefit rate for differs from the statutory rate primarily due to a one time change in the management structure of certain foreign operations and the transfer pricing agreements between the us and certain foreign subsidiaries as well as the recognition of a valuation allowance related to certain foreign tax credits 
the effective tax benefit rate for differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the impairment charge on non deductible goodwill recorded in this impairment charge decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 
loss attributable to cal dive year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except per share data in thousands  except and per share data loss attributable to cal dive weighted average diluted shares outstanding diluted loss per share the loss for decreased from primarily due to the recognition of a larger impairment charge during and the benefit recorded during the third quarter for the marked to market adjustment of the fair value of our derivative liability related to the conversion feature of our notes 
loss  including the impairment charges  for improved from by million  or  and diluted loss per share improved from by  or mostly as a result of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in liquidity and capital resources we require capital to fund ongoing operations  organic growth initiatives and pursue joint ventures or acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations  available cash and cash equivalents and availability under our revolving credit facility 
we use  and intend to continue using  these sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements  maintenance capital expenditures  strategic investments and acquisitions 

table of contents we expect to be able to fund our activities for the next months with cash flows generated from our operations  available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
however  our liquidity to fund our business activities and achieve our near term and long term objectives has been adversely affected by the challenging market conditions during and that we have discussed elsewhere in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under fiscal performance and market conditions and outlook 
due to our reliance on our revolving credit facility  continuing unfavorable market conditions could have a more direct and adverse impact on our liquidity position 
on july   we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes 
we received approximately million of net proceeds  after deducting the initial purchasers commissions and transaction expenses 
we used all of the net proceeds to repay a significant portion of the term loan under our senior secured credit facility 
additionally  we have prepaid million of the term loan during with net proceeds from the sale of assets 
at december   we had an outstanding principal balance under the term loan of million 
based on this remaining balance  the quarterly principal payments will be million until june  when such payments will increase to million for the duration of the remaining term of the credit agreement 
a final payment on the term loan of approximately million will be due at maturity on april  pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  the required quarterly principal payments may be reduced based on the pro rata prepayment of the term loan 
at december   we had million borrowed and million of letters of credit issued and outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
outstanding warranty and bid bonds at december  were million 
at december   we had million of cash on hand and million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
the availability under our revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding borrowings and letters of credit  and can be limited by our consolidated leverage debt to earnings before interest  income taxes and depreciation and amortization or ebitda as defined in the credit agreement ratio covenant at each quarter end and by our collateral coverage sublimit 
however  our revolver is not restricted during the year provided we are in compliance with existing financial covenants 
credit facility we have a credit agreement providing for a senior secured credit facility  consisting of a variable interest term loan and a variable interest million revolving credit facility  with certain financial institutions  which matures on april  at december   we had outstanding term loan debt of million  including current maturities and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we may prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the term loan without prepayment penalty 
we have classified certain non core assets as held for sale at december  we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of these assets to repay debt under the credit agreement 
we may borrow from or repay the revolving credit facility as business needs merit 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants under our credit agreement 
effective july   we amended our credit agreement to  among other things i allow us to issue convertible senior notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million  that may be converted into cash  common stock or a combination of cash and common stock  so long as a any such notes mature at least six months after expiration of the credit agreement  b such notes are not required to be prepaid prior to their stated maturity other than as specifically permitted  c the covenants governing such notes  taken as a whole  are no more restrictive than the credit agreement covenants  and d all of the net proceeds of such notes are used to prepay outstanding amounts under the credit agreement  ii exclude the unsecured indebtedness evidenced by any convertible senior notes from the definition of consolidated funded indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement  which then results in the exclusion of such unsecured indebtedness from the calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio  and iii require us to maintain a threshold of million in liquidity defined to include unused capacity under the revolving loan portion of the credit agreement and immediately available cash held in deposit accounts of any loan party in certain circumstances where cash payments are made on any convertible senior notes as a result of any conversion of such notes into cash  in whole or in part 
effective november   we entered into a further amendment to our credit agreement to  among other things  i increase the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio for the fiscal quarter ended december  to not more than x  and ii increase the amount permitted under sale leaseback transactions to million per year 
as part of the amendment  the size of the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement was permanently reduced from million to million on november  
table of contents convertible notes the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  commencing january   and mature on july  we may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date 
prior to april   holders may not convert their notes all or a portion thereof except under certain circumstances 
these circumstances  as set forth in the indenture governing the notes  relate to i the price of our common stock  ii the price of the notes  or iii upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
on and after april  until the maturity date  holders may convert all or a portion of their notes at any time 
upon conversion of a note  we will pay or deliver  at our election  cash  shares of our common stock or a combination thereof  based on an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of our common stock and represents an approximately premium over the closing sale price of our common stock on july   which was per share 
upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes  holders of the notes will have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of such notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
upon the occurrence of certain significant corporate transactions  holders who convert their notes in connection with a change of control may be entitled to a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate 
additionally  the notes contain certain events of default as set forth in the indenture 
as of december   none of the conditions allowing holders of the notes to convert  or requiring us to repurchase the notes  had been met 
our intent is to repay the principal amount of the notes in cash and the conversion feature in shares of our common stock 
in the event of a conversion of the notes prior to our obtaining stockholder approval of the issuance of shares of our common stock in excess of the nyse limitation  we will be required to pay cash to converting holders in lieu of delivering shares of our common stock in excess of such limitation 
capital expenditures during the year ended december   we incurred million for equipment purchases  improvements and replacements and million for regulatory drydock costs 
for  we expect capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions or investments in joint ventures  to approximate million  primarily related to maintenance such as regulatory drydock costs 
our capital expenditure program for is subject to market conditions  including activity levels  commodity prices and industry capacity 
we currently anticipate funding our capital expenditures through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash flows our cash flows depend on the level of spending by oil and natural gas companies for marine contracting services 
certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  issuance and repurchases of debt and of our common stock  are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during compared to million in the low cash provided by operations for was primarily driven by our loss recorded adjusted for non cash items  such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  asset impairments and the marked to market adjustment of our derivative liability related to the conversion feature of the notes  as well as changes in working capital 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million during compared to million during during the years ended december  and  capital expenditures were million and million  respectively 
cash generated from the sale of property and equipment was million for primarily from the sale of a dive support vessel  our singapore facility and the sale leaseback of one our domestic facilities  as well as other smaller assets 
cash generated of million in was from an insurance recovery for a specific claim and the sales of our sabine pass facility and a construction barge 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million during during  we made principal payments of million under our term loan with the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and the sale of assets during in addition to the required quarterly principal payments and had net borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility in line with our normal working capital requirements 
during the year ended december   we made principal payments of million under our term loan and had no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december  contractual and other obligations we lease several facilities worldwide and accommodations for certain employees located outside the us under non cancellable operating leases 
at december   our contractual obligations for long term debt  operating leases  purchase commitments and other payables were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years credit agreement obligations principal interest convertible notes due principal interest non cancellable operating leases and charters total contractual obligations includes amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  with repayment assumed at maturity of the credit agreement 
assumes an interest rate based on three month libor at december  plus a margin of and commitment fees of on the unused portion of the revolver 
assumes holders of the notes do not require repurchase of the notes prior to their maturity and assumes no conversion premium is paid

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
for information regarding our principles of consolidation  see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and policies our accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements and related notes  are subject to management evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors that could affect the ongoing viability of our business and our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are those described below 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
revenue recognition we determine the appropriate revenue recognition accounting method for each of our contracts at the beginning of the project 
most of our revenues are derived from contracts that have a short duration 
these contracts contain either qualified lump sum provisions or provisions for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
revenue generated from qualified lump sum contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors may affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project completion and  therefore  delay the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings on a current basis 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when it is first determined as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
we recognize additional contract revenue related to claims when the claim is probable and legally enforceable 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we follow the accounting guidelines for the performance of construction type contracts 
the use of this method is based on our experience and history of being able to prepare reasonably dependable estimates of the cost to complete our projects 
although we constantly seek to improve our ability to estimate revenue  contract costs and profitability  adjustments to total contract costs due to unanticipated events could be significant in future periods 
if different estimates were used for determining costs to complete projects  the amount of revenue and associated profit recognized could differ from what was recorded 
revenues generated from specific time  materials and equipment contracts are generally earned on a dayrate basis and recognized as delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
property and equipment property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we depreciate our assets on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
the following is a summary of the estimated useful lives of our asset classes description years vessels portable saturation diving systems machinery and equipment buildings  leasehold improvements and other major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel economic useful life or functional operating capability  are capitalized and depreciated over their economic useful lives 
we expense the costs of repairs and maintenance which do not materially prolong the useful life of the property and equipment as incurred 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 

table of contents we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 
we base our evaluation on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions 
if such impairment indicators are present  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through projected net undiscounted cash flows based on expected operating results over the remaining life of the asset 
the cash flows are based on historical data adjusted for management estimates of future market performance that rely on existing market data  industry trends  expected utilization and margins 
if we determine that an impairment of a long lived asset has occurred  we recognize a loss on our financial statements equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on an estimate of discounted cash flows the asset will generate in the future 
the development of future cash flows and the determination of fair value for an asset involve significant judgment and estimates 
management estimates may vary considerably from actual outcomes due to future adverse market conditions  poor operating results  or other factors that could result in our inability to recover the current carrying value of long lived assets  which could possibly require an impairment charge in the future 
derivative instruments and fair value measurements embedded conversion feature we have issued convertible debt which is indexed to  and can be settled in  shares of our common stock 
we assess the initial classification of these instruments based on whether they meet the necessary conditions for equity classification 
for instruments that do not meet equity classification  we record them as a liability 
we reassess this classification at each balance sheet date 
fair value measurements the standard on fair value measurements defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or non recurring basis 
this standard defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability  such as inherent risk  transfer restrictions  and risk of nonperformance 
this standard also establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
a financial instrument categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
this standard establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or level unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
the valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value are as follows a market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 

table of contents b income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about those future amounts  including present value 
critical estimates used in this approach include discount rates  useful lives and scrap values 
c cost approach based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset replacement cost 
income taxes we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the current provision for income tax is based upon the current tax laws and our interpretation of these laws  as well as the probable outcomes of any foreign or domestic tax audits 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we compute deferred income taxes using the liability method 
we provide for deferred income taxes on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates  applicable to future years 
allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions to the provisions for income taxes 
our most significant judgments on tax related matters include tax valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions 
these matters involve the exercise of significant judgment which could change and materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
the realization of our deferred tax assets depends on recognition of sufficient future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions during periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be recovered 
in evaluating our valuation allowance  we consider the reversal of existing temporary differences  the existence of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies and future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions  the latter two of which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
changes to our valuation allowance could materially impact our results of operations 
we have liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions connected with ongoing examinations and open tax years 
changes in our assessment of these liabilities may require us to increase the liability and record additional tax expense or reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit which would negatively or positively impact our effective tax rate 
we do not provide for us income taxes on foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
for financial reporting purposes  our provision for income taxes has been computed on the basis that we have completed and filed separate federal income tax returns for all periods presented 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices  customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies 
depending on how these issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
loss contingencies we accrue loss contingency reserves when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of our liabilities are based on an evaluation of potential outcomes and currently available facts 
we attempt to resolve these matters through settlements  mediation and arbitration proceedings when possible 
actual results may differ from our estimates  and our estimates can be revised in the future  either negatively or positively  depending upon actual outcomes or changes in expectations based on the facts surrounding each matter 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of certain new accounting pronouncements that may affect our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in our normal business activities 
market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with existing or forecasted financial transactions 
the types of market risks to which we are exposed are credit risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and equity price risk 
credit risk 
our financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
cash equivalents such as deposits and temporary cash investments are held by major banks 
our trade receivables are with a variety of us  international and foreign country national oil and natural gas companies 
management considers this credit risk to be limited due to the financial resources of these companies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we occasionally require collateral in the form of bank guarantees or letters of credit to support contractual payment obligations 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses 
interest rate risk 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility 
changes based on the floating interest rates under this facility could result in an increase or decrease in our annual interest expense and related cash outlay 
in may  we entered into a twelve month interest rate swap with a notional amount of million that converts a portion of our anticipated variable rate interest payments under our term loan to fixed rate interest payments of 
this interest rate swap began to settle in december and expired in december in august  we entered into another twelve month interest rate swap with a notional amount of million that converts the same portion of our anticipated variable rate interest payments under our term loan to fixed rate interest payments of 
this interest rate swap began to settle in december and will expire in december we expect the current interest rate swap to effectively fix our variable interest payments made on million of debt  an amount greater than the amount outstanding under our credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was at december   including the average applicable loan margin of approximately 
as the fixed rate interest payments under our interest rate swap is greater than the quoted interest rates as of december   a hypothetical increase of in the quoted interest rates would not impact total interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have operations in foreign locations that subject us to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
although the vast majority of our business is transacted in us dollars  we transact business in euro dollars  mexican pesos  singapore dollars  australian dollars  and nigerian naira  among others 
historically  foreign currency exchange rate risk has not been material to our business and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
at various times  we utilize the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities  cash flows and commitments denominated in certain foreign currencies 
as we continue to grow our international operations  foreign currency exchange rate risk may become more significant and we may mitigate our foreign currency risk with foreign currency derivative instruments in the future 
equity price risk 
the conversion feature embedded in the notes constitutes a derivative liability that is required to be separately accounted for from the underlying debt instrument at fair value 
assumptions used to model the estimated fair value of the derivative liability include our stock price and its volatility 
the value of the derivative liability is sensitive to both the price of our common stock and its volatility 
holding all other assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of to our stock price could result in a loss or gain of approximately million 
additionally  increases in our stock price could result in additional dilution to our common stockholders if conversion of the notes is settled in shares of our common stock
