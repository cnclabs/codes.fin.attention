item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see the cautionary statement and risk factors above for discussions of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our fiscal year end financial reporting periods are a or week year ending on the saturday closest to december st 
fiscal  and were week years and ended on december   december  and january   respectively 
overview we design and develop proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal integrated circuits ics for a broad range of applications 
mixed signal ics are electronic components that convert real world analog signals  such as sound and radio waves  into digital signals that electronic products can process 
therefore  mixed signal ics are critical components in products addressing a variety of markets  including communications  consumer  industrial and automotive 
our major customers include cisco  huawei  lg electronics  pace  panasonic  sagem  samsung  technicolor  varian medical systems and zte 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we rely on third party semiconductor fabricators in asia  and to a lesser extent the united states and europe  to manufacture the silicon wafers that reflect our ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we rely on third parties in asia to assemble  package  and  in most cases  test these devices and ship these units to our customers 
testing performed by such third parties facilitates faster delivery of products to our customers particularly those located in asia  shorter production cycle times  lower inventory requirements  lower costs and increased flexibility of test capacity 
our expertise in analog intensive  high performance  mixed signal ics enables us to develop highly differentiated solutions that address multiple markets 
we group our products into the following categories broad based products  which include our microcontrollers  timing products clocks and oscillators  power and isolation devices  and touch controllers  broadcast products  which include our broadcast audio and video products  access products  which include our voice over ip voip products  embedded modems and our power over ethernet poe devices  and mature products  which include certain devices that are at the end of their respective life cycles and therefore receive minimal or no continued research and development investment 
through acquisitions and internal development efforts  we have continued to diversify our product portfolio and introduce next generation ics with added functionality and further integration 
on july   we acquired ember corporation  a privately held company 
ember products integrate high performance  low power ghz wireless ics with reliable and scalable software into a flexible and robust networking platform 
we believe that this strategic acquisition provides us with the technology and software expertise required to enable the low power mesh sensor networks being deployed today in a wide range of residential  commercial and industrial applications 
see note  acquisitions  for additional information 
in fiscal  we introduced the precision bit mixed signal microcontroller family  based on a patented architecture that provides customers with flexibility  performance and low power 
we also introduced a digital relative humidity rh and temperature sensor on a chip solution  low jitter clock buffers with high integration of clock tree functions  a crystal less usb to i s audio bridge 
table of contents designed to support a wide range of codecs and digital to analog converters dacs  a family of digital isolators that are drop in replacements for optocouplers  high performance bit microcontrollers featuring an integrated temperature sensor with best in class accuracy  two next generation ezradio wireless ics designed to simplify the addition of high performance wireless connectivity to cost sensitive embedded applications  advanced am fm receivers tuned for the high end consumer and professional audio equipment market  a family of tv tuners offering both best in class rf performance and support for all worldwide tv standards  a multimedia demodulator that merges all digital video broadcast dvb standards into a single chip solution  isolated analog to digital adc converters designed specifically for the demands of mains line monitoring  a single port poe controller that brings plug and play simplicity to embedded power sourcing equipment pse designs  high performance  low power sub ghz transceivers designed to maximize range and battery life for wireless systems  ultra small and low power customizable clock generators ideal for space limited  cost sensitive embedded and consumer electronics and the expansion of our clocking solutions to address the stringent specifications of the pci express pcie generation standards 
we plan to continue to introduce products that increase the content we provide for existing applications  thereby enabling us to serve markets we do not currently address and expanding our total available market opportunity 
during fiscal and  we had one customer  samsung  whose purchases across a variety of product areas represented and of our revenues  respectively 
we had no customers that accounted for more than of our revenues during fiscal in addition to direct sales to customers  some of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors and contract manufacturers 
an end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer 
although we actually sell the products to  and are paid by  the distributors and contract manufacturers  we refer to such end customer as our customer 
two of our distributors  edom technology and avnet  represented and of our revenues during fiscal  respectively 
edom  avnet and macnica  represented  and of our revenues during fiscal  respectively 
edom and avnet represented and of our revenues during fiscal  respectively 
there were no other distributors or contract manufacturers that accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal  or the percentage of our revenues derived from outside of the united states was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we believe that a majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from customers outside of the united states 
the sales cycle for our ics can be as long as months or more 
an additional three to six months or more are usually required before a customer ships a significant volume of devices that incorporate our ics 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we typically experience a significant delay between incurring research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  and the corresponding sales 
consequently  if sales in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially  future quarters would be adversely affected 
moreover  the amount of time between initial research and development and commercialization of a product  if ever  can be substantially longer than the sales cycle for the product 
accordingly  if we incur substantial research and development costs without developing a commercially successful product  our operating results  as well as our growth prospects  could be adversely affected 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer products such as televisions  set top boxes  radios and mobile handsets  we expect that the demand for our products will be typically subject to some degree of seasonal demand 
however  rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas make it difficult for us to accurately estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business 

table of contents results of operations the following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of income revenues 
revenues are generated almost exclusively by sales of our ics 
we recognize revenue on sales when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales to direct customers and contract manufacturers upon shipment 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on products unsold by distributors 
accordingly  we defer the revenue and cost of revenue on such sales until the distributors sell the product to the end customer 
our products typically carry a one year replacement warranty 
replacements have been insignificant to date 
our revenues are subject to variation from period to period due to the volume of shipments made within a period  the mix of products we sell and the prices we charge for our products 
the vast majority of our revenues were negotiated at prices that reflect a discount from the list prices for our products 
these discounts are made for a variety of reasons  including to establish a relationship with a new customer  as an incentive for customers to purchase products in larger volumes  to provide profit margin to our distributors who resell our products or in response to competition 
in addition  as a product matures  we expect that the average selling price for such product will decline due to the greater availability of competing products 
our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to ship larger volumes of those products in response to such demand  as well as our ability to develop or acquire new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of those products  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance  costs of software royalties  other intellectual property license costs and certain acquired intangible assets  and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation  as well as new product masks  external consulting and services costs  equipment tooling  equipment depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
research and development activities include the design of new products  refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  applications engineering support  professional fees  legal fees and promotional and marketing expenses 
interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest on our short and long term obligations  including our credit facilities 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement adjustments as well as other non operating income and expenses 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes includes both domestic and foreign income taxes at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  research and development tax credits and other permanent differences 

table of contents the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues fiscal year change in millions change revenues the growth in revenues in fiscal was due primarily to market share gains and the addition of product revenues from the acquisition of ember in july unit volumes of our products increased compared to fiscal by 
average selling prices decreased compared to the same period by 
the average selling prices of our products may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in general  as our products become more mature  we expect to experience decreases in average selling prices 
we anticipate that newly announced  higher priced  next generation products and product derivatives will offset some of these decreases 
gross margin fiscal year change in millions change gross margin percent of revenue the increase in the dollar amount of gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to our increased sales  offset in part by an increase in acquisition related charges 
the decrease in gross margin as a percent of revenue was primarily due to changes in product mix 

table of contents we may experience declines in the average selling prices of certain of our products 
this creates downward pressure on gross margin as a percentage of revenues and may be offset to the extent we are able to introduce higher margin new products and gain market share with our ics  achieve lower production costs from our wafer suppliers and third party assembly and test subcontractors  achieve lower production costs per unit as a result of improved yields throughout the manufacturing process  or reduce logistics costs 
research and development fiscal year change in millions change research and development percent of revenue the increase in research and development expense in fiscal was principally due to an increase of million for personnel related expenses  including personnel costs associated with the acquisition of ember 
the decrease in research and development expense as a percent of revenues in fiscal is due to our increased revenues 
we expect that research and development expense will increase modestly in absolute dollars in the first quarter of recent development projects include a digital rh and temperature sensor on a chip solution  low jitter clock buffers with high integration of clock tree functions  a crystal less usb to i s audio bridge designed to support a wide range of codecs and dacs  a family of digital isolators that are drop in replacements for optocouplers  high performance bit microcontrollers featuring an integrated temperature sensor with best in class accuracy  two next generation ezradio wireless ics designed to simplify the addition of high performance wireless connectivity to cost sensitive embedded applications  advanced am fm receivers tuned for the high end consumer and professional audio equipment market  a family of tv tuners offering both best in class rf performance and support for all worldwide tv standards  a multimedia demodulator that merges all dvb standards into a single chip solution  isolated adc converters designed specifically for the demands of mains line monitoring  a single port poe controller that brings plug and play simplicity to embedded pse designs  the precision bit mixed signal microcontroller family  high performance  low power sub ghz transceivers designed to maximize range and battery life for wireless systems  ultra small and low power customizable clock generators ideal for space limited  cost sensitive embedded and consumer electronics  and the expansion of our clocking solutions to address the stringent specifications of the pcie generation standards 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year change in millions change selling  general and administrative percent of revenue the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was principally due to increases of a million for personnel related expenses  including severance related to a separation agreement between us and our former ceo  b million for legal fees  primarily related to litigation and acquisition related costs  and c million for product marketing costs 
the increase in fiscal was offset in part by a net gain of million from the purchase of our headquarters in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of revenues in fiscal is due to our increased revenues 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will remain relatively stable in absolute dollars in the first quarter of 
table of contents interest income interest income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal interest expense interest expense in fiscal was million compared to thousand in fiscal the increase in fiscal is principally due to interest on our term loan facility under our credit agreement 
other income expense  net other income expense  net in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal provision for income taxes fiscal year in millions change provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal decreased from the prior period  primarily due to the release of prior year unrecognized tax benefits that were determined to be effectively settled during the current period  along with one time nondeductible costs associated with the acquisition of spectra linear in fiscal the impact of these items was partially offset by the non renewal of the federal research and development tax credit in the current period 
the american taxpayer relief act of the act was enacted on january  the act retroactively reinstates the federal research and development credit from january   through december  the effect of the change in the tax law related to fiscal is estimated to be between million and million  which will be recognized as a benefit to income tax expense in the first quarter of fiscal  the quarter in which the law was enacted 
the effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the federal statutory rate of due to the amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than the federal statutory rate  research and development tax credits and other permanent items including changes to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues fiscal year change in millions change revenues unit volumes of our products decreased compared to fiscal by 
average selling prices increased during the same period by 
table of contents gross margin fiscal year change in millions change gross margin percent of revenue the decrease in gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to changes in product mix and charges related to the acquisition of spectra linear 
research and development fiscal year change in millions change research and development percent of revenue the increase in research and development expense in fiscal was primarily due to a an increase of million for personnel related expenses  including million for one time personnel costs associated with the acquisition of spectra linear  b an increase of million for amortization of intangible assets  and c million for the impairment of intangible assets 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year change in millions change selling  general and administrative percent of revenue the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was principally due to a a decrease of million for legal fees  and b a decline of million in the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration 
the decrease was offset in part by an increase of million for personnel related expenses  including million for one time personnel costs associated with the acquisition of spectra linear 
interest income interest income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal interest expense interest expense in fiscal was thousand compared to thousand in fiscal other income expense  net other income expense  net in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the change was primarily due to foreign currency remeasurement adjustments 

table of contents provision for income taxes fiscal year in millions change provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rate for fiscal increased from the prior period  primarily due to the tax charge related to the intercompany license of certain technology obtained in the acquisition of spectra linear and other one time nondeductible costs associated with the acquisition of spectra linear  a decrease in the foreign tax rate benefit  and a release of prior year unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal with none in fiscal these changes were partially offset by an increase in the research and development tax credit 
the effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the federal statutory rate of due to the amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than the federal statutory rate  research and development tax credits and other permanent items including changes to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
business outlook we expect revenues in the first quarter of fiscal to be down sequentially four to eight percent 
furthermore  we expect our diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  of which approximately million was held by our us entities 
the remaining balance was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
our cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of corporate bonds  money market funds  municipal bonds  us treasury bills  variable rate demand notes  us government bonds  asset backed securities and international government bonds 
our long term investments consisted of auction rate securities 
early in fiscal  auctions for many of our auction rate securities failed because sell orders exceeded buy orders 
as of december   we held million par value auction rate securities  all of which have experienced failed auctions 
these securities have contractual maturity dates ranging from to we are receiving the underlying cash flows on all of our auction rate securities 
the principal amounts associated with failed auctions are not expected to be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the security  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities mature 
we are unable to predict if these funds will become available before their maturity dates 
we do not expect to need access to the capital represented by any of our auction rate securities prior to their maturities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal operating cash flows during fiscal reflect our net income of million  adjustments of million for depreciation  gains on the purchase of property and equipment  amortization  stock based compensation and deferred income taxes  and a net cash outflow of million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities 

table of contents accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from an increase in shipments during the last quarter of fiscal compared to the last quarter of fiscal our average days sales outstanding dso was days at december  and days at december  inventory increased to million at december  from million at december  our inventory level is primarily impacted by our need to make purchase commitments to support forecasted demand and variations between forecasted and actual demand 
our average days of inventory doi was days at december  and days at december  net cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash used of million during fiscal the increase in cash outflows was principally due to increases of million for purchases of property and equipment and million in net payments for the acquisition of businesses  offset by an increase of million from net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities 
on july   we acquired ember  a privately held company  for approximately million  including contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of million at the date of acquisition 
on september   we purchased our corporate headquarters facilities 
see note  acquisitions  for additional information 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately to million for fiscal additionally  as part of our growth strategy  we expect to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses  intellectual property or technologies that would complement or expand our current offerings  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash used of million during fiscal the increase in cash inflows was principally due from net proceeds of million from the issuance of long term debt and outflows declining million for repurchases of our common stock 
in april  our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock through january debt on july   we entered into a million five year credit agreement the agreement 
the agreement consists of a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
the term loan facility provides for quarterly principal amortization equal to of the principal in each of the first two years and of the principal in each of the next three years with the remaining balance payable upon the maturity date 
the revolving credit facility includes a million letter of credit sublimit and a million swingline loan sublimit 
we have an option to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by up to an aggregate of million in additional commitments  subject to certain conditions 
on september   we borrowed million under the term loan facility 
to date  we have not borrowed under the revolving credit facility 
the term loan facility and revolving credit facility  other than swingline loans  will bear interest at libor plus an applicable margin or  at our option  a base rate defined as the highest of the bank of america prime rate  the federal funds rate plus and a daily rate equal to one month libor plus plus an applicable margin 
swingline loans accrue interest at a per annum rate based on the base rate plus the applicable margin for base rate loans 
the applicable margins for the libor rate loans range from to and for base rate loans range from to  depending in each case  on the leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
we also pay a commitment fee on the unused amount of the revolving credit facility 

table of contents in connection with the closing of the credit agreement  we entered into a security and pledge agreement 
under the security and pledge agreement  we pledged equity securities of certain of our subsidiaries  subject to exceptions and limitations 
the credit facilities contain various conditions  covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds and to avoid an event of default  including financial covenants that we must maintain a leverage ratio funded debt ebitda of no more than to and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda debt payments  income taxes and capital expenditures of no less than to as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants of the credit facilities 
see note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of research and development projects  potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  investments and credit under our credit facilities are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total thereafter long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations long term debt obligations represent the principal due under our term loan facility and include amounts classified as current portion of long term debt 
interest on our long term debt obligations is based on libor plus an applicable margin 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement as a hedge against the libor portion of such variable interest payments and effectively converted the libor portion of the interest on the term loan facility to a fixed interest rate through the maturity date 
as of december   the combined interest rate on the term loan facility was 
the impact of the interest rate swap was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on our long term debt obligations 
operating lease obligations include amounts for leased facilities 
purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders with suppliers where there is a fixed non cancelable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when or if cash settlement with taxing authorities will occur for our unrecognized tax benefits 
therefore  our liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above 
see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no significant off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and cost of revenues on sales to distributors  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation we assess the recoverability of inventories through the application of a set of methods  assumptions and estimates 
in determining net realizable value  we write down inventory that may be slow moving or have some form of obsolescence  including inventory that has aged more than months 
we also adjust the valuation of inventory when its standard cost exceeds the estimated market value less selling costs 
we assess the potential for any unusual customer returns based on known quality or business issues and write off inventory losses for scrap or non saleable material 
inventory not otherwise identified to be written down is compared to an assessment of our month forecasted demand 
the result of this methodology is compared against the product life cycle and competitive situations in the marketplace to determine the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those that we project 
in the event that actual demand is lower or market conditions are worse than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
stock based compensation we recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of our full value stock awards with the exception of market based performance awards equals the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of our market based performance award grants is estimated at the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation 
the fair value of our stock option and employee stock purchase plan grants is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
see note  stock based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
investments in auction rate securities we determine the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  amount of cash flows  expected holding periods of the securities and a discount to reflect our inability to liquidate the securities 
for available for sale auction rate securities  if the calculated value is below the carrying amount of the securities  we then determine if the decline in value is other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in underlying credit ratings  forecasted recovery  our intent to sell or the likelihood that we would be required to sell the investment before its anticipated recovery in market value and the probability that the scheduled cash payments will continue to be made 
when we conclude that an other than temporary impairment has occurred  we assess whether we intend to sell the security or if it 
table of contents is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery 
if either of these two conditions is met  we recognize a charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security amortized cost basis and its fair value 
if we do not intend to sell a security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery  the unrealized loss is separated into an amount representing the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and the amount related to all other factors  which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
acquired intangible assets when we acquire a business  a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technology and customer relationships 
fair value of these assets is determined primarily using the income approach  which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate 
we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their expected useful lives 
our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
incorrect estimates could result in future impairment charges  and those charges could be material to our results of operations 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including fixed assets and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
income taxes we are required to calculate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves calculating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income loss for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we are required to estimate the amount of expected future taxable income 
judgment is inherent in this process and differences between the estimated and actual taxable income could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition  therefore  we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this measurement step is inherently complex and requires subjective 
table of contents estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  expirations of statutes of limitation  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax 
we believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with subtopic if an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then no further action is required 
if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
entities are required to disclose both gross and net information about these instruments 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income our investment portfolio includes cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after tax returns on our investment portfolio 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
our investment portfolio holdings as of december  and december  yielded less than basis points 
a decline in yield to zero basis points on our investment portfolio holdings as of december  and december  would decrease our annual interest income by approximately million and million  respectively 
we believe that our investment policy  which defines the duration  concentration  and minimum credit quality of the allowable investments  meets our investment objectives 
interest expense we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business  including through our credit facilities 
the interest payments on the facility are calculated using a variable rate 
table of contents of interest 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million equal to the full amount borrowed under the term loan facility and  effectively  converted the variable rate interest payments on the term loan facility to fixed rate interest payments through july investments in auction rate securities beginning in fiscal  auctions for many of our auction rate securities failed because sell orders exceeded buy orders 
as of december   we held million par value auction rate securities  all of which have experienced failed auctions
