item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit facilities 
access to funds under these existing credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding requirements 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding requirements if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time  and we might be forced to replace credit sources in a difficult market 
there have also been recent consolidations in the banking industry which could lead to increased reliance on and exposure to a limited number of institutions 
if we cannot obtain adequate financing or sources of credit on favorable terms  or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted 

table of contents changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
developments in accounting practices  for example a convergence of us gaap with international financial reporting standards ifrs  may require considerable additional expense to comply  particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted and may be significant 
the impact may affect the results of our operations  including among other things  the calculation of net income  and may affect our financial position  including among other things  the calculation of unpaid losses and loss expenses  policy benefits for life and annuity contracts and total shareholders equity 
operational risks  including human or systems failures  are inherent in our business 
operational risks and losses can result from many sources including fraud  errors by employees  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements or information technology failures 
we believe our modeling  underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our business and reputation 
moreover  our technology and applications have been an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully 
such technology is and will continue to be a very important part of our underwriting process 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable service providers  or that our technology or applications will continue to operate as intended 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace these service providers or consultants without slowing our underwriting response time 
a major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in management distraction  harm to our reputation  a loss or delay of revenues or increased expense 
the loss of key executive officers could adversely affect us 
our success has depended  and will continue to depend  partly upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers 
if any of these executives ceased to continue in his or her present role  we could be adversely affected 
we believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we compete 
our ability to execute our business strategy is dependent on our ability to attract and retain a staff of qualified executive officers  underwriters and other key personnel 
the skills  experience and knowledge of the reinsurance industry of our management team constitute important competitive strengths 
if some or all of these managers leave their positions  and even if we were able to find persons with suitable skills to replace them  our operations could be adversely affected 
risks related to our industry our profitability is affected by the cyclical nature of the reinsurance industry 
historically  the reinsurance industry has experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition  levels of available capacity  trends in cash flows and losses  general economic conditions and other factors 
demand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting results of primary insurers  including catastrophe losses  and prevailing general economic conditions 
the supply of reinsurance is related directly to prevailing prices and levels of capacity that  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being realized in the reinsurance industry 
if any of these factors were to result in a decline in the demand for reinsurance or an overall increase in reinsurance capacity  our profitability could be impacted 
in recent years  we have experienced a generally softening market cycle  with increased competition  surplus underwriting capacity  deteriorating rates and less favorable terms and conditions all having an impact on our ability to write business 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive and we compete with a number of worldwide reinsurance companies  including  but not limited to  munich re  swiss re  everest re  hannover re  scor and reinsurance operations of certain primary insurance companies  such as ace  arch capital  axis capital  xl group and zurich insurance group 
competition in the types of reinsurance that we underwrite is based on many factors  including the perceived financial strength of the reinsurer  pricing  terms and conditions offered  services provided  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payment and experience in the lines of reinsurance to be written 
if competitive pressures reduce our prices  we would expect to write less business 
in addition  competition for customers would become more intense and we could incur additional expenses relating to customer acquisition and retention  further reducing our operating margins 
further  insurance linked securities and derivative and other non traditional risk transfer mechanisms and vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties  which could impact the demand for traditional insurance or reinsurance 
a number of new  proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in our industry 
new competition from these developments could cause the demand for insurance or reinsurance to fall or the expense of customer acquisition and retention to increase  either of which could have a material adverse affect on our growth and profitability 
legal and regulatory risks political  regulatory  governmental and industry initiatives could adversely affect our business 
our reinsurance operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental and non governmental self regulatory authorities and associations in each of their respective jurisdictions and internationally 
as a result of the current financial crisis  some of these authorities regularly consider enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise assure the stability of institutions under their supervision 
these authorities may also seek to exercise their supervisory authority in new and more robust ways  and new regulators could become authorized to oversee parts of our business 
for example  the european union s solvency ii initiative and the naic s solvency modernization initiative include meaningful changes in consolidated supervision and corporate governance requirements as they apply to insurance and reinsurance corporate groups  which could lead to increases in regulatory capital requirements  reduced operational flexibility and increased compliance costs 
we cannot predict what regulations will finally be adopted 
in addition  in the international association of insurance supervisors iais introduced a concept paper promoting a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups iaigs 
through the common framework  now in its development phase  the iais aims to i develop methods of operating group wide supervision of iaigs  ii establish a comprehensive framework for supervisors to address group wide activities and risks and also set grounds for better supervisory cooperation  and iii foster global convergence of regulatory and supervisory measures and approaches 
it is not possible to predict all future impacts of these types of changes but they could affect the way we conduct our business and manage our capital  and may require us to satisfy increased capital requirements  any of which  in turn  could affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our material subsidiaries regulatory environments are described in detail under the heading business regulation 
regulations relating to each of our material subsidiaries may in effect restrict each of those subsidiaries ability to write new business  to make certain investments and to distribute funds or assets to us 
recent government intervention and the possibility of future government intervention have created uncertainty in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of others  including shareholders of reinsurers 
in light of the current financial crisis  we believe it is likely there will be increased regulation of  and other forms of government participation in  our industry in the future  which could adversely affect our business by  among other things providing reinsurance capacity in markets and to clients that we target or requiring our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations  
table of contents further restricting our operational or capital flexibility  expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies  regulating the terms of reinsurance policies  or disproportionately benefiting the companies domiciled in one country over those domiciled in another 
such a us federal initiative was put forward in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets resulting from  among other things  the september th tragedy  and consequently the terrorism risk insurance act of tria was enacted to ensure the availability of commercial insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in the us in december  the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act tripra was enacted  which further renewed tria for another years ending december  such a state initiative in the us was put forward by the florida legislature in response to the tightening of supply in certain insurance and reinsurance markets in florida resulting from  among other things  hurricane damage in florida  which enacted the hurricane preparedness and insurance act to ensure the availability of catastrophe insurance coverage for catastrophes in the state of florida 
more recent legislative proposals would limit the reinsurance coverage available from the florida hurricane catastrophe fund and limit exposure to assessments from the state run citizens property insurance company 
the insurance industry is also affected by political  judicial and legal developments that may create new and expanded theories of liability  which may result in unexpected claim frequency and severity and delays or cancellations of products and services we provide  which could adversely affect our business 
we are unable to predict the effect that governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will have on such markets generally or on the company in particular 
in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  the us federal government  the european central bank and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the governance of those industries that are viewed as presenting a systemic risk to economic stability 
such actions include the international monetary fund s proposal to levy a financial stability tax on all financial institutions  the proposals for enhanced regulation and supervision contained in the most recently published organization for economic co operation and development paper on the impact of the financial crisis on the insurance sector and the financial regulatory reform provisions contained within the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of we are unable to predict the effect that the enactment of any such proposals will have on the financial markets generally or on the company s competitive position  business and financial condition in particular  though we are monitoring these and similar proposals as they evolve 
the dodd frank act may adversely impact our business 
the us congress and the current administration have made  or called for consideration of  several additional proposals relating to a variety of issues with respect to financial regulation reform  including regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  the establishment of a single state system of licensure for us and foreign reinsurers  further regulation of executive compensation and others 
one of those initiatives  the dodd frank act  was signed into law by the president of the us on july  the dodd frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the us and establishes a federal insurance office under the us treasury department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry 
the director of the federal insurance office will have the ability to recommend that an insurance company or an insurance holding company be subject to heightened prudential standards 
compliance with these new laws and regulations may result in additional costs which may adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
however  at this time  it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty whether any other proposed legislation  rules or regulatory changes will be adopted or what impact  if any  the dodd frank act or any other such legislation  rules or changes could have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents solvency ii could adversely impact our financial results and operations 
solvency ii  a european union directive concerning the capital adequacy  risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers  was adopted by the european parliament and the european council in april of and may adversely affect our reinsurance businesses 
the implementation of solvency ii by the european commission will replace current solvency requirements and is scheduled to take effect january   although it is widely acknowledged that portions of the requirements will be deferred until solvency ii adopts a risk based approach to insurance regulation 
its principal goals are to improve the correlation between capital and risk  effect group supervision of insurance and reinsurance affiliates  implement a uniform capital adequacy structure for insurers across the european union member states  establish consistent corporate governance standards for insurance and reinsurance companies  and establish transparency through standard reporting of insurance operations 
implementation of solvency ii will require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance  the measures implementing solvency ii have not been finalized and may be subject to change  consequently  our implementation plans  which are based on our current understanding of the solvency ii requirements  may need to change 
the current uncertainty as to timing and requirements may add to the cost of compliance 
in addition  the european union is in the process of considering the solvency ii equivalence of bermuda s insurance regulatory and supervisory regime 
the european union equivalence assessment considers whether bermuda s regulatory regime provides a similar level of policyholder protection as provided under solvency ii 
a finding that bermuda s insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent to the european union s solvency ii could have an adverse effect on the cost of partnerre bermuda s european business due to the potential of having to post collateral 
it would not affect partnerre europe s ability to operate in europe 
such a finding could also have adverse indirect commercial impacts on our operations 
an interim assessment has determined that the bermuda regime applicable to class a  b and companies is equivalent with certain caveats  but a final determination is yet to be made 
we are monitoring the ongoing legislative and regulatory steps associated with the adoption of solvency ii 
the principles  standards and requirements of solvency ii may also  directly or indirectly  impact the future supervision of additional operating subsidiaries of ours 
legislative and regulatory activity in health care and other employee benefits could increase the costs or administrative burdens of providing benefits to our employees or hinder or prevent us from attracting and retaining employees  or affect our profitability as a provider of accident and health insurance benefit products 
we derive revenues from the provision of accident and health premiums in the us  that is  providing insurance to institutions that participate in the us healthcare delivery infrastructure 
changes in us healthcare legislation  specifically the patient protection and affordable care act of the healthcare act  have made significant changes to the regulation of health insurance and may affect negatively affect our healthcare liability business including  but not limited to  the healthcare delivery system and the healthcare cost reimbursement structure in the us in addition  the company may be subject to regulations  guidance or determinations emanating from the various regulatory authorities authorized under the healthcare act 
it is difficult to predict the effect that the healthcare act  or any regulatory pronouncement made thereunder  will have on its results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  future healthcare proposals could include tort reform provisions under which plaintiffs would be restricted in their ability to bring suit against healthcare providers  which could negatively impact the demand for our healthcare liability products 
any material changes in how healthcare providers insure their malpractice liability risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
legal and enforcement activities relating to the insurance industry could affect our business and our industry 
the insurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of litigation  investigations and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental and enforcement authorities concerning certain practices within the insurance industry 
these practices include the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance or other non traditional or loss mitigation insurance and reinsurance products 

table of contents these investigations have resulted in changes in the insurance and reinsurance markets and industry business practices 
while at this time  none of these changes have caused an adverse effect on our business  we are unable to predict the potential effects  if any  that future investigations may have upon our industry 
emerging claim and coverage issues could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated developments in the law  as well as changes in social and environmental conditions could potentially result in unexpected claims for coverage under our insurance  reinsurance and other contracts 
these developments and changes may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
with respect to our casualty businesses  these legal  social and environmental changes may not become apparent until sometime after their occurrence 
our exposure to these uncertainties could be exacerbated by an increase in insurance and reinsurance contract disputes  arbitration and litigation 
the full effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict 
as a result  the full extent of our liability under our coverages  and in particular  our casualty reinsurance contracts  may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 
the insurance industry is also affected by political  judicial and legal developments that may create new and expanded theories of liability  which may result in unexpected claim frequency and severity and delays or cancellations of products and services we provide  which could adversely affect our business 
investors may encounter difficulties in service of process and enforcement of judgments against us in the united states 
we are a bermuda company and some of our directors and officers are residents of various jurisdictions outside the us all  or a substantial portion  of the assets of our officers and directors and of our assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the us although we have appointed an agent and irrevocably agreed that the agent may be served with process in new york with respect to actions against us arising out of violations of the us federal securities laws in any federal or state court in the us  it could be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the us on our directors and officers who reside outside the us 
it could also be difficult for investors to enforce against us or our directors and officers judgments of a us court predicated upon civil liability provisions of us federal securities laws 
there is no treaty in force between the us and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
as a result  whether a us judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the us court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers  as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules 
a judgment debt from a us court that is final and for a sum certain based on us federal securities laws will not be enforceable in bermuda unless the judgment debtor had submitted to the jurisdiction of the us court  and the issue of submission and jurisdiction is a matter of bermuda law and not us law 
in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues  bermuda courts will not enforce a us federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to public policy 
an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law  the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction  power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity will not be entered by a bermuda court 
certain remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including certain remedies under us federal securities laws  would not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court  as they would be contrary to bermuda public policy 
further  no claim can be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extra jurisdictional effect under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 

table of contents risks related to our common shares and preferred shares we are a holding company  and if our subsidiaries do not make dividend and other payments to us  we may not be able to pay dividends or make payments on our common and preferred shares and other obligations 
we are a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries and other intercompany balances 
we have cash outflows in the form of operating expenses  dividends to both common and preferred shareholders and  from time to time  cash outflows for the repurchase of common shares under our share repurchase program 
we rely primarily on cash dividends and payments from our subsidiaries to meet our cash outflows 
we expect future dividends and other permitted payments from our subsidiaries to be the principal source of funds to pay expenses and dividends 
the payment of dividends by our reinsurance subsidiaries is limited under bermuda and irish laws and certain statutes of various us states in which our us subsidiaries are licensed to transact business 
as of december   there were no significant restrictions on the payment of dividends by the company s subsidiaries that would limit the company s ability to pay common and preferred shareholders dividends and its corporate expenses 
because we are a holding company  our right  and hence the right of our creditors and shareholders  to participate in any distribution of assets of any subsidiary of ours  upon our liquidation or reorganization or otherwise  is subject to the prior claims of policyholders and creditors of these subsidiaries 
provisions in our bye laws may restrict the voting rights of our shares and may restrict the transferability of our shares 
our bye laws generally provide that if any person owns  directly  indirectly or by attribution  more than of the total combined voting power of our shares entitled to vote  the voting rights attached to such shares will be reduced so that such person may not exercise and is not attributed more than of the total combined voting power 
in addition  our board of directors may limit a shareholder s exercise of voting rights where it deems it necessary to do so to avoid non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders 
under our bye laws  subject to waiver by our board of directors  no transfer of our shares is permitted if such transfer would result in a shareholder controlling more than determined by value or by voting power of our outstanding shares 
our bye laws also provide that if our board of directors determines that share ownership by a person may result in i shareholder owning directly  indirectly or by retribution  more than of the total combined voting power of our shares entitled to vote  or ii any non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders  then we have the option  but not the obligation  to require that shareholder to sell to us for fair market value the minimum number of shares held by such person which is necessary so that after such purchase such shareholder will not own more than of the total combined voting power  or is necessary to eliminate the non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences 
we also have the authority under our bye laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be limited pursuant to our bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to timely respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us  we may  in our sole discretion  eliminate or reduce the shareholder s voting rights 
taxation risks if our non us operations become subject to non us income taxation  our net income will decrease 
we believe that we and our non us subsidiaries other than business sourced by partnerre europe through partnerre miami and partnerre connecticut have operated  and will continue to operate  our respective businesses in a manner that will not cause us to be viewed as engaged in a trade or business in the us and  on this basis  we do not expect that either we or our non us subsidiaries will be required to pay us corporate income taxes other than potential withholding taxes on certain types of us source passive income

table of contents there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the us  the irs may contend that either we or our non us subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business in the us if either we or our us subsidiaries are subject to us income tax  our shareholders equity and net income will be reduced by the amount of such taxes  which might be material 
partnerre us corporation and its subsidiaries conduct business in the us  and are subject to us corporate income taxes 
the impact of bermuda s letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has published reports and launched a global initiative among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
bermuda was not listed in the most recent report as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices  to embrace international tax standards for transparency  to exchange information and to eliminate an environment that attracts business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
if proposed us legislation is passed  our us reinsurance subsidiary may be subject to higher us taxation and our net income would decrease 
currently  our us reinsurance subsidiary retrocedes or may retrocede a portion of its us business to our us reinsurance subsidiaries and is generally entitled to deductions for premiums paid for such retrocessions 
proposed legislation has been introduced that if enacted would impose a limitation on such deductions  which could result in increased us tax on this business and decreased net income 
it is not possible to predict whether this or similar legislation may be enacted in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis reflects the consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries for the years ended december   and executive overview the company is a leading global reinsurer  with a broadly diversified and balanced portfolio of traditional reinsurance risks and capital markets risks 
successful risk management is the foundation of the company s value proposition  with diversification of risks at the core of its risk management strategy 
the company s ability to succeed in the risk assumption and management business is dependent on its ability to accurately analyze and quantify risk  to understand volatility and how risks aggregate or correlate  and to establish the appropriate capital requirements and limits for the risks assumed 
all risks  whether they are reinsurance related risks or capital market risks  are managed by the company within an integrated framework of policies and processes to ensure the intelligent and consistent evaluation and valuation of risk  and to ultimately provide an appropriate return to shareholders 
for further discussion of the company s risk management framework  see risk management in item of part i of this report 
the company s economic objective is to manage a portfolio of risks that will generate growth in compound annual diluted book value per share and share equivalents outstanding over a reinsurance cycle 
management assesses this economic objective over the reinsurance cycle  rather than any particular quarterly or annual period  given the company s profitability is significantly affected by the level of large catastrophic losses that it incurs each period 
the company uses a number of metrics to monitor its performance in meeting its economic objective  which are discussed further below under key financial measures 
the following discussion provides an overview of the company s business and trends and commentary regarding the outlook for in each business 
non life reinsurance business  trends and outlook the company generates its non life reinsurance revenue from premiums 
premium rates and terms and conditions vary by line of business depending on market conditions 
pricing cycles are driven by supply of capital in the industry and demand for reinsurance and other risk transfer products 
the reinsurance business is also influenced by several other factors  including variations in interest rates and financial markets  changes in legal  regulatory and judicial environments  loss trends  inflation and general economic conditions 
in its reinsurance portfolio  the company writes all lines of business in virtually all markets worldwide  and differentiates itself through its risk management strategy and its financial strength 
in assuming its clients risks  the company removes the volatility associated with those risks from the client  and then manages those risks and the risk related volatility 
through its broad product and geographic diversification  its execution capabilities and its local presence in most major markets  the company is able to stabilize returns  respond quickly to market needs  and capitalize on business opportunities virtually anywhere in the world 
a key challenge facing the company is to successfully manage risk through all phases of the reinsurance cycle 
the company believes that its long term strategy of closely monitoring the progression of each line of business  being selective in the business that it writes  and maintaining the diversification and balance of its portfolio  will optimize returns over the reinsurance cycle 
individual lines of business and markets have their own unique characteristics and are at different stages of the reinsurance pricing cycle at any given point in time 
management believes it has achieved appropriate portfolio diversification by product  geography  line and type 
table of contents of business  length of tail  and distribution channel 
further  management believes that this diversification  in addition to the financial strength of the company and its strong global franchise  will help to mitigate cyclical declines in underwriting profitability and achieve a more stable return over the reinsurance cycle 
the non life reinsurance market has historically been highly cyclical in nature 
the reinsurance cycle is driven by competition  the amount of capital and capacity in the industry  loss events and investment returns 
the company s long term strategy to generate shareholder value focuses on broad product  asset and geographic diversification of risks 
the cyclicality of the non life reinsurance market is characterized by cycles of growth and decline  known as hard and soft insurance cycles 
since late  the company began to see the emergence of a soft market across most lines of business with general decreases in pricing and profitability 
with the exception of lines and markets impacted by specific catastrophic or large loss events  this trend continued throughout the decade 
in and  the company experienced increases in pricing in certain loss affected lines of business and markets  which were primarily related to the increased catastrophic and large loss activity during in addition  the impact of superstorm sandy in has resulted in rate increases in the loss affected lines of business and markets at the january  renewals 
in lines of business and markets that have not been specifically impacted by any recent large losses  during and for the january  renewals  the terms and conditions continued to be mainly static and soft in most markets  with price deteriorations observed in some markets 
during the january renewals  the company experienced an increase of approximately in renewable non life treaty business  on a constant foreign exchange basis 
the increase in expected premium volume was driven by new business and growth opportunities in all non life sub segments  with the exception of the catastrophe sub segment  where the company experienced a modest decline in the premium volume as a result of slightly declining pricing in some markets that were not loss affected 
the renewal of the us agriculture book remains in process and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of  however  management expects a significant increase in premium in this line compared to the january  renewals due to new business 
life reinsurance business  trends and outlook the company s life segment derives revenues primarily from renewal premiums from existing reinsurance treaties and new premiums from existing or new reinsurance treaties 
the long term profitability of the life segment mainly depends on the volume and amount of death claims incurred and the ability to adequately price the risk the company assumes 
the life reinsurance policies are often in force for the remaining lifetime of the underlying individuals insured  with premiums earned typically over a period of to years 
the volume of the business may be reduced each year by terminations of the underlying treaties related to lapses  voluntary surrenders  death of insureds and recaptures by ceding companies 
while death claims are reasonably predictable over a period of many years  claims become less predictable over shorter periods and can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year 
within the company s life segment  the reinsurance market is differentiated between mortality including disability and longevity products  with mortality being the larger market 
in addition  in december the company acquired presidio  a us specialty accident and health insurance and reinsurance writer 
the acquisition of presidio provides additional specialty risks not previously written by the company 
management believes the existing life business and presidio s business provides the company with diversification benefits and balance to its portfolio as they are generally non correlated to the company s non life business 
currently  presidio principally operates as a managing general underwriter mgu  writing all of its business on behalf of third party insurance companies and earning a fee for producing the business 
the third party insurance companies then cede a portion of the original business written through quota share reinsurance agreements to presidio s reinsurance subsidiary  such that presidio participates in the original premiums and 
table of contents losses incurred related to the business it has produced and ensuring an alignment of interests with the third party insurance companies 
during  the company will obtain the necessary licenses and approvals to write this business directly itself and will transition these relationships from the third party insurance companies 
for the years ended december   and  the company did not write any new life business in the us  however  following the acquisition of presidio on december   the company expects to write accident and health business in the us in future periods 
the acquisition of presidio is expected to result in substantial overall premium growth in the company s life segment in and beyond once the aforementioned transition is complete 
in terms of the company s existing life portfolio  the majority of the premium arises from in force contracts that are written on a continuous basis 
the active january renewals impact a relatively limited portion of the in force premium in the mortality line 
for those treaties that actively renewed  pricing conditions and terms were generally unchanged from the january  renewals 
the expected premium volume from the company s january  renewal  at constant foreign exchange rates  increased due to new short term mortality business 
management expects moderate continued growth in the company s existing life portfolio in  assuming constant foreign exchange rates 
capital markets business  trends and outlook the company generates revenue from its high quality investment portfolio  as well as the investments underlying the funds held directly managed account  through net investment income  including coupon interest on fixed maturities and dividends on equities  and realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments 
for the company s capital markets risks  which include both public and private market investments  diversification of risk is critical to achieving the risk and return objectives of the company 
the company s investment policy distinguishes between liquid  high quality assets that support the company s liabilities  and the more diversified  higher risk asset classes that make up the company s capital funds 
while there will be years where capital markets risks achieve less than the risk free rate of return  or potentially even negative results  the company believes the rewards for assuming these risks in a disciplined and measured way will produce a positive excess return to the company over time 
additionally  since capital markets risks are not fully correlated with the company s reinsurance risks  this increases the overall diversification of the company s total risk portfolio 
the company follows prudent investment guidelines through a strategy that seeks to maximize returns while managing investment risk in line with the company s overall objectives of earnings stability and long term book value growth 
the company allocates its invested assets into two categories liability funds and capital funds 
see the discussion of liability funds and capital funds in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
a key challenge for the company is achieving the right balance between current investment income and total returns that include price appreciation or depreciation in changing market conditions 
the company regularly reviews the allocation of investments to asset classes within its investment portfolio and its funds held directly managed account and allocates investments to those asset classes the company anticipates will outperform in the near future  subject to limits and guidelines 
similarly  the company reduces its exposure to risk asset classes where returns are underperforming 
the company may also lengthen or shorten the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio in anticipation of changes in interest rates  or increase or decrease the amount of credit risk it assumes  depending on credit spreads and anticipated economic conditions 
the company s capital markets and investment operations  including public and private market investments  have experienced volatile market conditions since the middle of while the market conditions remained volatile in  there were some improvements in the worldwide equity markets 
during  the company shortened the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio given historically low interest rates and to limit the impact of a potential rise in interest rates

overview of the results of operations the company measures its performance in several ways 
among the performance measures accepted under us gaap is diluted net income or loss per share  a measure that focuses on the return provided to the company s common shareholders 
diluted net income or loss per share is obtained by dividing net income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding 
net income or loss available to common shareholders is defined as net income or loss less preferred dividends

table of contents key financial measures in addition to the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss  management uses certain key measures to evaluate its financial performance and the overall growth in value generated for the company s common shareholders 
the four key measures that management uses  together with definitions of their calculations  are as follows at december  and and for the years ended december   and december  december  diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding operating earnings loss available to common shareholders in millions of us dollars operating return on beginning diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding combined ratio diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding is calculated using common shareholders equity shareholders equity less the aggregate liquidation value of preferred shares divided by the number of fully diluted common shares and common share equivalents outstanding assuming exercise of all stock based awards and other dilutive securities 
operating earnings or loss available to common shareholders operating earnings or loss is calculated as net income or loss available to common shareholders excluding net realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments  net of tax  net foreign exchange gains or losses  net of tax  and interest in earnings or losses of equity investments  net of tax  where the investee s operations are not insurance or reinsurance related and where the company does not control the investee companies activities  and is calculated after preferred dividends 
the presentation of operating earnings or loss is a non gaap financial measure within the meaning of regulation g see comment on non gaap measures below and is reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure below 
effective january   management redefined its operating earnings or loss calculation  as discussed below 
operating return on beginning diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding operating roe is calculated using operating earnings or loss  as defined above  per diluted common share and common share equivalents outstanding  divided by diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding as of the beginning of the year  as defined above 
the presentation of operating roe is a non gaap financial measure within the meaning of regulation g see comment on non gaap measures below and is reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure below 
effective january   management redefined its operating roe calculation  as discussed below 
the combined ratio of the non life segment is calculated as the sum of the technical ratio losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned and the other operating expense ratio other operating expenses divided by net premiums earned 
effective january   management redefined its operating earnings or loss available to common shareholders operating earnings or loss calculation to additionally exclude net foreign exchange gains or losses 
management believes that net foreign exchange gains or losses are not indicative of the performance of  and distort trends in  the company s business as they predominantly result from general economic and foreign exchange market conditions 
in addition  management redefined its annualized operating return on beginning diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding operating roe  previously referred to as operating return on beginning common shareholders equity calculation to measure operating roe on a diluted per share basis 
management believes that the redefined operating roe incorporates capital 
table of contents management activities whilst still being based on the concept of deploying available capital on an annual basis 
operating earnings or loss and operating roe for the year ended december  have been recast to reflect the company s redefined non gaap measures 
diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding diluted book value per share management uses compound annual growth rate in diluted book value per share as a key measure of the value the company is generating for its common shareholders  as management believes that growth in the company s diluted book value per share ultimately translates into growth in the company s share price 
diluted book value per share is impacted by the company s net income or loss  capital resources management and external factors such as foreign exchange  interest rates  credit spreads and equity markets  which can drive changes in realized and unrealized gains or losses on its investment portfolio 
over the past five years  since december   the company has generated a compound annual growth rate in diluted book value per share in excess of and over the past ten years  since december   the company has generated a compound annual growth rate in diluted book value per share in excess of 
during  the company s diluted book value per share increased by to at december  from at december  primarily due to comprehensive income of  million and the accretive impact of share repurchases 
the comprehensive income was mainly driven by net income of  million in  which is described in review of net income loss below 
operating earnings or loss available to common shareholders operating earnings or loss management uses operating earnings or loss to measure its financial performance as this measure focuses on the underlying fundamentals of the company s operations by excluding net realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments  certain interest in earnings or losses of equity investments and net foreign exchange gains or losses 
net realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments in any particular period are not indicative of the performance of  and distort trends in  the company s business as they predominantly result from general economic and financial market conditions  and the timing of realized gains or losses on investments is largely opportunistic 
interest in earnings or losses of equity investments are also not indicative of the performance of  or trends in  the company s business where the investee s operations are not insurance or reinsurance related and where the company does not control the investee companies activities 
net foreign exchange gains or losses are not indicative of the performance of  and distort trends in  the company s business as they predominantly result from general economic and foreign exchange market conditions 
management believes that the use of operating earnings or loss enables investors and other users of the company s financial information to analyze its performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance 
management also believes that this measure follows industry practice and  therefore  allows the users of financial information to compare the company s performance with its industry peer group  and that the equity analysts and certain rating agencies which follow the company  and the insurance industry as a whole  generally exclude these items from their analyses for the same reasons 
operating earnings increased by  million  from a loss of million in to an income of million in primarily due to an increase in the non life underwriting result of  million  partially offset by an increase in income tax expense on the higher level of operating earnings 
operating earnings decreased by  million  from million in to a loss of million in mainly due to a decrease in the non life underwriting result of  million  which was driven primarily by the large catastrophic events  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in net investment income of million 
these decreases were partially offset by lower corporate operating expenses of million and an increase in the life underwriting result of million 
the other lesser factors contributing to the increases or decreases in operating earnings in compared to and in compared to are further described in review of net income loss below 

table of contents the presentation of operating earnings or loss available to common shareholders is a non gaap financial measure within the meaning of regulation g and should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap see comment on non gaap measures 
the table below provides a reconciliation of operating earnings or loss to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for the years ended december   and in millions of us dollars net income loss less net realized and unrealized investment gains  net of tax net foreign exchange gains  net of tax interest in earnings losses of equity investments  net of tax dividends to preferred shareholders operating earnings loss available to common shareholders operating roe management uses operating roe as a measure of profitability that focuses on the return to common shareholders 
to support the company s growth objectives  most economic decisions  including capital attribution and underwriting pricing decisions  incorporate an operating roe impact analysis 
for the purpose of that analysis  an appropriate amount of capital equity is attributed to each transaction for determining the transaction s priced return on attributed capital 
subject to an adequate return for the risk level as well as other factors  such as the contribution of each risk to the overall risk level and risk diversification  capital is attributed to the transactions generating the highest priced return on deployed capital 
management s challenge consists of i attributing an appropriate amount of capital to each transaction based on the risk created by the transaction  ii properly estimating the company s overall risk level and the impact of each transaction on the overall risk level  iii assessing the diversification benefit  if any  of each transaction  and iv deploying available capital 
the risk for the company lies in mis estimating any one of these factors  which are critical in calculating a meaningful priced return on deployed capital  and entering into transactions that do not contribute to the company s growth objectives 
operating roe increased from a loss of in to an income of in the increase in operating roe was primarily due to the increase in operating earnings in compared to  which was driven by the lower level of catastrophic loss activity 
the factors contributing to increases or decreases in operating earnings are described further in review of net income loss below 
operating roe decreased from in to a loss of in the decrease in operating roe was primarily due to the decrease in operating earnings in compared to  which was driven by the higher level of catastrophic loss activity 
the average operating roe for the last five years and ten years was and  respectively 
both the five year and the ten year averages primarily reflect some years that were impacted by significant catastrophic losses and other years that were not impacted by catastrophes 
due to the volatility related to the level of catastrophic losses incurred  management believes that it is more appropriate to measure performance based on an average operating roe target over the reinsurance cycle rather than focusing on the results for single periods 

table of contents the presentation of operating roe is a non gaap financial measure within the meaning of regulation g and should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap see comment on non gaap measures

a combined ratio under indicates underwriting profitability  as the total losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and other operating expenses are less than the premiums earned on that business 
while an important metric of underwriting profitability  the combined ratio does not reflect all components of profitability  as it does not recognize the impact of investment income earned on premiums between the time premiums are received and the time loss payments are ultimately made to clients 
the key challenges in managing the combined ratio metric consist of i focusing on underwriting profitable business even in the weaker part of the reinsurance cycle  as opposed to growing the book of business at the cost of profitability  ii diversifying the portfolio to achieve a good balance of business  with the expectation that underwriting losses in certain lines or markets may potentially be offset by underwriting profits in other lines or markets  and iii maintaining control over expenses 
since  the company has had eight years of underwriting profitability reflected in combined ratios of less than for its non life segment  with the only exceptions being and in  when the industry recorded its worst year in history in terms of catastrophe losses in the us  with hurricane katrina being the largest insured event ever  the company recorded a net underwriting loss and non life combined ratio of

the other lesser factors contributing to increases or decreases in the combined ratio for all years presented are described further in review of net income loss below 
the company uses the combined ratio to measure its overall underwriting profitability for its non life segment as a whole 
given the company does not allocate operating expenses to its non life sub segments  management measures the underwriting profitability of the non life sub segments by using the technical result and technical ratio as described in results by segment below 

table of contents comment on non gaap measures throughout this filing  the company s results of operations have been presented in the way that management believes will be the most meaningful and useful to investors  analysts  rating agencies and others who use financial information in evaluating the performance of the company 
this presentation includes the use of operating earnings or loss and operating roe that are not calculated under standards or rules that comprise us gaap 
these measures are referred to as non gaap financial measures within the meaning of regulation g 
management believes that these non gaap financial measures are important to investors  analysts  rating agencies and others who use the company s financial information and will help provide a consistent basis for comparison between years and for comparison with the company s peer group  although non gaap measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies 
investors should consider these non gaap measures in addition to  and not as a substitute for  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures  net income or loss and return on beginning common shareholders equity calculated with net income or loss available to common shareholders  is presented above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following presents a discussion of those accounting policies and estimates that management believes are the most critical to its operations and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgment 
if actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions and estimates used by management  there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
these critical accounting policies and estimates should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements  including note  significant accounting policies  for a full understanding of the company s accounting policies 
the sensitivity estimates that follow are based on outcomes that the company considers reasonably likely to occur 
losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits losses and loss expenses because a significant amount of time can elapse between the assumption of risk  occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance company the primary company or the cedant  the subsequent reporting to the reinsurance company the reinsurer and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event by the reinsurer  the company s liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses loss reserves is based largely upon estimates 
the company categorizes loss reserves into three types of reserves reported outstanding loss reserves case reserves  additional case reserves acrs and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
the company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a quarterly basis using information received from its cedants 
case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the company s cedants and recorded by the company 
acrs are established for particular circumstances where  on the basis of individual loss reports  the company estimates that the particular loss or collection of losses covered by a treaty may be greater than those advised by the cedant 
ibnr reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company  as well as future loss development on losses already reported  in excess of the case reserves and acrs 
unlike case reserves and acrs  ibnr reserves are often calculated at an aggregated level and cannot usually be directly identified as reserves for a particular loss or treaty 
the company also estimates the future unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae associated with the loss reserves and these form part of the company s loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company s non life loss reserves for each category  line and sub segment are reported in the tables included later in this section 

table of contents the amount of time that elapses before a claim is reported to the cedant and then subsequently reported to the reinsurer is commonly referred to in the industry as the reporting tail 
lines of business for which claims are reported quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines  and lines of business for which a longer period of time elapses before claims are reported to the reinsurer are commonly referred to as long tail lines 
in general  for reinsurance  the time lags are longer than for primary business due to the delay that occurs between the cedant becoming aware of a loss and reporting the information to its reinsurer s 
the delay varies by reinsurance market country of cedant  type of treaty  whether losses are first paid by the cedant and the size of the loss 
the delay could vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer 
the company considers agriculture  catastrophe  energy  property  motor business written in the us  proportional motor business written outside of the us  specialty property and structured risk to be short tail lines  aviation space  credit surety  engineering  marine and multiline to be medium tail lines  and casualty  non proportional motor business written outside of the us and specialty casualty to be long tail lines of business 
for all lines  the company s objective is to estimate ultimate losses and loss expenses 
total loss reserves are then calculated by subtracting losses paid 
similarly  ibnr reserves are calculated by subtraction of case reserves and acrs from total loss reserves 
the company analyzes its ultimate losses and loss expenses after consideration of the loss experience of various reserving cells 
the company assigns treaties to reserving cells and allocates losses from the treaty to the reserving cell 
the reserving cells are selected in order to ensure that the underlying treaties have homogeneous loss development characteristics eg  reporting tail but are large enough to make estimation of trends credible 
the selection of reserving cells is reviewed annually and changes over time as the business of the company evolves 
for each reserving cell  the company tabulates losses in reserving triangles that show the total reported or paid claims at each financial year end by underwriting year cohort 
an underwriting year is the year during which the reinsurance treaty was entered into as opposed to the year in which the loss occurred accident year  or the calendar year for which financial results are reported 
for each reserving cell  the company s estimates of loss reserves are reached after a review of the results of several commonly accepted actuarial projection methodologies 
in selecting its best estimate  the company considers the appropriateness of each methodology to the individual circumstances of the reserving cell and underwriting year for which the projection is made 
the methodologies that the company employs include  but may not be limited to  paid and reported chain ladder methods  expected loss ratio method  paid and reported bornhuetter ferguson b f methods  and paid and reported benktander methods 
in addition  the company uses other methodologies to estimate liabilities for specific types of claims 
for example  internal and vendor catastrophe models are typically used in the estimation of loss and loss expenses at the early stages of catastrophe losses before loss information is reported to the reinsurer 
in the case of asbestos and environmental claims  the company has established reserves for future losses and allocated loss expenses based on the results of periodic actuarial studies  which consider the underlying exposures of the company s cedants 
the reserve methodologies employed by the company are dependent on data that the company collects 
this data consists primarily of loss amounts and loss payments reported by the company s cedants  and premiums written and earned reported by cedants or estimated by the company 
the actuarial methods used by the company to project loss reserves that it will pay in the future future liabilities do not generally include methodologies that are dependent on claim counts reported  claim counts settled or claim counts open as  due to the nature of the company s business  this information is not routinely provided by cedants for every treaty 
a brief description of the reserving methods commonly employed by the company and a discussion of their particular advantages and disadvantages follows chain ladder cl development methods reported or paid these methods use the underlying assumption that losses reported paid for each underwriting year at a particular development stage follow a stable pattern 
for example  the cl development method assumes that on average  every underwriting year will display the same percentage of ultimate liabilities reported by the company s cedants say x at months after the inception of the underwriting year 
the percentages reported paid are established for each development stage eg  at months  months  etc 
after examining historical 
table of contents averages from the loss development data 
these are sometimes supplemented by external benchmark information 
ultimate liabilities are estimated by multiplying the actual reported paid losses by the reciprocal of the assumed reported paid percentage eg  x 
reserves are then calculated by subtracting paid claims from the estimated ultimate liabilities 
the main strengths of the method are that it is reactive to loss emergence payments and that it makes full use of historical experience on claim emergence payments 
for homogeneous low volatility lines  under stable economic conditions the method can often produce good estimates of ultimate liabilities and reserves 
however  the method has weaknesses when the underlying assumption of stable patterns is not true 
this may be the consequence of changes in the mix of business  changes in claim inflation trends  changes in claim reporting practices or the presence of large claims  among other things 
furthermore  the method tends to produce volatile estimates of ultimate liabilities in situations where there is volatility in reported paid patterns 
in particular  when the expected percentage reported paid is low  small deviations between actual and expected claims can lead to very volatile estimates of ultimate liabilities and reserves 
consequently  this method is often unsuitable for projections at early development stages of an underwriting year 
finally  the method fails to incorporate any information regarding market conditions  pricing  etc  which could improve the estimate of liabilities and reserves 
it therefore tends not to perform very well in situations where there are rapidly changing market conditions 
expected loss ratio elr method this method estimates ultimate losses for an underwriting year by applying an estimated loss ratio to the earned premium for that underwriting year 
although the method is insensitive to actual reported or paid losses  it can often be useful at the early stages of development when very few losses have been reported or paid  and the principal sources of information available to the company consist of information obtained during pricing and qualitative information supplied by the cedant 
however  the lack of sensitivity to reported or paid losses means that the method is usually inappropriate at later stages of development 
bornhuetter ferguson b f methods reported or paid these methods aim to address the concerns of the chain ladder development methods  which are the variability at early stages of development and the failure to incorporate external information such as pricing 
however  the b f methods are more sensitive to reported and paid losses than the expected loss ratio method  and can be seen as a blend of the expected loss ratio and chain ladder development methods 
unreported unpaid claims are calculated using an expected reporting payment pattern and an externally determined estimate of ultimate liabilities usually determined by multiplying an a priori loss ratio with estimates of premium volume 
the accuracy of the a priori loss ratio is a critical assumption in this method 
usually a priori loss ratios are initially determined on the basis of pricing information  but may also be adjusted to reflect other information that subsequently emerges about underlying loss experience 
although the method tends to provide less volatile indications at early stages of development and reflects changes in the external environment  this method can be slow to react to emerging loss development payment 
in particular  to the extent that the a priori loss ratios prove to be inaccurate and are not revised  the b f methods will produce loss estimates that take longer to converge with the final settlement value of loss liabilities 
benktander b k methods reported or paid these methods can be viewed as a blend between the chain ladder development and the b f methods described above 
the blend is based on predetermined weights at each development stage that depend on the reported paid development patterns 
although mitigated to some extent  this method still exhibits the same advantages and disadvantages as the b f method  but the mechanics of the calculation imply that it is more reactive to loss emergence payment than the b f method 

table of contents method weights in determining the loss reserves  the company often relies on a blend of the results from two or more methods eg  weighted averages 
the judgment as to which of the above method s is most appropriate for a particular underwriting year and reserving cell could change over time as new information emerges regarding underlying loss activity and other data issues 
furthermore  as each line is typically composed of several reserving cells  it is likely that the reserves for the line will be dependent on several reserving methods 
this is because reserves for a line are the result of aggregating the reserves for each constituent reserving cell and that a different method could be selected for each reserving cell 
although it is not appropriate to refer to reserves for a line as being determined by a particular method  the table below summarizes the methods that were given principal weight in selecting the best estimates of reserves in each reserving line and can therefore be viewed as key drivers of selected reserves 
the table distinguishes methods for mature and immature underwriting years  as they are often different 
the definition of maturity is specific to a line and is related to the reporting tail 
if at the reserve evaluation date  a significant proportion of losses for the underwriting year are expected to have been reported  then the underwriting year is deemed to be mature  otherwise it is deemed to be immature 
for short tail lines  such as property or agriculture  immature years can refer to the one or two most recent underwriting years  while for longer tail lines  such as casualty  immature years can refer to the three or four most recent underwriting years 
to the extent that the principal reserving methods used for major components of a reserving line are different  these are separately identified in the table below 
the table below identifies reserving lines for the company s non life sub segments  which are defined in results by segment below

table of contents the reserving methods used by the company are dependent on a number of key parameter assumptions 
the principal parameter assumptions underlying the methods used by the company are i the loss development factors used to form an expectation of the evolution of reported and paid claims for several years following the inception of the underwriting year 
these are often derived by examining the company s data after due consideration of the underlying factors listed below 
in some cases  where the company lacks sufficient volume to have statistical credibility  external benchmarks are used to supplement the company s data  ii the tail factors used to reflect development of paid and reported losses after several years have elapsed since the inception of the underwriting year  iii the a priori loss ratios used as inputs in the b f methods  and iv the selected loss ratios used as inputs in the expected loss ratio method 
the validity of all parameter assumptions used in the reserving process is reaffirmed on a quarterly basis 
reaffirmation of the parameter assumptions means that the actuaries determine that the parameter assumptions continue to form a sound basis for projection of future liabilities 
parameter assumptions used in projecting future liabilities are themselves estimates based on historical information 
as new information becomes available eg  additional losses reported  the company s actuaries determine whether a revised estimate of the parameter assumptions that reflects all available information is consistent with the previous parameter assumptions employed 
in general  to the extent that the revised estimate of the parameter assumptions are within a close range of the original assumptions  the company determines that the parameter assumptions employed continue to form an appropriate basis for projections and continue to use the original assumptions in its models 
in this case  any differences could be attributed to the imprecise nature of the parameter estimation process 
however  to the extent that the deviations between the two sets of estimates are not within a close range of the original assumptions  the company reacts by adopting the revised assumptions as a basis for its reserve models 
notwithstanding the above  even where the company has experienced no material deviations from its original assumptions during any quarter  the company will generally revise the reserving parameter assumptions at least once a year to reflect all accumulated available information 
in addition to examining the data  the selection of the parameter assumptions is dependent on several underlying factors 
the company s actuaries review these underlying factors and determine the extent to which these are likely to be stable over the time frame during which losses are projected  and the extent to which these factors are consistent with the company s data 
if these factors are determined to be stable and consistent with the data  the estimation of the reserving parameter assumptions are mainly carried out using actuarial and statistical techniques applied to the company s data 
to the extent that the actuaries determine that they cannot continue to rely on the stability of these factors  the statistical estimates of parameter assumptions are modified to reflect the direction of the change 
the main underlying factors upon which the estimates of reserving parameters are predicated are i the cedant s business practices will proceed as in the past with no material changes either in submission of accounts or cash flows  ii any internal delays in processing accounts received by the cedant are not materially different from that experienced historically  and hence the implicit reserving allowance made in loss reserves through the methods continues to be appropriate  iii case reserve reporting practices  particularly the methodologies used to establish and report case reserves  are unchanged from historical practices  iv the company s internal claim practices  particularly the level and extent of use of acrs are unchanged  v historical levels of claim inflation can be projected into the future and will have no material effect on either the acceleration or deceleration of claim reporting and payment patterns  
table of contents vi the selection of reserving cells results in homogeneous and credible future expectations for all business in the cell and any changes in underlying treaty terms are either reflected in cell selection or explicitly allowed in the selection of trends  vii in cases where benchmarks are used  they are derived from the experience of similar business  and viii the company can form a credible initial expectation of the ultimate loss ratio of recent underwriting years through a review of pricing information  supplemented by qualitative information on market events 
the company s best estimate of total loss reserves is typically in excess of the midpoint of the actuarial ultimate liability estimate 
the company believes that there is potentially significant risk in estimating loss reserves for long tail lines of business and for immature underwriting years that may not be adequately captured through traditional actuarial projection methodologies as these methodologies usually rely heavily on projections of prior year trends into the future 
in selecting its best estimate of future liabilities  the company considers both the results of actuarial point estimates of loss reserves as well as the potential variability of these estimates as captured by a reasonable range of actuarial liability estimates 
the selected best estimates of reserves are always within the reasonable range of estimates indicated by the company s actuaries 
in determining the appropriate best estimate  the company reviews i the position of overall reserves within the actuarial reserve range  ii the result of bottom up analysis by underwriting year reflecting the impact of parameter uncertainty in actuarial calculations  and iii specific qualitative information on events that may have an effect on future claims but which may not have been adequately reflected in actuarial estimates  such as potential for outstanding litigation  claims practices of cedants  etc 
during  and  the company reviewed its estimate for prior year losses for the non life segment defined below in results by segment and  in light of developing data  adjusted its ultimate loss ratios for prior accident years

based on the company s assessment of this loss information  the company decreased increased for motor non us proportional business and engineering its expected ultimate loss ratios  which had the net effect of decreasing increasing for motor non us proportional business and engineering prior year loss estimates 
the following paragraphs discuss how losses paid and reported during the year ended december  compared with the company s expectations  and how the company modified its reserving parameter assumptions in line with the emerging development in each reserving line 
agriculture aggregate losses reported in for north america business related to the underwriting year were below the company s expectations 
in addition  the company s global non us business experienced lower than expected reported losses 
the company lowered its loss ratios  however  it did not otherwise materially alter its reserving assumptions 
aviation space aggregate losses reported in were significantly lower than the company s expectations 
the company reflected this experience by selecting lower loss ratios for underwriting years to casualty specialty casualty aggregate losses reported in for north america business were below the company s expectations as losses for all underwriting years for and prior continue to emerge at levels significantly below expectations 
for global non us lines  aggregate losses reported in were below the company s expectations for underwriting years to for both global non us p c and global non us specialty sub segments 
the company reflected this experience by reducing the loss ratios as well as by changing the initial expected loss ratios 

table of contents catastrophe reserves established for the catastrophe line are primarily a function of the presence or absence of catastrophic events during the year  and the complexity and uncertainty associated with estimating unpaid losses from these large disclosed events 
in addition  reserves are established in consideration of mid sized and attritional loss events that occur during a year 
the company has not significantly changed its loss estimates for the japan earthquake and the and the february and june new zealand earthquakes  however  it has reflected reserve releases related to other prior years loss events and lower than expected emergence of attritional losses 
credit surety aggregate losses reported in were lower than expected for north america business  giving rise to a moderate level of reserve releases 
for the company s global non us business  loss development was significantly better than expected  primarily for the underwriting years to the company reduced its loss ratios for the most recent underwriting years to reflect the lower than expected loss emergence 
energy onshore aggregate losses reported in were lower than expected across most underwriting years  with the exception of which was impacted by higher than expected losses on proportional treaties 
the company has reflected the favorable development by reducing its loss ratios for most underwriting years  with the exception of engineering aggregate losses reported in were higher than expected and were primarily driven by increases in prior year premium adjustments for various underwriting years on proportional business reflecting increased exposure 
the company did not materially change its reserving assumptions for this line 
marine energy offshore aggregate losses reported in were significantly lower than expected and impacted most underwriting years 
the company reduced its loss ratios for underwriting years to to reflect the lower than expected loss emergence 
motor aggregate losses reported in for the global non us motor non proportional line were lower than expected resulting in the company reducing its loss ratios 
the company also increased its weightings to more experience based indications resulting in further prior year releases on underwriting years to aggregate losses reported in for the global non us motor proportional line were in line with expectations  however  the company has increased its loss development factor assumptions slightly during the year due to adverse development reported on certain treaties 
aggregate losses reported in for the north america motor line were modestly favorable 
this reflected lower than expected reported losses for the to underwriting years  while the underwriting year experienced adverse development driven by higher than expected reported losses 
multiline aggregate reported losses in were lower than expected for north america business for underwriting years and prior and were partly offset by higher than expected losses reported for the underwriting year 
property specialty property aggregate reported losses in were lower than expected for north america business and were driven by loss activity related to large property events and attritional property losses from most underwriting years 
aggregate losses reported in in the global non us property lines were lower than expected for most underwriting years 
the company reflected this experience by reducing its loss ratios for most underwriting years 

table of contents as an example of the sensitivity of the company s reserves to reserving parameter assumptions  the tables below summarize  by reserving line  the effect on the company s reserves of higher lower a priori loss ratio selections  higher lower loss development factors and higher lower tail factors 
the company believes that the illustrated sensitivities to the reserving parameter assumptions are indicative of the potential variability inherent in the estimation process of those parameters 
reserving lines selected assumptions higher a priori loss ratios higher loss development factors higher tail factors lower a priori loss ratios lower loss development factors lower tail factors agriculture points months points months aviation space casualty specialty casualty catastrophe credit surety energy onshore engineering marine energy offshore motor non us non proportional business motor non us proportional business motor north america business multiline property specialty property reserving lines selected sensitivity in millions of us dollars higher a priori loss ratios higher loss development factors higher tail factors lower a priori loss ratios lower loss development factors lower tail factors agriculture aviation space casualty specialty casualty catastrophe credit surety energy onshore engineering marine energy offshore motor non us non proportional business motor non us proportional business motor north america business multiline property specialty property tail factors are defined as aggregate development factors after years from the inception of an underwriting year 
some reserving lines show little sensitivity to a priori loss ratio  loss development factor or tail factor as the company may use reserving methods such as the expected loss ratio method in several of its reserving cells within those lines 
it is not appropriate to sum the total impact for a specific factor or the total impact for a specific reserving line as the lines of business are not perfectly correlated 

table of contents the following table shows the gross reserves reported by cedants case reserves  those estimated by the company acrs and ibnr reserves and the total gross  ceded and net loss reserves recorded at december  by reserving line for the company s non life operations in millions of us dollars reserving lines case reserves acrs ibnr reserves total gross loss reserves recorded ceded loss reserves total net loss reserves recorded agriculture aviation space casualty specialty casualty catastrophe credit surety energy onshore engineering marine energy offshore motor non us non proportional business motor non us proportional business motor north america business multiline property specialty property other total non life reserves the net loss reserves represent the company s best estimate of future losses and loss expense amounts based on the information available at december  loss reserves rely upon estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections at a given time that reflect the company s expectations of the costs of the ultimate settlement and administration of claims 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events and the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
in the event that the business environment and social trends diverge from historical trends  the company may have to adjust its loss reserves to amounts falling significantly outside its current estimate 
these estimates are continually reviewed and the ultimate liability may be in excess of  or less than  the amounts provided  for which any adjustments will be reflected in the period in which the need for an adjustment is determined 
the company s best estimates are point estimates within a reasonable range of actuarial liability estimates 
these ranges are developed using stochastic simulations and techniques and provide an indication as to the degree of variability of the loss reserves 
the company interprets the ranges produced by these techniques as confidence intervals around the point estimates for each non life sub segment 
however  due to the inherent volatility in the business written by the company  there can be no assurance that the final settlement of the loss reserves will fall within these ranges

see business reserves in item of part i of this report 
a significant amount of judgment was used to estimate the range of potential losses related to the earthquakes that occurred in new zealand in september  february and june the and the february and june new zealand earthquakes and the japan earthquake and there remains a considerable degree of uncertainty related to the range of possible ultimate losses 
these risks and uncertainties include the ongoing cedant revisions of loss estimates for each of these events  the degree to which inflation impacts construction materials required to rebuild affected properties  the characteristics of the company s program participation for certain affected cedants and potentially affected cedants  and the expected length of the claims settlement period for these events 
in addition  there is additional complexity related to the and the february and june new zealand earthquakes given multiple earthquakes have occurred in the same region in a relatively short time period  resulting in cedants continuing to revise their allocation of losses between the various events impacting different treaties  under which the company may provide different amounts of coverage 
loss estimates arising from earthquakes are inherently more uncertain than those from other catastrophic events and the company believes there remains a high degree of uncertainty related to its loss estimates for the and the february and june new zealand earthquakes and the japan earthquake  and the ultimate losses arising from these events may be materially in excess of  or less than  the amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheet at december  based upon information currently available and the estimated range of potential ultimate liabilities  the company believes that unpaid loss and loss expense reserves contemplate a reasonable provision for exposure related to the catastrophic events 
in addition to the sum of the point estimates recorded for each of the catastrophic events  at december  the company recorded additional gross reserves of million net reserves of million after the impact of retrocession  specifically related to the catastrophic events within its catastrophe sub segment 
the additional gross reserves recorded were in consideration of the number of events  the complexity of certain events and the continuing uncertainties in estimating the ultimate losses for these events in the aggregate 
the company continues to evaluate the additional gross reserves that were recorded as part of its periodic reserving process 
at december   the company decided to maintain the 
table of contents additional gross reserves and did not record any changes during the year ended december  given the uncertainties described above remain 
any changes to the amounts recorded will be based on updated or new information and management s assessment of remaining uncertainty related to the specific factors regarding the catastrophic events 
changes to the amounts recorded may either result in i the reallocation of some or all of the additional reserves to one or more of the catastrophic events  or ii the release of some or all of the additional reserves to net income in future periods  or iii an increase in additional reserves recorded 
included in the business that is considered to have a long reporting tail is the company s exposure to asbestos and environmental claims 
the company s net reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december  included million that represents estimates of its net ultimate liability for asbestos and environmental claims 
the gross liability for such claims at december  was million  which primarily relates to paris re s gross liability for asbestos and environmental claims for accident years and prior of million  with any favorable or adverse development being subject to the reserve agreement 
of the remaining million in gross reserves  the majority relates to casualty exposures in the united states arising from business written by partnerre sa and partnerre us 
ultimate loss estimates for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques and there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the company s potential losses for these claims 
in view of the legal and tort environment that affect the development of such claims  the uncertainties inherent in estimating asbestos and environmental claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
there can be no assurance that the reserves established by the company will not be adversely affected by development of other latent exposures  and further  there can be no assurance that the reserves established by the company will be adequate 
the company does  however  actively evaluate potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and establishes additional reserves as appropriate 
the company believes that it has made a reasonable provision for these exposures and is unaware of any specific issues that would materially affect its unpaid losses and loss expense reserves related to this exposure see note to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
life policy benefits policy benefits for life and annuity contracts relate to the business in the company s life segment  which predominantly includes reinsurance of longevity  subdivided into standard and non standard annuities  and mortality business  which includes death and disability covers with various riders primarily written in continental europe  tci primarily written in the uk and ireland  and gmdb business primarily written in continental europe 
effective december   following the acquisition of presidio  the company writes specialty accident and health business  predominantly in the us 
presidio s primary lines of business include hmo reinsurance  medical reinsurance and provider and employer excess of loss programs 
the company categorizes life reserves into three types of reserves reported outstanding loss reserves case reserves  incurred but not reported ibnr reserves and reserves for future policy benefits 
case reserves represent unpaid losses reported by the company s cedants and recorded by the company 
ibnr reserves represent a provision for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company  as well as future loss development on losses already reported  in excess of the case reserves 
reserves for future policy benefits  which relate to future events occurring on policies in force over an extended period of time  are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of future expected premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with us gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of reserves for future policy benefits have been determined based upon information reported by ceding companies  supplemented by the company s actuarial estimates of mortality  critical illness  persistency and future investment income  with appropriate provision to reflect uncertainty 
case reserves  ibnr reserves and reserves for future policy benefits are generally calculated at the treaty level 
the company updates its estimates for each of the aforementioned categories on a periodic basis using information received from its cedants 

table of contents the company s reserving practices begin with the categorization of the contracts written as short duration  long duration  or universal life business for us gaap reserving purposes 
this categorization determines the company s reserving methodology which is described by line of business below 
longevity the reserves for the annuity portfolio of reinsurance contracts within the longevity book are established in accordance with the provisions for long duration insurance contracts under us gaap 
many of these contracts subject the company to risks arising from policyholder mortality over a period that extends beyond the periods in which premiums are collected 
for long duration contracts  the company establishes initial reserves based upon management s best estimate of policy benefits and includes a provision for adverse deviation 
management s best estimate relies upon actuarial indications of future policy benefits 
the provision for adverse deviation contemplates reasonable deviations from the best estimate assumptions for the key risk elements relevant to the product being evaluated  including mortality expenses  and discount rate among others  and are recorded in accordance with us gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
the company s actuaries annually verify the current reserving assumptions in consideration of evolving experience and the actuarial indications for assumptions relating to future policy benefits  including mortality and future investment income  among others 
management makes no adjustments to recorded deferred acquisition costs or future policy benefits if the actuarial indications conclude that current recorded us gaap policy benefits are adequate 
the company establishes a premium deficiency reserve  or an increase to future policy benefits to the extent that deferred acquisition costs are insufficient to cover the premium deficiency reserve  if the actuarial indication of life policy benefits is greater than current recorded aggregate amounts for policy benefits  settlement costs  and deferred acquisition costs 
for standard annuities  the main risk is a faster increase in future life span than expected in the medium to long term 
non standard annuities are annuities sold to people with aggravated health conditions and are usually medically underwritten on an individual basis and the main risk is the inadequate assessment of the future life span of the insured 
mortality the reserves for the short term mortality business are established in accordance with the provisions for short duration insurance contracts under us gaap 
they consist of case reserves and ibnr  calculated at the treaty level based upon cedant information 
the company s reserving methodology includes a quarterly review of actual experience against expected experience and the use of the expected loss ratio method described in losses and loss expenses above 
given the very short term loss development of this portion of the portfolio  this method is considered appropriate 
the reserves for the long term traditional mortality and tci reinsurance portfolio are established in accordance with the provisions for long duration insurance contracts under us gaap and follow the reserving methodology discussed under the longevity section above 
in addition to the assumptions discussed above  persistency and critical illness assumptions are considered in the reserving process for mortality lines 
the reserves for the gmdb reinsurance business are established in accordance with the provisions for universal life contracts under us gaap 
key actuarial assumptions for this business are mortality  lapses  interest rates  expected returns on cash and bonds and stock market performance 
for the last parameter  a stochastic option pricing approach is used and the benefits used in calculating the liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios 
the assumptions of investment performance and volatility are consistent with expected future experience of the respective underlying funds available for policyholder investment options 
recorded reserves for gmdb reflect management s best estimate which relies upon the quarterly actuarial indications 

table of contents accident and health the reserves for accident and health business are established in accordance with the provisions for short duration insurance contracts under us gaap 
reserves are initially calculated using the expected loss ratio method 
subsequently  the company s reserving methodology utilizes actual reported loss experience and the bornhuetter ferguson method to calculate ibnr

reserving lines factors change impact on total life reserves in millions of us dollars longevity non standard annuities life expectancy year standard annuities mortality improvements per annum mortality long term and tci mortality gmdb stock market performance it is not appropriate to sum the total impact for a specific reserving line or the total impact for a specific factor because the reinsurance portfolios are not perfectly correlated 
premiums and acquisition costs the company provides proportional and non proportional reinsurance coverage to cedants insurance companies 
in most cases  cedants seek protection for business that they have not yet written at the time they enter into reinsurance agreements and thus have to estimate the volume of premiums they will cede to the company 
reporting delays are inherent in the reinsurance industry and vary in length by reinsurance market country of cedant and type of treaty 
as delays can vary from a few weeks to a year or sometimes longer  the company produces accounting estimates to report premiums and acquisition costs until it receives the cedants actual premium reported data 
approximately   and of the company s reported net premiums written for the years ended december   and  respectively  were based upon estimates 
under proportional treaties  which represented of the company s total gross premiums written for the year ended december   the company shares proportionally in both the premiums and losses of the cedant and pays the cedant a commission to cover the cedant s acquisition costs 
under this type of treaty  the 
table of contents company s ultimate premiums written and earned and acquisition costs are not known at the inception of the treaty 
as such  reported premiums written and earned and acquisition costs on proportional treaties are generally based upon reports received from cedants and brokers  supplemented by the company s own estimates of premiums written and acquisition costs for which ceding company reports have not been received 
premium and acquisition cost estimates are determined at the individual treaty level 
the determination of premium estimates requires a review of the company s experience with cedants  familiarity with each market  an understanding of the characteristics of each line of business and management s assessment of the impact of various other factors on the volume of business written and ceded to the company 
premium and acquisition cost estimates are updated as new information is received from the cedants and differences between such estimates and actual amounts are recorded in the period in which estimates are changed or the actual amounts are determined 
under non proportional treaties  which represented of the company s total gross premiums written for the year ended december   the company is typically exposed to loss events in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or loss ratio and receives a fixed or minimum premium  which is subject to upward adjustment depending on the premium volume written by the cedant 
in addition  many of the non proportional treaties include reinstatement premium provisions 
reinstatement premiums are recognized as written and earned at the time a loss event occurs  where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre defined contract terms 
the accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on management s estimate of losses and loss expenses associated with the loss event 
the magnitude and impact of changes in premium estimates differs for proportional and non proportional treaties 
although proportional treaties may be subject to larger changes in premium estimates compared to non proportional treaties  as the company generally receives cedant statements in arrears and must estimate all premiums for periods ranging from one month to more than one year depending on the frequency of cedant statements  the pre tax impact is mitigated by changes in the cedant s related reported acquisition costs and losses 
the impact of the change in estimate on premiums earned and pre tax results varies depending on when the change becomes known during the risk period and the underlying profitability of the treaty 
non proportional treaties generally include a fixed minimum premium and an adjustment premium 
while the fixed minimum premiums require no estimation  adjustment premiums are estimated and could be subject to changes in estimates 
the following table shows the amounts recorded within net premiums written and earned that related to changes in prior year premium estimates reported by cedants for each non life sub segment for the year ended december  in millions of us dollars non life sub segment net premiums written net premiums earned north america global non us p c global non us specialty catastrophe total these increases in net premiums written and earned  after the corresponding adjustments to acquisition costs and losses and loss expenses  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated pre tax net income 

table of contents as an example of the sensitivity of the company s non life net premiums written and acquisition costs to changes in estimates  the table below summarizes the effect of different assumption selections on pre tax net income based on amounts recorded for the year ended december  in millions of us dollars change impact on pre tax net income net premiums written non life proportional treaties net premiums written non life non proportional treaties acquisition costs all non life treaties the estimate assumes that the changes in net premiums written become known at the mid point of the risk period and is made by applying the reported technical ratio for the year ended december  the estimate assumes that the changes in net premiums written become known at the mid point of the risk period and also assume there is no change in losses and loss expenses 
the estimate relates to all of the company s non life treaties both proportional and non proportional and assumes that the changes become known at the mid point of the risk period and also assumes there is no change in premium estimates 
acquisition costs  comprising only of incremental brokerage fees  commissions and excise taxes  which vary directly with  and are related to  the acquisition of reinsurance contracts  are capitalized and charged to expense as the related premium is earned 
all other acquisition related costs  including all indirect costs  are expensed as incurred 
the recovery of deferred policy acquisition costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
deferred policy acquisition costs recoverability testing is performed periodically together with the reserve adequacy test  based on the latest best estimate assumptions by line of business 
income taxes under us gaap  a deferred tax asset or liability is to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
us gaap also establishes procedures to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established for deferred tax assets 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a deferred tax asset 
management must use its judgment in considering the relative impact of positive and negative evidence 
the company has also established tax liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions as defined under us gaap of million at december  see notes l and to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
the company has estimated the future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and has a deferred tax asset at december  of million  after a valuation allowance of million 
the most significant components of the deferred tax asset relate to loss reserve discounting for tax purposes and tax loss carryforwards 
the company has projected future taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets arise 
these projections are based on management s projections of premium and investment income  capital gains and losses  and technical and expense ratios 
based on these projections and an analysis of the ability to utilize loss and foreign tax credits carryforwards at the taxable entity level  management evaluates the need for a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance of million  recorded at december   primarily related to a tax loss carryforward in singapore 
in accordance with us gaap  the company has assumed that the future reversal of deferred tax liabilities will result in an increase in taxes payable in future years 
underlying this assumption is an expectation that the company will continue to be subject to taxation in the various tax jurisdictions and that the company will continue to generate taxable revenues in excess of deductions 

table of contents as an example of the sensitivity of the company s unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions  deferred tax asset and net deferred tax liability  the table below summarizes the impact of different assumption selections on the company s net income and the corresponding impact on net assets based on amounts recorded at december  in millions of us dollars change impact on net income and net assets unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions deferred tax asset net deferred tax liability valuation of investments and funds held directly managed  including certain derivative financial instruments the company defines fair value as the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the company measures the fair value of its financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value by maximizing the use of observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company s assumptions about what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the level in the hierarchy within which a given fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement 
the company must determine the appropriate level in the hierarchy for each financial instrument that it measures at fair value 
in determining fair value  the company uses various valuation approaches  including market  income and cost approaches 
see note to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for more detail on the valuation techniques  methods and assumptions that were used by the company to estimate the fair value of its fixed maturities and short term investments  equities  other invested assets and its fixed maturities and other invested assets underlying the funds held directly managed account 
see note to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for more discussion of the company s use of derivative financial instruments 
the company records all of its fixed maturities  short term investments and equities  certain other invested assets  including derivative financial instruments  and its fixed maturities and certain other invested assets underlying the funds held directly managed account at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets 
the changes in fair value of all of the company s investments  carried at fair value  are recorded in net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations and are included in the determination of net income or loss in the period in which they are recorded 

table of contents under the fair value hierarchy  management uses certain assumptions and judgments to derive the fair value of its investments  particularly for those assets with significant unobservable inputs  commonly referred to as level assets 
at december   the company s financial instruments that were measured at fair value and categorized as level were as follows in millions of us dollars december  fixed maturities equities other invested assets including certain derivatives funds held directly managed account total for the company s fixed maturities  equities  other invested assets and investments underlying the funds held directly managed account categorized as level  a decline in the fair value of these investments at december  would result in a million pre tax charge to net income or loss and a corresponding reduction in total assets 
in addition  included in the company s other invested assets are various investments which are accounted for using the cost method of accounting  equity method of accounting or investment company accounting  totaling million at december  the company does not measure its investments that are accounted for using any of these methods at fair value 
for investments that are accounted for using the cost method of accounting  equity method of accounting or investment company accounting  a decline in the carrying value of these investments at december  would result in a million pre tax charge to net income or loss and a corresponding reduction in investments and total assets 
the company utilizes derivatives for a variety of purposes see note to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
the company s derivatives are carried at fair value  which is based on quoted market prices or internal valuation models where quoted market prices are not available 
most of the company s derivatives are fair valued using significant other observable inputs fair value of million net unrealized loss at december   referred to as level assets 
the company s derivatives that are fair valued using quoted prices in active markets  referred to as level assets  had an insignificant fair value at december  in addition  the company has certain total return swaps and insurance linked securities that are fair valued using significant other unobservable inputs  and are included in the level other invested assets 
the total return swaps and insurance linked securities that are classified as level have a combined fair value of million net unrealized gain at december   based on a combined notional exposure of million 
in aggregate  the company is not significantly exposed to changes in the valuation of its total return and interest rate swap portfolio due to changes in the general level of interest rates 
at december   the company estimated that a basis point increase or decrease in all risk spread assumptions used in the company s internal valuation models would result in a million decrease or a million increase  respectively  in the fair value of its total return and interest rate swap portfolio categorized as level the company is exposed to changes in the expected amount of future cash flows of the reference assets in its total return swap portfolio 
the company s total return swap portfolio references many different underlying assets with a number of risk factors 
at december   the notional value of the total return swap portfolio categorized as level was million and the fair value of the assets underlying the total return swap portfolio categorized as level was million 
the company estimated that each increase or decrease in the amount of all expected future cash flows related to the reference assets would result in an insignificant increase or decrease  respectively  in the fair value of its total return swap portfolio at december  at december   the company s insurance linked securities that are classified as level include longevity swaps and weather derivatives  with a combined fair value of million net unrealized loss 
at 
table of contents december   the notional exposure of the longevity swaps and weather derivatives classified as level was million and nil  respectively 
at december   the company estimated that a improvement in the mortality assumption used in the company s internal valuation models for its longevity swaps would result in a million decrease in the fair value of its longevity swap portfolio 
the weather derivatives categorized as level are exposed to various wind events  and any change in the assumptions used in the company s internal models would have an insignificant impact on the fair value of weather derivatives at december  goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired of partnerre sa  winterthur re  paris re and presidio 
the company assesses the appropriateness of its valuation of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
if  as a result of the assessment  the company determines that the value of its goodwill is impaired  goodwill will be written down in the period in which the determination is made 
neither the company s initial valuation nor its subsequent valuations has indicated any impairment of the company s goodwill asset of million at december  in making an assessment of the value of its goodwill  the company uses both market based and non market based valuations 
the fair value of the reporting units is determined based on the earnings multiple  price to tangible book value multiple  present value of estimated cash flows and present value of future profits methods 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an assessment of impairment of the company s goodwill asset 
in addition  if the current economic environment and or the company s financial performance were to deteriorate significantly  this could lead to an impairment of goodwill  the write off of which would be recorded against net income in the period such deterioration occurred 
intangible assets intangible assets represent the fair value adjustments related to unpaid losses and loss expenses and the fair values of renewal rights  customer relationships  us licenses and fronting arrangements arising from the acquisitions of paris re and presidio 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives  generally ranging from one to thirteen years 
the company recognizes the amortization of all intangible assets in the consolidated statement of operations 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization 
the carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment on at least an annual basis 
impairment is recognized if the carrying values of the intangible assets are not recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows and are measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value 
based upon the company s assessment  there was no impairment of its intangible assets of million at december  results of operations the following discussion of results of operations contains forward looking statements based upon assumptions and expectations concerning the potential effect of future events that are subject to uncertainties 
see item a of part i of this report for a complete list of the company s risk factors 
any of these risk factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward looking statements 
the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
the company s significant subsidiaries and branches have one of the following functional currencies us dollar  euro or canadian dollar 
as a significant portion of the company s operations is transacted in foreign currencies  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may affect year over year comparisons 
to the extent that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect comparisons  their impact has been quantified  when possible  and discussed in each of the relevant sections 
see note m to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for a discussion of translation of foreign currencies

underwriting result consists of net premiums earned and other income or loss less losses and loss expenses and life policy benefits  acquisition costs and other operating expenses 
investment result consists of net investment income  net realized and unrealized investment gains or losses and interest in earnings or losses of equity investments 
net investment income includes interest and dividends  net of investment expenses  generated by the company s investment activities  as well as interest income generated on funds held assets 
net realized and unrealized investment gains or losses include sales of the company s fixed income  equity and other invested assets and investments underlying the funds held directly managed account and changes in net unrealized gains or losses 
interest in earnings or losses of equity investments includes the company s strategic investments 
other components of net income or loss include technical result and other income or loss  other operating expenses  interest expense  amortization of intangible assets  net foreign exchange gains or losses and income tax expense or benefit 
the components of net income loss for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions of us dollars change change underwriting result non life nm nm life investment result net investment income net realized and unrealized investment gains interest in earnings losses of equity investments nm nm corporate and other technical result nm other income other operating expenses interest expense amortization of intangible assets net foreign exchange losses gains nm nm income tax expense net income loss  nm nm nm not meaningful interest in earnings losses of equity investments represents the company s aggregate share of earnings related to several private placement investments and limited partnerships within the corporate and other segment 
technical result and other income primarily relate to income on insurance linked securities and principal finance transactions within the corporate and other segment 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets relates to intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of paris re in the acquisition of presidio was effective december  and  accordingly  no amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired has been recorded during the years ended december   and underwriting result is a measurement that the company uses to manage and evaluate its non life and life segments  as it is a primary measure of underlying profitability for the company s core reinsurance operations  separate from the investment results 
the company believes that in order to enhance the understanding of its profitability  it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of net income or loss separately and in the aggregate 
underwriting result should not be considered a substitute for net income or loss and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business  which is also impacted by investment results and other items 
the following table provides the components of the underwriting result and combined ratio for the non life segment for the years ended december   and and the components are discussed further below in millions of us dollars current accident year technical result and ratio adjusted for large catastrophic losses and large losses large catastrophic losses and large losses prior accident years technical result and ratio net favorable prior year loss development technical result and ratio  as reported other income other operating expenses underwriting result and combined ratio  as reported large catastrophic losses and large losses are shown net of any reinsurance  reinstatement premiums and profit commissions

other operating expenses a decrease of million a decrease of points on the combined ratio from million points on the combined ratio in to million points on the combined ratio in  primarily resulting from a favorable impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and lower information technology costs 

table of contents these factors driving the increase in the non life underwriting result and the corresponding decrease in the combined ratio in compared to were partially offset by the current accident year technical result  adjusted for large catastrophic losses and large losses a decrease of million an increase of points on the technical ratio from million points on the technical ratio in to million points on the technical ratio in the decrease was driven by a lower level of net premiums earned in the catastrophe sub segment  which absent catastrophe losses  directly reduces the underwriting result  and a lower level of losses recovered under the retrocessional programs 
these decreases were partially offset by a lower level of mid sized loss activity in the global non us specialty and north america sub segments 
the underwriting result for the life segment  which does not include allocated investment income  improved by million  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in  primarily due to higher net favorable prior year loss development  which was driven by the mortality line of business 
see results by segment below 
net investment income decreased by million  from million in to million in the decrease in net investment income is primarily attributable to a decrease in net investment income from fixed maturities due to lower reinvestment rates 
see corporate and other net investment income below for more details 
net realized and unrealized investment gains increased by million  from million in to million in the net realized and unrealized investment gains of million in were primarily due to narrowing credit spreads  improvements in worldwide equity markets and decreases in us and european risk free interest rates

results by segment the company monitors the performance of its operations in three segments  non life  life and corporate other 
the non life segment is further divided into four sub segments  north america  global non us property and casualty global non us p c  global non us specialty and catastrophe 
segments and sub segments represent markets that are reasonably homogeneous in terms of geography  client types  buying patterns  underlying risk patterns and approach to risk management 
see the description of the company s segments and sub segments as well as a discussion of how the company measures its segment results in note to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
non life segment north america the north america sub segment is comprised of lines of business that are considered to be either short  medium or long tail 
the short tail lines consist primarily of agriculture  property and motor business 
casualty is considered to be long tail  while credit surety and multiline are considered to have a medium tail 
the casualty line typically tends to have a higher loss ratio and a lower technical result  due to the long tail nature of the risks involved 
casualty treaties typically provide for investment income on premiums invested over a longer period as losses are typically paid later than for other lines 
investment income  however  is not considered in the calculation of technical result 
the following table provides the components of the technical result and the corresponding ratios for this sub segment for the years ended december   and in millions of us dollars change change gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned losses and loss expenses acquisition costs technical result loss ratio acquisition ratio technical ratio technical result is defined as net premiums earned less losses and loss expenses and acquisition costs 
loss ratio is obtained by dividing losses and loss expenses by net premiums earned 
acquisition ratio is obtained by dividing acquisition costs by net premiums earned 
technical ratio is defined as the sum of the loss ratio and the acquisition ratio

the increase in the casualty line of business was primarily driven by new business written and higher upward prior year premium adjustments 
the increase in the property line of business was due to new business written 
these increases in gross and net premiums written were partially offset by reductions in the motor line of business as a result of non renewals of certain treaties 
the increase in net premiums earned was lower than the increase in gross and net premiums written due to the earning of the reduced level of premiums written in  primarily in the property line as a result of cancellations and lower renewals  and due to the impact of the new casualty and property business in being written on a proportional basis  which is yet to be fully reflected in net premiums earned 
notwithstanding the diverse conditions prevailing in various markets within this sub segment  with terms and conditions in most markets deteriorating slightly  and price increases generally in loss affected markets only  the company was able to write business that met its portfolio objectives 
compared to gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned increased by  and  respectively  in compared to the increases in gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned were primarily attributable to the agriculture line of business and were mainly driven by increased demand  higher agricultural commodity prices and lower downward premium adjustments

outlook during the january  renewals  the company generally observed price improvements in certain loss affected markets and increased competition and pressure on pricing and terms in other markets 
overall  the expected premium volume from the company s january  renewal  at constant foreign exchange rates  increased compared to the prior year renewal as a result of new growth opportunities in several of our specialty lines markets 
management expects a continuation of the observed trends in pricing and terms and conditions during the remainder of catastrophe the catastrophe sub segment writes business predominantly on a non proportional basis and is exposed to volatility from catastrophic losses  as demonstrated by the sub segment results for  and  and as a result  profitability in any one year is not necessarily predictive of future profitability 
the catastrophe sub segment results for included a comparatively low level of catastrophic losses related to superstorm sandy  while the results for included a comparatively large level of catastrophic losses related to the chile earthquake and new zealand earthquake and the results for included a comparatively significant amount of losses from a high frequency of high severity catastrophic events related to the catastrophic events 
the varying amounts of catastrophic losses significantly impacted the technical result and ratio and affected year over year comparisons as discussed below

outlook during the january  renewals  the company observed pricing that was either flat or slightly lower in most markets compared to the prior year renewal 
the exception to this was in certain loss affected markets  where modest price increases were observed 
the expected premium volume from the company s january  renewal  at constant foreign exchange rates  decreased compared to the prior year renewal primarily as a result of modestly declining market conditions and cedants retaining more business

compared to gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned increased by  and on a constant foreign exchange basis  respectively  in compared to the increase in gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned was primarily due to new business written during in the longevity line  which is fully reflected in  as well as new business and growth in the mortality line 
these increases in gross and net premiums written and net premiums earned were partially offset by a decrease related to the restructuring of a longevity treaty 

table of contents allocated underwriting result compared to the allocated underwriting result increased by million  from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to an increased level of net favorable prior year loss development of million in the mortality line of business  as described below 
to a lesser extent  the increase was due to improvements in the profitability of the longevity line of business driven by the new business written during the fourth quarter of and an increase in other income due to a higher volume of insurance linked securities and treaties accounted for using deposit accounting  where the company earns a margin 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in claims activity on certain long term treaties in the mortality line of business 
the increase in the net favorable prior year loss development of million reflects net favorable loss development of million in compared to net favorable loss development of million in the net favorable prior year loss development of million in was primarily due to the gmdb business  mainly driven by improvements in the capital markets  and due to certain short term treaties in the mortality line of business 
the net favorable prior year loss development of million in is described below 
compared to the allocated underwriting result increased by million  from million in to million in the increase in the allocated underwriting result was due to a decrease of million in net adverse prior year loss development  increased profitability generated from new and existing business and a decrease in other operating expenses  which were partially offset by a decrease in net investment income 
the decrease in the net adverse prior year loss development of million in  reflected million of net favorable prior year loss development in compared to million of net adverse prior year loss development in the modest net favorable prior year loss development of million in was the net result of favorable prior year loss development of million related to certain mortality treaties and the gmdb business  which was almost entirely offset by adverse prior year loss development related to disability riders on certain short term non proportional treaties in the mortality line 
the net adverse prior year loss development of million in was primarily driven by adverse development of million due to an improvement in mortality trend related to an impaired life annuity treaty in the longevity line and adverse development on certain mortality treaties 
this adverse development was partially offset by favorable prior year loss development of million resulting from the gmdb business 
net investment income decreased by million  from million in to million in primarily due to a decrease in the funds held balance related to the restructuring of a longevity treaty and lower positive adjustments on funds held contracts reported by cedants 
outlook the acquisition of presidio  which will be reported in the life segment from january   is expected to result in substantial overall premium growth in the life segment in and beyond 
currently  presidio principally operates as an mgu  writing all of its business on behalf of third party insurance companies and earning a fee for producing the business 
the third party insurance companies then cede a portion of the original business written through quota share reinsurance agreements to presidio s reinsurance subsidiary  such that presidio participates in the original premiums and losses incurred related to the business it has produced and ensuring an alignment of interests with the third party insurance companies 
during  the company will obtain the necessary licenses and approvals to write this business directly itself and will transition these relationships from the third party insurance companies 
in terms of the company s existing life portfolio  the majority of the premium arises from in force contracts that are written on a continuous basis 
the active january renewals impact a relatively limited portion of the in force premium in the mortality line 
for those treaties that actively renewed  pricing conditions and 
table of contents terms were generally unchanged from the january  renewals 
the expected premium volume from the company s january  renewal  at constant foreign exchange rates  increased due to new short term mortality business 
management expects moderate continued growth in the company s existing life portfolio in  assuming constant foreign exchange rates 
premium distribution by line of business the distribution of net premiums written by line of business for the years ended december   and was as follows non life property and casualty casualty motor multiline and other property specialty agriculture aviation space catastrophe credit surety energy engineering marine specialty casualty specialty property life total the changes in the distribution of net premiums written by line of business between  and reflected the company s response to existing market conditions  with the comparison between and specifically affected by the repositioning of its portfolio following the integration of paris re and the reduction of catastrophe exposed business 
the distribution of net premiums written may also be affected by the timing of renewals of treaties  a change in treaty structure  premium adjustments reported by cedants and significant increases or decreases in other lines of business 
in addition  foreign exchange fluctuations affected the comparison for all lines 
casualty the increase in the distribution of net premiums written in compared to was driven primarily by new business written and higher upward prior year premium adjustments in the north america sub segment 
property the decrease in the distribution of net premiums written between  and was driven primarily by the effects of the company s decisions to reduce certain exposures  lower pricing and the repositioning of its portfolio following the integration of paris re s business  which included reducing the level of catastrophe exposed business 
agriculture the increase in the distribution of net premiums written in and compared to was driven by increased demand  higher agricultural commodity prices and lower downward premium adjustments in the north america sub segment 
catastrophe the decrease in the distribution of net premiums written in compared to was due to the company reducing certain exposures by cancelling and decreasing treaty participations 
the decrease in the distribution of net premiums written in compared to was driven by the 
table of contents repositioning of the company s portfolio following the integration of paris re  which included reducing the level of catastrophe exposed business 
given the absolute decrease in catastrophe net premiums written was  the percentage distribution by line of business only decreased by in compared to due to significant decreases in other lines of business 
outlook based on information received from cedants and brokers during the january  renewals  and assuming that similar trends and conditions to those experienced during the january  renewals continue through the year  management expects the distribution of net premiums written by lines to be broadly comparable to the exceptions to this are expected to be an increase in the agriculture line of business due to new business and an increase in the life segment due to the presidio acquisition  and a modest decline in the catastrophe sub segment due to lower january  renewals and increases in other lines of business 
premium distribution by reinsurance type the company typically writes business on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
on proportional business  the company shares proportionally in both the premiums and losses of the cedant 
on non proportional business  the company is typically exposed to loss events in excess of a predetermined dollar amount or loss ratio 
in both proportional and non proportional business  the company typically reinsures a large group of primary insurance contracts written by the ceding company 
in addition  the company writes business on a facultative basis 
facultative arrangements are generally specific to an individual risk and can be written on either a proportional or non proportional basis 
generally  the company has more influence over pricing  as well as terms and conditions  in non proportional and facultative arrangements 
the distribution of gross premiums written by reinsurance type for the years ended december   and was as follows non life segment proportional non proportional facultative life segment total substantially all of the life segment s gross premiums written for the periods presented are written on a proportional basis 
the distribution of gross premiums written by reinsurance type is affected by changes in the allocation of capacity among lines of business  the timing of receipt by the company of cedant accounts and premium adjustments by cedants 
in addition  foreign exchange fluctuations affected the comparison for all treaty types 
the changes in the distribution of gross premiums written by reinsurance type between and primarily reflect a shift from non proportional business to proportional business in the non life segment 
this shift was driven by an increase in the casualty and property lines of business in the north america sub segment and by a reduction in the business written in the catastrophe sub segment 
the changes in the distribution of gross premiums written by reinsurance type between and primarily reflect a shift from non proportional business to facultative business in the non life segment and a shift in mix from the non life segment to the life segment 
the shift from non proportional to facultative business was driven by a reduction in catastrophe exposed business  new business written and positive premium 
table of contents adjustments 
the shift in the mix of business from the non life segment to the life segment results from the decreases in gross premiums written following the cancellation and reduction of business and the repositioning of the company s portfolio in certain lines of the non life segment compared to increases in gross premiums written in the life segment 
outlook based on renewal information from cedants and brokers during the january  renewals  and assuming that similar trends and conditions to those experienced during the january  renewals continue through the year  management expects the relative distribution of gross premiums written by reinsurance type to shift modestly from non proportional business to proportional business 
this expected shift in the distribution of gross premiums written reflects the expected increase in the agriculture line of business as described above  which is primarily written on a proportional basis  and a modest decline in the catastrophe sub segment s gross premiums written as described above  which is primarily written on a non proportional basis 
premium distribution by geographic region the following table provides the geographic distribution of gross premiums written based on the location of the underlying risk for the years ended december   and europe north america asia  australia and new zealand latin america  caribbean and africa total the distribution of gross premiums written in was comparable to the decrease in the distribution of gross premiums written in europe in compared to was primarily driven by the cancellation and reduction of business and the repositioning of the company s portfolio following the integration of paris re 
this decrease was partially offset by higher gross premiums written in the company s life segment and the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations  as premiums denominated in currencies that have appreciated against us dollar were converted into us dollar at higher average exchange rates 
outlook based on information received from cedants and brokers during the january  renewals  and assuming that similar trends and conditions to those experienced during the january  renewals continue through the year and based on constant foreign exchange rates  management expects the distribution of gross premiums written by geographic region in to shift modestly from most geographic regions to north america as a result of the expected increases in gross premiums written in the agriculture line of business and the life segment as described above 

table of contents premium distribution by production source the company generates its gross premiums written both through brokers and through direct relationships with cedants 
the percentage of gross premiums written by production source for the years ended december   and was as follows broker direct total the percentage of gross premiums written through brokers in decreased compared to due to a decrease in the business written through brokers  and an increase in the business written directly  in the company s global non us p c and specialty sub segments and a decrease related to certain treaties written through brokers in the catastrophe sub segment 
the percentage of gross premiums written through brokers in was comparable to outlook based on information received from cedants and brokers during the january  renewals  and assuming that similar trends and conditions to those experienced during the january  renewals continue through the year  management expects the production source of gross premiums written in to be comparable to corporate and other corporate and other is comprised of the company s capital markets and investment related activities  including principal finance transactions  insurance linked securities and strategic investments  and its corporate activities  including other operating expenses

the following discussion includes net investment income from all investment activities  including the net investment income allocated to the life segment 
compared to net investment income decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in net investment income from fixed maturities as a result of lower reinvestment rates  
table of contents a decrease in net investment income from funds held directly managed primarily related to the lower average balance in the funds held directly managed account  which was driven by the release of assets due to the run off of the underlying liabilities  and the strengthening of the us dollar  on average  in compared to  which contributed a decrease in net investment income  partially offset by an increase in dividends received from equities in compared to net investment income decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in net investment income from fixed maturities  short term investments and cash and cash equivalents primarily due to lower reinvestment rates  which was partially offset by purchases of higher yielding investments and the reinvestment of cash flows from operations  and a decrease in net investment income from funds held directly managed primarily related to the lower average balance in the funds held directly managed account  which was related to the release of assets following the endorsement see funds held directly managed below to the quota share retrocessional agreement with colis e re in february and the run off of the underlying liabilities 
the assets released from the funds held directly managed account were reinvested in the company s fixed maturity portfolio at lower reinvestment rates  partially offset by the weakening of the us dollar  on average  in compared to which contributed a increase in net investment income 
outlook assuming constant foreign exchange rates  management expects net investment income to decrease in compared to primarily due to lower reinvestment rates with low yields expected to continue throughout management expects this decrease to be partially offset by expected positive cash flow from operations including net investment income 
net realized and unrealized investment gains the company s portfolio managers have dual investment objectives of optimizing current investment income and achieving capital appreciation 
to meet these objectives  it is often desirable to buy and sell securities to take advantage of changing market conditions and to reposition the investment portfolios 
accordingly  recognition of realized gains and losses is considered by the company to be a normal consequence of its ongoing investment management activities 
in addition  the company records changes in fair value for substantially all of its investments as unrealized investment gains or losses in its consolidated statements of operations 
realized and unrealized investment gains and losses are generally a function of multiple factors  with the most significant being prevailing interest rates  credit spreads  and equity market conditions

table of contents unrealized investment gains on other invested assets were a combined loss of million in and primarily related to losses on treasury note futures  which were partially offset by unrealized gains on certain non publicly traded investments and net realized and unrealized gains on total return swaps 
net realized and unrealized investment gains on funds held directly managed of million and million in and  respectively  primarily related to net realized and the change in net unrealized investment gains on fixed maturities and short term investments in the segregated investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account and were due to decreases in us and european risk free interest rates 
other operating expenses the company s total other operating expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions of us dollars change change other operating expenses other operating expenses represent  and of net premiums earned both non life and life for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other operating expenses included in corporate and other were million  million and million  of which million  million and million are related to corporate activities for the years ended december   and  respectively 
compared to other operating expenses decreased by in compared to primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations which decreased other operating expenses by due to the stronger us dollar 
to a lesser extent  the decrease was also due to decreases in information technology  banking related and travel costs 
compared to other operating expenses decreased by in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a charge of million in related to the company s voluntary plan  lower personnel costs including lower share based compensation expenses and lower costs related to paris re s operations following its integration into the company s operations 
these decreases in other operating expenses were partially offset by foreign exchange fluctuations  which increased other operating expenses by due to the weakening of the us dollar in compared to income taxes the company s effective income tax rate  which we calculate as income tax expense or benefit divided by net income or loss before taxes  may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on the geographic distribution of pre tax net income or loss in any given period between different jurisdictions with comparatively higher tax rates and those with comparatively lower tax rates 
the geographic distribution of pre tax net income or loss can vary significantly between periods due to  but not limited to  the following factors the business mix of net premiums written and earned  the geographic location  quantum and nature of net losses and loss expenses incurred  the quantum and geographic location of other operating expenses  net investment income  net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses  and the quantum of specific adjustments to determine the income tax basis in each of the company s operating jurisdictions 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s gross and net premiums are currently written and earned in bermuda  a non taxable jurisdiction  including the majority of the company s catastrophe business  which can result in significant volatility in the company s pre tax net income or loss from period to period 

table of contents the company s income tax expense and effective income tax rate for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions of us dollars income tax expense effective income tax rate compared to income tax expense and the effective income tax rate during were million and  respectively 
income tax expense and the effective income tax rate during were primarily driven by the geographic distribution of the company s pre tax net income between its various taxable and non taxable jurisdictions 
specifically  the income tax expense and the effective income tax rate included a relatively even distribution of the company s pre tax net income between its various jurisdictions 
the company s pre tax net income recorded in non taxable jurisdictions and jurisdictions with comparatively lower tax rates reflects net favorable prior year loss development and net realized and unrealized investment gains  which were partially offset by catastrophe losses

table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the company purchased  as part of its acquisition of paris re  an investment portfolio and a funds held directly managed account 
the discussion of the acquired paris re investment portfolio is included in the discussion of investments below 
the discussion of the segregated investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account is included separately in funds held directly managed below 
investments investment philosophy the company employs a prudent investment philosophy 
it maintains a high quality  well balanced and liquid portfolio having the dual objectives of optimizing current investment income and achieving capital appreciation 
the company s invested assets are comprised of total investments  cash and cash equivalents and accrued investment income 
from a risk management perspective  the company allocates its invested assets into two categories liability funds and capital funds 
liability funds including funds held directly managed represent invested assets supporting the net reinsurance liabilities  defined as the company s operating and reinsurance liabilities net of reinsurance assets  and are invested primarily in high quality fixed maturity securities 
the preservation of liquidity and protection of capital are the primary investment objectives for these assets 
the portfolio managers are required to adhere to investment guidelines as to minimum ratings and issuer and sector concentration limitations 
liability funds are invested in a way that generally matches them to the corresponding liabilities referred to as asset liability matching in terms of both duration and major currency composition to provide the company with a natural hedge against changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the company utilizes certain derivatives to further protect against changes in interest and foreign exchange rates 
capital funds represent shareholder capital of the company and are invested in a diversified portfolio with the objective of maximizing investment return  subject to prudent risk constraints 
capital funds contain most of the asset classes typically viewed as offering a higher risk and higher return profile  subject to risk assumption and portfolio diversification guidelines which include issuer and sector concentration limitations 
capital funds may be invested in investment grade and below investment grade fixed maturity securities  preferred and common stocks  private placement equity and bond investments  emerging markets and high yield fixed income securities and certain other specialty asset classes 
the company believes that an allocation of a portion of its investments to equities is both prudent and desirable  as it helps to achieve broader asset diversification lower risk and maximizes the portfolio s total return over time 
the company s total invested assets at december  and were split between liability and capital funds as follows in millions of us dollars of total invested assets of total invested assets liability funds capital funds total the liability funds were comprised of cash and cash equivalents and high quality fixed income securities 
the decrease in the liability funds at december  compared to december  primarily reflects a decrease in unpaid losses and loss expenses which was largely driven by a significant level of loss payments related to the catastrophic events 
the capital funds were generally comprised of accrued investment income  investment grade and below investment grade fixed maturity securities  preferred and common stocks  private placement equity and bond investments  emerging markets and high yield fixed income securities and certain other specialty asset classes

a significant portion of the company s reinsurance business is conducted with cedants in europe  with the collection of premiums and the payment of claims denominated in 
table of contents the euro 
as described above  the currency composition of the company s liability funds generally matches the underlying net reinsurance liabilities to protect against changes in foreign exchange rates 
accordingly  the company s liability funds that are held to match net reinsurance liabilities that are denominated in the euro  expose the company s investment portfolio and the investments underlying the funds held directly managed account to bonds that are denominated in the euro that are issued by european sovereign governments and government agencies  corporate bonds that are issued by companies in europe including those that are also guaranteed by a european sovereign government and equities issued by companies in europe 
as a result of the uncertainties related to european sovereign government debt exposures  and uncertainties surrounding europe in general  the company implemented additional risk management guidelines to reduce and mitigate potential risks arising from these exposures in its investment portfolio and in the investments underlying the funds held directly managed account 
these guidelines reflect the company s response to current conditions and the guidelines may change as the dynamics of the underlying conditions and uncertainties change 
the company s current guidelines include  but are not limited to  the following since the beginning of the company has eliminated substantially all of its investment exposure to bonds issued by european sovereign governments in the peripheral countries portugal  italy  ireland  greece and spain  and during the second half of  the company focused its european sovereign government exposure to five highly rated countries 
these five countries  germany  france  netherlands  belgium  and austria are rated aaa  aa  aaa  aa and aa by standard poor s 
the company s exposures to european sovereign governments and other european related investment risks are discussed above within each category of the company s investment portfolio and the investments underlying the funds held directly managed account 
in addition  the company s other investment and derivative exposures to european counterparties are discussed in other invested assets above 
see risk factors in item ia of part i of this report for further discussion on the company s exposure to the european sovereign debt crisis 
funds held by reinsured companies cedants in addition to the funds held directly managed account described above  the company writes certain business on a funds held basis 
the following discussion excludes the funds held directly managed account 
under such contractual arrangements  the cedant retains the net funds that would have otherwise been remitted to the company and credits the net fund balance with investment income 
at december  and  the company recorded million and million  respectively  of funds held assets in its consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the five largest cedants represented of the funds held balance 
approximately of the funds held balance at december  related to contracts that earned investment income based upon a predetermined interest rate  either fixed contractually at the inception of the contract or based upon a recognized market index eg  libor 
interest rates ranged from to for the year ended december  under these contractual arrangements  there are no specific assets linked to the funds held assets  and the company is only exposed to the credit risk of the cedant 
these arrangements include three of the five cedants with the largest funds held assets  which represented of the company s total funds held balance 
with respect to the remaining of the funds held balance at december   the company receives an investment return based upon either the results of a pool of assets held by the cedant  or the investment return earned by the cedant on its entire investment portfolio 
this portion of the company s funds held assets at december  included two of the five cedants with the largest funds held assets  which represented of the company s total funds held balance 
the company does not legally own or directly control the investments underlying its funds held assets and only has recourse to the cedant for the receivable balances and no claim to the underlying securities that support the balances 
decisions as to purchases and sales of assets underlying the funds held balances are made 
table of contents by the cedant  in some circumstances  investment guidelines regarding the minimum credit quality of the underlying assets may be agreed upon between the cedant and the company as part of the reinsurance agreement  or the company may participate in an investment oversight committee regarding the investment of the net funds  but investment decisions are not otherwise influenced by the company 
within this portion of the funds held assets  the company has several annuity treaties which are structured so that the return on the funds held balances is tied to the performance of an underlying group of assets held by the cedant  including fluctuations in the market value of the underlying assets 
one such treaty is a retrocessional agreement under which the company receives more limited data than what is generally received under a direct reinsurance agreement 
in these arrangements  the objective of the reinsurance agreement is to provide for the covered longevity risk and to earn a net investment return on an underlying pool of assets greater than is contractually due to the annuity holders 
while the company is also exposed to the creditworthiness of the cedant  the company s credit risk in some jurisdictions is mitigated by a mandatory right of offset of amounts payable by the company to a cedant against amounts due to the company 
in certain other jurisdictions the company is able to mitigate this risk  depending on the nature of the funds held arrangements  to the extent that the company has the contractual ability to offset any shortfall in the payment of the funds held balances with amounts owed by the company to cedants for losses payable and other amounts contractually due 
the company also has non life treaties in which the investment performance of the net funds held asset corresponds to the interest income on the assets held by the cedant  however  the company is not directly exposed to the underlying credit risk of these investments  as they serve only as collateral for the company s receivables 
that is  the amount owed to the company is unaffected by changes in the market value of the investments underlying the funds held 
unpaid losses and loss expenses the company establishes loss reserves to cover the estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the contracts that the company writes 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability 
estimates of ultimate liabilities are contingent on many future events and the eventual outcome of these events may be different from the assumptions underlying the reserve estimates 
the company believes that the recorded unpaid losses and loss expenses represent management s best estimate of the cost to settle the ultimate liabilities based on information available at december  the non life reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses at december  and include reserves guaranteed by colis e re see business reserves in item of part i and note to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for a discussion of the reserve agreement

on february   the company issued  of series f non cumulative redeemable preferred shares series f preferred shares for a total consideration of million after underwriting discounts  commissions and other related expenses 
the company will have a non cumulative dividend commitment of million per annum and an aggregate redemption value of million 
see shareholders equity and capital resources management shareholders equity below for more details related to the series f preferred shares 
shareholders equity and capital resources management shareholders equity was billion at december   a increase compared to billion at december  the major factors contributing to the increase in shareholders equity during the year ended december  were comprehensive income of  million  of which net income contributed  million  partially offset by a net decrease of million  due to the repurchase of common shares of million under the company s share repurchase program  partially offset by the issuance of common shares under the company s employee equity plans of million  and dividend payments of million related to both the company s common and preferred shares 
see results of operations and review of net income loss above for a discussion of the company s net income for the year ended december  as part of its long term strategy  the company will continue to actively manage capital resources to support its operations throughout the reinsurance cycle and for the benefit of its shareholders  subject to the ability to maintain strong ratings from the major rating agencies and the unquestioned ability to pay claims as they arise 
generally  the company seeks to increase its capital when its current capital position is not sufficient to support 
table of contents the volume of attractive business opportunities available 
conversely  the company will seek to reduce its capital  through the payment of dividends on its common shares or stock repurchases  when available business opportunities are insufficient or unattractive to fully utilize the company s capital at adequate returns 
the company may also seek to reduce or restructure its capital through the repayment or purchase of debt obligations  or increase or restructure its capital through the issuance of debt  when opportunities arise 
management uses compound annual growth rate in diluted book value per share as a measure of the value the company is generating for its common shareholders  as management believes that growth in the company s diluted book value per share ultimately translates into growth in the company s share price 
diluted book value per share is impacted by the company s net income or loss  capital resources management and external factors such as foreign exchange  interest rates  credit spreads and equity markets  which can drive changes in realized and unrealized gains or losses on the company s investment portfolio 
diluted book value per common share and common share equivalents outstanding is calculated using common shareholders equity shareholders equity less the aggregate liquidation value of preferred shares divided by the number of fully diluted common shares and common share equivalents outstanding assuming exercise of all stock based awards and other dilutive securities 
the company s diluted book value per share increased by to at december  from at december   due to the same factors describing the increase in shareholders equity above and the accretive impact of the share repurchases 
the year and year compound annual growth rates in diluted book value per share were in excess of and  respectively  and are further discussed in key financial measures

table of contents liquidity liquidity is a measure of the company s ability to access sufficient cash flows to meet the short term and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
management believes that its significant cash flows from operations and high quality liquid investment portfolio will provide sufficient liquidity for the foreseeable future 
at december  and  cash and cash equivalents were billion and billion  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the company s share repurchases and significant loss payments related to the catastrophic losses  which were partially offset by cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations in increased to million from million in  primarily due to higher underwriting cash flows 
the higher underwriting cash flows were primarily due to a lower  although still significant  level of losses paid in compared to underwriting cash flows in reflected cash received of approximately million related to the release of assets from the funds held directly managed account to partner reinsurance europe se pursuant to an endorsement to a quota share reinsurance agreement with colis e re  which was partially offset by significant loss payments related to the catastrophic events 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to  million during the net cash used in investing activities in reflects the investment of the cash provided by operations that was not used to fund the company s share repurchases 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in net cash used in financing activities in was primarily related to share repurchases and dividend payments on common and preferred shares 
net cash used in financing activities in was also related to the company s share repurchases and dividend payments on common and preferred shares  but was partially offset by the net proceeds of million related to the issuance of the series e preferred shares 
the parent company is a holding company with no operations or significant assets other than the capital stock of its subsidiaries and other intercompany balances 
the parent company has cash outflows in the form of operating expenses  interest payments related to its debt  dividends to both common and preferred shareholders and  from time to time  cash outflows for principal repayments related to its debt  and the repurchase of its common shares under its share repurchase program 
for the year ended december   the parent company incurred other operating expenses of million  common dividends paid were million  preferred dividends paid were million and share repurchases were million 
in february  the company announced that it was increasing its quarterly dividend to per common share or approximately million in total for  assuming a constant number of common shares outstanding and a constant dividend rate  and it will pay approximately million in dividends to preferred shareholders in the company relies primarily on cash dividends and payments from its reinsurance subsidiaries to pay the operating expenses  interest expense  shareholder dividends and other obligations of the holding company that may arise from time to time 
the company expects future dividends and other permitted payments from its reinsurance subsidiaries to be the principal source of its funds to pay such expenses and dividends 
the payment of dividends by the reinsurance subsidiaries to partnerre ltd 
is limited under bermuda and irish laws and certain statutes of various us states in which partnerre us is licensed to transact business 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and or certain levels of policyholders earned surplus as determined in accordance with the relevant statutory accounting practices 
at december   there were no significant restrictions on the company s reinsurance subsidiaries that would limit the company s ability to pay common and preferred shareholders dividends see note to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
the reinsurance subsidiaries of the company depend upon cash inflows from the collection of premiums as well as investment income and proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments to meet their obligations 
cash outflows are in the form of claims payments  purchase of investments  operating expenses  income tax payments  intercompany payments as well as dividend payments to the holding company  and additionally  in the 
table of contents case of partnerre us holdings  interest payments on the senior notes and the cents 
at december   partnerre us holdings and its subsidiaries have million in senior notes and million of cents outstanding and will pay approximately million in aggregate interest payments in related to this debt 
historically  the operating subsidiaries of the company have generated sufficient cash flows to meet all of their obligations 
because of the inherent volatility of the business written by the company  the seasonality in the timing of payments by cedants  the irregular timing of loss payments  the impact of a change in interest rates and credit spreads on the investment income as well as seasonality in coupon payment dates for fixed income securities  cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly between periods 
the company believes that annual positive cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to cover claims payments  absent a series of additional large catastrophic loss activity 
in the event that paid losses accelerate beyond the ability to fund such payments from operating cash flows  the company would use its cash balances available  liquidate a portion of its high quality and liquid investment portfolio or borrow under the company s revolving line of credit see credit facilities below 
as discussed in investments above  the company s investments and cash totaled billion at december   the main components of which were investment grade fixed maturities  short term investments and cash and cash equivalents totaling billion 
financial strength ratings and senior unsecured debt ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies on the company s capacity to meet its obligations 
in the event of a significant downgrade in ratings  the company s ability to write business and to access the capital markets could be impacted 
some of the company s reinsurance treaties contain special funding and termination clauses that would be triggered in the event the company or one of its subsidiaries is downgraded by one of the major rating agencies to levels specified in the treaties  or the company s capital is significantly reduced 
if such an event were to occur  the company would be required  in certain instances  to post collateral in the form of letters of credit and or trust accounts against existing outstanding losses  if any  related to the treaty 
in a limited number of instances  the subject treaties could be cancelled retroactively or commuted by the cedant 
the company s current financial strength ratings are standard poor s a moody s a am best a negative outlook fitch aa credit agreements in the normal course of its operations  the company enters into agreements with financial institutions to obtain unsecured and secured credit facilities 
at december   the total amount of such credit facilities available to the company was  million  with each of the significant facilities described below 
these facilities are used primarily for the issuance of letters of credit  although a portion of these facilities may also be used for liquidity purposes 
under the terms of certain reinsurance agreements  irrevocable letters of credit were issued on an unsecured and secured basis in the amount of million and million  respectively  at december   in respect of reported loss and unearned premium reserves 
included in the total credit facilities available to the company at december  is a million three year syndicated unsecured credit facility with the following terms i a maturity date of july   ii a million accordion feature  which enables the company to potentially increase its available credit from million to million  and iii a minimum consolidated tangible net worth requirement 
the company s ability to increase its available credit to million is subject to the agreement of the credit facility participants 
the company s breach of any of the covenants would result in an event of default  upon which the company may be required to repay any outstanding borrowings and replace or cash collateralize letters of credit issued under this facility 
the company was in compliance with all of the covenants at december  this facility is 
table of contents predominantly used for the issuance of letters of credit  although the company and its subsidiaries have access to a revolving line of credit of up to million as part of this facility 
during the year ended december   there were no borrowings under this revolving line of credit 
additionally  the syndicated unsecured credit facility allows for an adjustment to the level of pricing should the company experience a change in its senior unsecured debt ratings 
the pricing grid provides the company greater flexibility and simultaneously provides participants under the facility with some price protection 
on november   the company entered into an agreement to modify an existing credit facility 
under the terms of the agreement  this credit facility was increased from a million to a million combined credit facility  with the first million being unsecured and any utilization above the million being secured 
this credit facility was renewed on november  and matures on november  in addition to the unsecured credit facilities available  the company maintains committed secured letter of credit facilities 
these facilities are used for the issuance of letters of credit  which must be fully secured with cash and or government bonds and or investment grade bonds 
the agreements include default covenants  which could require the company to fully secure the outstanding letters of credit to the extent that the facility is not already fully secured  and disallow the issuance of any new letters of credit 
included in the company s secured credit facilities at december  is a million credit facility which matures on december  and a million credit facility which matures on december  at december   no conditions of default existed under these facilities 
currency the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
the company has exposure to foreign currency risk due to both its ownership of its irish  french and canadian subsidiaries and branches  whose functional currencies are the euro and the canadian dollar  and to underwriting reinsurance exposures  collecting premiums and paying claims and other operating expenses in currencies other than the us dollar and holding certain net assets in such currencies  where the company s most significant foreign currency exposure is to the euro 
at december   the value of the us dollar weakened against most major currencies compared to december   which resulted in an increase in the us dollar value of the assets and liabilities denominated in non us dollar currencies 
see results of operations and review of net income loss above for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange and net foreign exchange gains and losses during the years ended december   and the foreign exchange gain or loss resulting from the translation of the company s subsidiaries and branches financial statements expressed in euro or canadian dollar functional currency into us dollars is classified in the currency translation adjustment account  which is a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in shareholders equity 
the currency translation adjustment account increased by million during the year ended december  compared to a decrease of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  due to the translation of the company s subsidiaries and branches  whose functional currencies are the canadian dollar and the euro

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview management believes that the company is principally exposed to five types of market related risk interest rate risk  credit spread risk  foreign currency risk  counterparty credit risk and equity price risk 
how these risks relate to the company  and the process used to manage them  is discussed below 
as discussed above in this report  the company s investment philosophy distinguishes between assets that are generally matched against the estimated net reinsurance liabilities liability funds and those assets that represent shareholder capital capital funds 
liability funds are invested in a way that generally matches them to the corresponding liabilities in both duration and currency composition to provide a natural hedge against changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company s investment philosophy is to reduce foreign currency risk on capital funds by investing primarily in us dollar denominated investments 
in considering the market risk of capital funds  it is important to recognize the benefits of portfolio diversification 
although these asset classes in isolation may introduce more risk into the portfolio  market forces have a tendency to influence each class in different ways and at different times 
consequently  the aggregate risk introduced by a portfolio of these assets should be less than might be estimated by summing the individual risks 
although the focus of this discussion is to identify risk exposures that impact the market value of assets alone  it is important to recognize that the risks discussed herein are significantly mitigated to the extent that the company s investment strategy allows market forces to influence the economic valuation of assets and liabilities in a way that is generally offsetting 
as described above in this report  the company s investment strategy allows the use of derivative investments  subject to strict limitations 
the company also imposes a high standard for the credit quality of counterparties in all derivative transactions and aims to diversify its counterparty credit risk exposure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report for additional information related to derivatives 

table of contents the following comments address those areas where the company believes it has exposure to material market risk in its operations 
interest rate risk the company s fixed maturity portfolio and the fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account are exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
the company manages interest rate risk on liability funds by constructing bond portfolios in which the economic impact of a general interest rate shift is comparable to the impact on the related liabilities 
this process involves matching the duration of the investment portfolio to the estimated duration of the liabilities 
for unpaid loss reserves and policy benefits related to non life and traditional life business  the estimated duration of the company s liabilities is based on projected claims payout patterns 
for policy benefits related to annuity business  the company estimates duration based on its commitment to annuitants 
the company believes that this matching process mitigates the overall interest rate risk on an economic basis 
the company manages the exposure to interest rate volatility on capital funds by choosing a duration profile that it believes will optimize the risk reward relationship 
while this matching of duration insulates the company from the economic impact of interest rate changes  changes in interest rates do impact the company s shareholders equity 
the company s liabilities are carried at their nominal value  and are not adjusted for changes in interest rates  with the exception of certain policy benefits for life and annuity contracts and deposit liabilities that are interest rate sensitive 
however  substantially all of the company s invested assets including the investments underlying the funds held directly managed account are carried at fair value  which reflects such changes 
as a result  an increase in interest rates will result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s investments including the investments underlying the funds held directly managed account and a corresponding decrease  net of applicable taxes  in the company s shareholders equity 
a decrease in interest rates would have the opposite effect 
at december   the company held approximately  million of its total invested assets in mortgage asset backed securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  the adverse impact of which is more evident in a declining interest rate environment 
at december   the company estimates that the hypothetical case of an immediate basis points or basis points parallel shift in global bond curves would result in a change in the fair value of investments exposed to interest rate risk  the fair value of funds held directly managed account exposed to interest rate risk  total invested assets  and shareholders equity as follows in millions of us dollars basis points change basis points change december  basis points change basis points change fair value of investments exposed to interest rate risk fair value of funds held directly managed account exposed to interest rate risk total invested assets shareholders equity includes certain other invested assets  certain cash and cash equivalents and funds holding fixed income securities 
excludes accrued interest 
includes total investments  cash and cash equivalents  the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account and accrued interest 

table of contents the changes do not take into account any potential mitigating impact from the equity market  taxes or the corresponding change in the economic value of the company s reinsurance liabilities  which  as noted above  would substantially offset the economic impact on invested assets  although the offset would not be reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
as discussed above  the company strives to match the foreign currency exposure in its fixed income portfolio to its multicurrency liabilities 
the company believes that this matching process creates a diversification benefit 
consequently  the exact market value effect of a change in interest rates will depend on which countries experience interest rate changes and the foreign currency mix of the company s fixed maturity portfolio at the time of the interest rate changes 
see foreign currency risk below 
the impact of an immediate change in interest rates on the fair value of investments and funds held directly managed exposed to interest rate risk  the company s total invested assets and shareholders equity  in both absolute terms and as a percentage of total invested assets and shareholders equity  has not changed significantly at december  compared to december  interest rate movements also affect the economic value of the company s outstanding debt obligations and preferred securities in the same way that they affect the company s fixed maturity investments  and this can result in a liability whose economic value is different from the carrying value reported in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company believes that the economic fair value of its outstanding senior notes  cents and preferred shares at december  was as follows in millions of us dollars carrying value fair value debt related to senior notes debt related to capital efficient notes series c cumulative preferred shares series d cumulative preferred shares series e cumulative preferred shares partnerre finance a llc and partnerre finance b llc  the issuers of the senior notes  do not meet consolidation requirements under us gaap 
accordingly  the company shows the related intercompany debt of million in its consolidated balance sheets at december  and partnerre finance ii inc  the issuer of the cents  does not meet consolidation requirements under us gaap 
accordingly  the company shows the related intercompany debt of million in its consolidated balance sheets at december  and the fair value of the debt related to senior notes issued by partnerre finance b llc  partnerre finance a llc and the cents was calculated based on discounted cash flow models using observable market yields and contractual cash flows based on the aggregate principal amount outstanding of million from partnerre finance b llc  million from partnerre finance a and million from partnerre finance ii  respectively 
for the company s series c  series d and series e cumulative preferred shares  fair value is based on quoted market prices  while carrying value is based on the aggregate liquidation value of the shares 
the fair value of the company s outstanding debt obligations increased at december   compared to december  primarily as a result of lower risk free rates 
the fair value of the company s preferred securities has not changed significantly at december   compared to december  see shareholders equity and capital resources management shareholders equity above for a discussion of the issuance of series f non cumulative preferred shares and the announcement of the redemption of the series c preferred shares in february the redemption is expected to occur in march 
table of contents credit spread risk the company s fixed maturity portfolio and the fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account are exposed to credit spread risk 
fluctuations in market credit spreads have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
the company manages credit spread risk by the selection of securities within its fixed maturity portfolio 
changes in credit spreads directly affect the market value of certain fixed maturity securities  but do not necessarily result in a change in the future expected cash flows associated with holding individual securities 
other factors  including liquidity  supply and demand  and changing risk preferences of investors  may affect market credit spreads without any change in the underlying credit quality of the security 
as with interest rates  changes in credit spreads impact the shareholders equity of the company as invested assets are carried at fair value  which includes changes in credit spreads 
as a result  an increase in credit spreads will result in a decrease in the fair value of the company s investments including the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account and a corresponding decrease  net of applicable taxes  in the company s shareholders equity 
a decrease in credit spreads would have the opposite effect 
at december   the company estimates that the hypothetical case of an immediate basis points or basis points parallel shift in global credit spreads would result in a change in the fair value of investments and the fair value of funds held directly managed account exposed to credit spread risk  total invested assets and shareholders equity as follows in millions of us dollars basis points change basis points change december  basis points change basis points change fair value of investments exposed to credit spread risk fair value of funds held directly managed account exposed to credit spread risk total invested assets shareholders equity includes certain other invested assets  certain cash and cash equivalents and funds holding fixed income securities 
excludes accrued interest 
includes total investments  cash and cash equivalents  the investment portfolio underlying the funds held directly managed account and accrued interest 
the changes above also do not take into account any potential mitigating impact from the equity market  taxes  and the change in the economic value of the company s reinsurance liabilities  which may offset the economic impact on invested assets 
the impact of an immediate change in credit spreads on the fair value of investments and funds held directly managed exposed to credit spread risk  the company s total invested assets and shareholders equity  in both absolute terms and as a percentage of total invested assets and shareholders equity  has not changed significantly at december  compared to december  foreign currency risk through its multinational reinsurance operations  the company conducts business in a variety of non us currencies  with the principal exposures being the euro  canadian dollar  british pound  new zealand dollar  australian dollar  swiss franc and japanese yen 
as the company s reporting currency is the us dollar  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the company is generally able to match its liability funds against its net reinsurance liabilities both by currency and duration to protect the company against foreign exchange and interest rate risks 
however  a natural offset does not exist for all currencies 
for the non us dollar currencies for which the company deems the net asset or liability exposures to be material  the company employs a hedging strategy utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments  as appropriate  to reduce exposure and more appropriately match the liability funds by currency 
the company does not hedge currencies for which its asset or liability exposures are not material or where it is unable or impractical to do so 
in such cases  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk 
however  the company does not believe that the foreign currency risks corresponding to these unhedged positions are material  except for those related to the company s capital funds 
for the company s capital funds  including its net investment in foreign subsidiaries and branches  the company does not typically employ hedging strategies 
however  from time to time the company does enter into net investment hedges to offset foreign exchange volatility see currency in item of part ii of this report

at december   the company s net foreign currency exposure in its consolidated balance sheet  after the effect of derivatives  was million 
the company s most significant net foreign currency exposure at december  was to the canadian dollar which reflects the unhedged net investment in its canadian branches 
the increase of million in the company s net foreign currency exposure to million at december  compared to million at december  is primarily related to an increase in the company s net foreign currency exposure to the australian dollar  japanese yen and new zealand dollar

counterparty credit risk the company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed maturity securities 
the company controls this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed maturity securities it purchases 
at december   approximately of the company s fixed maturity portfolio including the 
table of contents funds held directly managed account and funds holding fixed income securities was rated aa or equivalent rating or better 
the decline in the percentage of the company s fixed maturity portfolio rated aa or better from at december  largely reflects standard poor s decision in january to downgrade certain european sovereign government securities  as discussed in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources investments above 
at december   approximately the company s fixed maturity and short term investments including funds holding fixed income securities and excluding the funds held directly managed account was rated a or better and was rated below investment grade or not rated

to mitigate this risk  the company monitors its exposure by counterparty  aims to diversify its counterparty credit risk and ensures that counterparties to these contracts are high credit quality international banks or counterparties 
these contracts are generally of short duration approximately days and settle on a net basis  which means that the company is exposed to the movement of one currency against the other  as opposed to the notional amount of the contracts
