overview we are a supplier of automotive and heavy duty truck replacement parts and fasteners  and service line products primarily for the automotive aftermarket 
we market approximately  sku s many of which we design and engineer 
these sku s are sold under our various brand names  under our customers private label brands or in bulk 
we believe we are the dominant aftermarket supplier of original equipment dealer exclusive items 
original equipment dealer exclusive parts are those parts which were traditionally available to consumers only from original equipment manufacturers or salvage yards 
these parts include  among other parts  intake manifolds  exhaust manifolds  oil cooler lines  window regulators  radiator fan assemblies  power steering pulleys  harmonic balancers  tire pressure monitor sensors  and keyless entry devices 
we generate over of our revenues from customers in the north american automotive aftermarket  primarily in the united states and canada 
our products are sold through automotive aftermarket retailers  national  regional and local warehouse distributors and specialty markets  and salvage yards 
we distribute automotive replacement parts outside the united states  with sales into europe  mexico  the middle east and asia 

table of contents executive overview we achieved record net sales and net income in net sales from continuing operations increased over levels to million  while net income from continuing operations increased to million 
we believe our strong financial results have been driven by favorable industry dynamics  sales growth resulting from new product sales  continued investments in new product development and a commitment to process improvements 
the automotive aftermarket has benefited from some of the factors affecting the general economy  including the impact of the recent recession  continued high unemployment  and high gas prices 
we believe vehicle owners have become more likely to keep their current vehicles longer and perform necessary repairs and maintenance in order to keep those vehicles well maintained as a result of these factors 
according to data published by the automotive aftermarket industry association in  the average age of vehicles on the road was years as of december another important statistic that impacts our business is the number of miles driven  which has remained essentially flat since however  the combination of vehicle age and miles driven accounts for a portion of our sales growth 
the overall automotive aftermarket in which we compete has benefited from the conditions mentioned above 
however  our customer base has consolidated in recent years 
as a result  our customers regularly seek more favorable pricing  product returns and extended payment terms when negotiating with us 
we attempt to avoid or minimize these concessions as much as possible  but we have granted pricing concessions  increased customer payment terms and allowed higher level of product returns in certain cases 
these concessions impact our profit levels and may require additional capital to finance the business 
we expect our customers to continue to exert pressure on our margins as the customer base continues to consolidate 
we rely on new product development as a way to offset some of these customer demands and as our primary vehicle for growth 
as such  new product development is a critical success factor for us 
we have made incremental investments to increase our new product development efforts each year since in an effort to grow our business and strengthen our relationships with our customers 
the investments are primarily in the form of increased product development resources  increased customer and end user awareness programs and customer service improvements 
these investments have enabled us to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow revenues at levels that exceed market growth rates 
in  we introduced a new line of products to be marketed for the medium and heavy duty truck aftermarket 
we believe that this market provides many of the same opportunities for growth that the automotive aftermarket has provided us over the past several years 
our focus here will be on formerly dealer only parts as it is on the automotive side of the business 
we launched the initial program with a limited offering  but have made additional investments in new product development efforts to expand our product offering 
we currently have over sku s in our medium and heavy duty product line 
revenues from this product line were less than of our net sales in we may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in our results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by our customers 
generally  the second and third quarters have the highest level of customer orders 
the introduction of new products and product lines to customers may cause significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
we operate on a fifty two  fifty three week period ended on the last saturday of the calendar year 
the fiscal years ended december  and december  were fifty two week periods 
the fiscal year ended december  was a fifty three week period 
discontinued operations on september   we announced our plan to exit the international portion of our scantech business due to continued operating losses and to focus on growing our north american business 
scantech was headquartered outside stockholm  sweden and distributed a line of volvo and saab replacement parts throughout the world 
scantech s results of operations have been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statement of operations 
asset write downs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that certain acquired intangible assets were impaired 
as such  we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal to fully write off these assets 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations percentage of net sales years ended december  december  december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income from continuing operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased over the prior year to million from million last year 
excluding the impact of an additional million in sales due to a fifty third week in fiscal  revenues increased over fiscal levels 
our revenue growth continues to be driven by overall strong demand for our products and higher new product sales 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in the same period last year 
lower transportation costs contributed approximately one half of the difference 
the remaining variance was primarily the result of a favorable sales mix towards higher margin products  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory which were million lower in fiscal than in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the spending increase in fiscal was primarily the result of approximately million of increased payroll expenses as we continue to invest in additional product management and other resources to support our product development and growth efforts  million of higher incentive compensation expenses and million of increased financing costs associated with our accounts receivable sales programs 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales from of net sales as we continue to leverage our expenses over growing net sales 
interest expense  net  was million in fiscal and fiscal our effective tax rate increased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was favorably impacted by the receipt of tax exempt life insurance proceeds to fund an officer s death benefit 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our revenue growth was driven by overall strong demand for our products  higher new product sales and the impact of one additional week s sales in fiscal excluding the additional one week of sales  net sales growth was in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal provisions for excess and obsolete inventory were million higher in fiscal than in fiscal also  higher product returns costs and an unfavorable change in sales mix each resulted in approximately one half of the remaining variance 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the spending increase in fiscal was primarily the result of approximately million of increased payroll expenses related to investments in product management and other resources and million of increased financing costs associated with our accounts receivable sales programs which was partially offset by million of lower incentive compensation expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to write off certain intangible assets 

table of contents interest expense  net  was million in fiscal and fiscal our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to the effect of lower provisions for state income taxes and the fiscal receipt of tax exempt life insurance proceeds used to fund an officer s death benefit 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through a combination of cash flow from operations  accounts receivable sales programs provided by certain customers and through the issuance of senior indebtedness through our bank credit facility and senior note agreements 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  decreased to million from million as of december  due to our special cash dividend paid in december working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  we had no long term debt or borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  or december  shareholders equity was million at december  compared to million at december  over the past several years we have continued to extend payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands 
these extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash flow 
we participate in accounts receivable sales programs with several customers which allow us to sell our accounts receivable to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these payment terms extensions 
during fiscal and fiscal  we sold approximately million and million  respectively  under these programs 
we expect continued pressure to extend our payment terms for the foreseeable future 
further extensions of customer payment terms will result in additional uses of cash flow or increased costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable 
we have a million revolving credit facility which expires in june borrowings under the facility are on an unsecured basis with interest at rates ranging from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points based upon the achievement of certain benchmarks related to the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the interest rate at december  was libor plus basis points 
there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  as of december   we had three letters of credit for approximately million in the aggregate which were issued to secure ordinary course of business transactions 
we had approximately million available under the facility at december   net of these letters of credit 
the loan agreement also contains covenants  the most restrictive of which pertain to net worth and the ratio of debt to ebitda 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements our business activities do not include the use of unconsolidated special purpose entities  and there are no significant business transactions that have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have future obligations for future minimum rental and similar commitments under noncancellable operating leases as well as contingent obligations related to outstanding letters of credit 
these obligations as of december  are summarized in the tables below in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amount committed less than year years years after years letters of credit we have excluded from the table above unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty of the amount and period of payment 
as of december   the company has gross unrecognized tax benefits of million see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents cash flows below is a table setting forth the key lines of our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands december  december  december  cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities in fiscal increased by million compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in net income which was partially offset by a million non cash foreign exchange gain resulting from the substantial liquidation of our scantech subsidiary in fiscal and million increase in working capital needs in fiscal due to our growth during the periods of fiscal and fiscal  accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable increased 
cash provided by operating activities in fiscal increased by million compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in net income in fiscal compared to fiscal also  due to our growth over the periods of fiscal and fiscal  accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable increased 
investing activities used million of cash in both fiscal and fiscal  and million in fiscal as a result of additions to property  plant and equipment 
capital spending in each period was related to the following significant projects in the third quarter of fiscal  we began a project to replace our enterprise resource planning erp system 
this project is expected to cost between million and million for capitalized software  installation services and internal costs through through december   we have spent million on the project  of which million was spent in fiscal  was spent in fiscal and million was spent in fiscal the installation of the new erp was completed at our allparts  inc subsidiary in january no disruption to our operations is anticipated 
during fiscal  we completed the expansion of our distribution facility in warsaw  kentucky 
we spent million on this project in fiscal and million in fiscal the remaining spending in each period was related to tooling associated with new products  scheduled equipment replacements and other capital projects 
cash used by financing activities increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal on december  we announced a special cash dividend of per share payable on december  to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  total cash payments resulting from this dividend were million in fiscal the remaining sources and uses of cash from financing activities in each period result from stock option activity and the repurchase of common stock from our k plan 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our sources of available capital are adequate to meet our ongoing cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal  approximately of our products were purchased from vendors in a variety of foreign countries 
the products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product 
to the extent that the dollar decreases in value relative to foreign currencies in the future  the price of the product in dollars for new purchase orders may increase 
the largest portion of our overseas purchases comes from china 
since june  the value of the chinese yuan has increased approximately relative to the us dollar 
a continued increase in the value of the yuan relative to the us dollar will likely result in an increase in the cost of products that we purchase from china 

table of contents impact of inflation the overall impact of inflation has not resulted in a significant change in labor costs or the cost of general services utilized 
the cost of many commodities that are used in our products has fluctuated over time resulting in increases and decreases in the prices of our products 
in addition  we have periodically experienced increased transportation costs as a result of higher fuel prices 
we will attempt to offset cost increases by passing along selling price increases to customers  using alternative suppliers and by resourcing purchases to other countries 
however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
related party transactions we have a noncancelable operating lease for our primary operating facility from a partnership in which steven l 
berman  our chairman and chief executive officer  and his family members are partners 
total annual rental payments each year to the partnership under the lease arrangement was million in fiscal and was million in fiscal and fiscal our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions 
in the opinion of our audit committee  the terms and rates of this lease are no less favorable than those which could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  customer credits  inventories  goodwill and income taxes 
estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be accurate and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates due to different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a significant percentage of our accounts receivable have been  and will continue to be  concentrated among a relatively small number of automotive retailers and warehouse distributors in the united states 
our five largest customers accounted for and of net accounts receivable as of december  and december   respectively 
a bankruptcy or financial loss associated with a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
revenue recognition and allowance for customer credits 
revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
we record estimates for cash discounts  product returns and warranties  discounts and promotional rebates in the period of the sale customer credits 
the provision for customer credits is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and reserves for customer credits are shown as a reduction of accounts receivable 
actual customer credits have not differed materially from estimated amounts for each period presented 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we must make estimates of potential future excess and obsolete inventory costs 
we provide reserves for discontinued and excess inventory based upon historical demand  forecasted usage  estimated customer requirements and product line updates 
we maintain contact with our customer base in order to understand buying patterns  customer preferences and the life cycle of our products 
changes in customer requirements are factored into the reserves as needed 
goodwill 
we assess the qualitative factors which could affect the fair values of our reporting units 
during fiscal and we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of each reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 
income taxes 
we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  
table of contents assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes takes into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset takes into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates 
new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements refer to note  new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements  to the notes of consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
substantially all of our available credit and accounts receivable sale programs bear interest rates tied to libor 
under the terms of our revolving credit facility and customer sponsored programs to sell accounts receivable  a change in either the lender s base rate  libor or discount rates under the accounts receivable sale programs would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds thereunder 
a one percentage point increase in libor or the discount rates on the accounts receivable sale programs would increase our interest expense on our variable rate debt  if any  and accounts receivable financing costs by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal this estimate assumes that our variable rate debt balance and the level of sales of accounts receivable remains constant for an annual period and the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what actually occurs in the future 
we have historically and do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
we are not exposed to any significant market risks  foreign currency exchange risks  or interest rate risks from the use of derivative instruments 
we did not hold any foreign exchange forward contracts at december  at december   we had two foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward million swedish krona to receive approximately million 
the fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of approximately  at december
