item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 
investments held by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with the insurance laws and regulations of their state of domicile 
our primary insurance subsidiary is domiciled in washington state 
during  washington state law changed to increase the percentage of assets we are able to invest in foreign securities to  from  of statutory admitted assets 
as a result  we began to increase our investments in high quality foreign securities and intend to continue to increase our foreign holdings during we have contracted with professional investment advisers to invest our assets  other than our commercial mortgage portfolio  which is managed by our internal commercial mortgage loan department 
white mountains advisors llc  a related party  and its subadvisers manages the majority of our investment portfolio  including our fixed maturities  limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts reits 
our equity focused portfolio  composed primarily of common stock and convertible securities is managed by prospector partners  llc  or prospector 
for each of our asset intensive operating segments and for our unallocated surplus  we separate our investments into one or more distinct portfolios 
our investment strategy for each portfolio is based on the expected cash flow characteristics of the liabilities associated with the portfolio 
the portfolio strategies are regularly monitored through a review of portfolio metrics  such as effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality 

table of contents in general  we purchase high quality assets to pursue the following investment strategies for our segments benefits 
we invest in short duration fixed income corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities 
deferred annuities 
we invest in short to medium duration fixed income corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage loans and a modest amount of below investment grade bonds 
income annuities 
the income annuities segment has liability payments that extend well beyond years 
the majority of the segment s portfolio is invested in long duration fixed income corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage loans  and a modest amount of below investment grade bonds 
in addition  we invest in equities  including common stocks and reits  to support a portion of the liability payments due more than years in the future 
individual life 
we invest in medium to long duration fixed income corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage loans and a modest amount of below investment grade bonds 
other 
we invest in short to long duration fixed income assets and equities  commercial mortgage loans  limited partnerships and a modest amount of below investment grade bonds 
we are exposed to four primary sources of investment risk credit risk risk relating to the continued ability of a given obligor or borrower to make timely payments of principal and interest  as well as risk relating to us holding commercial real estate in the event of a mortgage loan foreclosure  interest rate and credit spread risk risk relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves and credit spreads  illiquidity risk risk relating to our ability to convert certain investments to cash  including commercial mortgage loans and private placement securities  which are relatively illiquid regardless of market conditions  and equity risk risk relating to adverse fluctuations in a particular common stock or equity markets in general 
in addition  we hold a small portfolio of foreign currency denominated investments  primarily consisting of million of fixed maturities as of december  as we expand these holdings  our exposure to foreign currency risk  or the risk related to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency  may increase 
we plan to continue to manage this risk through derivatives 
our ability to manage investment risks while generating an appropriate investment return is essential to our business and our profitability 
we manage credit risk by analyzing issuers  transaction structures and  for our commercial mortgage portfolio  real estate properties 
we use analytic techniques to monitor credit risk 
for example  we regularly measure the probability of credit default and estimated loss in the event of such a default  which provides us with early notification of worsening credit 
if an issuer downgrade causes our holdings of that issuer to exceed our risk thresholds  we automatically undertake a detailed review of the issuer s credit 
we also manage credit risk through industry and issuer diversification 
for commercial mortgage loans  we manage credit risk by analyzing the market value and revenue generating potential of the property  as well as the credit worthiness of the borrower and by using shorter amortization structures 
we diversify our credit risk by both geographic location and property type  and generally use personal recourse to further reduce our risk of loss 
we routinely review the financial statements of our borrowers and the underlying properties 
we mitigate interest rate risk through management of cash flow and duration matches between our assets and liabilities  seeking to reduce risk of realized loss in both rising and falling interest rate environments 

table of contents we mitigate equity risk by limiting the size of our equity portfolio 
we align our equity exposure in our income annuities segment to our long duration obligations 
we review the ability of our capital base to absorb downside volatility without creating capital ratio stress and or constraints on growth 
we invest in relatively concentrated positions in the united states and other developed markets 
the investments are identified using a bottom up fundamental analysis and value oriented investment approach 
in connection with certain products and investments  we use a variety of strategies to manage the associated risks  including the use of derivative instruments  primarily options  interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps and forwards 
we have established policies for managing each of these risks  including prohibitions on derivatives market making and other speculative derivatives activities 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
reinsurance we engage in the industry practice of reinsuring portions of our insurance risk with reinsurance companies through both automatic and facultative reinsurance agreements 
in a reinsurance transaction  a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium 
we use reinsurance to diversify our risks and manage loss exposures primarily in our benefits and individual life divisions  to write policies in amounts larger than the risk we are willing to retain  to improve our results by leveraging favorable reinsurance pricing and to provide additional capacity for future growth 
we cede insurance risk primarily on a treaty basis  under which risks are ceded to a reinsurer on specific books of business where the underlying risks meet certain predetermined criteria 
to a lesser extent  we cede insurance risks on a facultative basis  under which the reinsurer s prior approval is required on each risk reinsured 
the use of reinsurance does not discharge us  as the insurer  from liability on the insurance ceded 
we  as the insurer  are required to pay the full amount of our insurance obligations even in circumstances where we are entitled or able to receive payments from our reinsurer 
we obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers  and we monitor concentration and financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers 
we had reinsurance recoverables of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   our largest reinsurer  rga reinsurance company  represented of the overall recoverable  and had an am best rating of a 
under various treaties  rga reinsures the risk of a large loss on certain term life  universal life and medical stop loss insurance policies  and provides reinsurance related to group life insurance products offered by our benefits segment  including catastrophe coverage 
for more information regarding our risks in using reinsurance arrangements  see the discussion of our divisions and segments and item a risk factors 
for more information regarding our reinsurance recoverable  see note to the consolidated financial statements  respectively 
operations and technology we have a dedicated team of service and support personnel  as well as our outsourced it infrastructure provider xerox business services  llc or xerox formerly affiliated computer services  inc that deliver information technology solutions to drive competitive advantages  achieve earnings growth objectives and control the cost of doing business 
we mainly follow a buy versus build approach in providing application and business processing services that accelerate delivery and responsiveness 
we also develop proprietary software for competitive or economic benefits 
under the terms of our agreement with xerox we may terminate our services prior to the july contract expiration date upon days notice and payment of a million termination fee 
the termination fee declines over the life of the contract  and is pro rated based upon the services that are terminated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this third party service agreement 

table of contents financial strength ratings rating organizations continually review the financial performance and condition of most insurers and provide financial strength ratings based on a company s operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders 
ratings provide both industry participants and insurance consumers meaningful information that is an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
in addition  ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in us and our ability to market our products 
we believe that our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to our distributors and customers  since ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
maintaining our ratings may require us to retain higher levels of capital and limit our ability to execute capital actions 
our ratings reflect each rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors 
such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy  hold or sell any security  including our common stock 
symetra financial corporation and our principal life insurance subsidiaries  symetra life insurance company and first symetra national life insurance company of new york  are rated by am best  standard and poor s s p  moody s and fitch as follows  as of december  am best s p moody s fitch financial strength ratings symetra life insurance company a a a a first symetra national life insurance company of new york a a nr a issuer credit default ratings symetra financial corporation bbb bbb baa a symetra life insurance company a a nr nr first symetra national life insurance company of new york a a nr nr nr indicates not rated am best states that its a excellent financial strength rating is assigned to those companies that have  in its opinion  an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders

am best describes its a issuer credit rating for insurers as excellent  assigned to those companies that have  in its opinion  a strong ability to meet the terms of their ongoing senior financial obligations 
its bbb issuer credit rating is described as good  assigned to those companies that have  in its opinion  an adequate ability to meet the terms of their obligations but are more susceptible to changes in economic or other conditions 
am best issuer credit ratings range from aaa exceptional to rs regulatory supervision liquidation and may be enhanced with a plus or minus to indicate whether credit quality is near the top or bottom of a category 
symetra life insurance company and first symetra national life insurance company of new york s financial size category  or fsc  rankings  as determined by am best  are both xv  the highest of rankings 
am best indicates that the fsc is designed to provide an indicator of the size of a company in terms of its statutory surplus and related accounts 
standard poor s states that an insurer with a financial strength rating of a strong has strong financial security characteristics that outweigh any vulnerabilities  and is highly likely to have the ability to meet financial commitments  but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings 
the a range is the third highest of the four ratings ranges that meet these criteria  and also is the third highest of nine financial strength ratings ranges assigned by s p  which range from aaa to r 
a plus or minus shows relative standing in a rating category

table of contents describes companies assigned an a issuer credit rating as having a strong capacity to meet financial commitments  but somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than higher rated companies 
companies assigned a bbb issuer credit rating have adequate capacity to meet financial commitments  but adverse economic conditions are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to meet such commitments 
moody s investors service states that insurance companies rated a good offer good financial security 
however  elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future 
the a range is the third highest of nine financial strength rating ranges assigned by moody s which range from aaa to c 
numeric modifiers are used to refer to the ranking within the group  with being the highest and being the lowest 
accordingly  the a rating is the seventh highest of moody s ratings categories 
moody s credit rating is assigned to our senior debt 
a rating of baa is defined as subject to moderate credit risk  considered medium grade  and may possess certain speculative characteristics 
fitch states that insurance companies with a financial strength rating of a strong are viewed as possessing strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations 
risk factors are moderate  and the impact of any adverse business and economic factors is expected to be small 
the a rating category is the third highest of nine financial strength categories  which range from aaa to c 
the symbol or may be appended to a rating to indicate the relative position of a credit within a rating category 
these suffixes are not added to ratings in the aaa category or to ratings below the ccc category 
accordingly  the a rating is the fifth highest of fitch s financial strength ratings categories 
fitch issuer default ratings range from aaa highest credit quality to d default 
fitch describes its a issuer default rating as high credit quality  which denotes an expectation of low default risk  but may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than higher ratings 
am best  s p  moody s and fitch review their ratings periodically and we cannot provide assurance that we will maintain our current ratings in the future 
other agencies may rate symetra or our insurance subsidiaries on a solicited or unsolicited basis 
regulation our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations 
state insurance laws and regulations govern most aspects of our insurance businesses  and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed 
our insurance products  and thus our businesses  also are affected by federal  state and local tax laws 
we are also subject to state regulation with respect to laws and public policies governing unclaimed property  which includes unclaimed death benefits on life and annuity policies 
variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts variable contracts issued by our insurance subsidiaries are securities and unless offered pursuant to an exemption  are registered as such under the securities act of the act 
as a result  the securities and exchange commission sec regulates their offer and sale 
in addition  most such variable contracts are issued through separate accounts that are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of the act and our broker dealers that underwrite or sell the contracts are registered under the securities exchange act of the act 
the sec regulates both registered investment companies and broker dealers and the financial industry regulatory authority  inc finra also regulates our broker dealers and indirectly the offer and sale of our variable contracts 
the purpose of the laws and regulations affecting our insurance and securities businesses is primarily to protect our customers and not our noteholders or stockholders 
many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re examined  and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
in addition  insurance and securities regulatory authorities make inquiries of us regarding compliance with insurance  securities and other laws and regulations 
we cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted 

table of contents many of our customers and agents are also sensitive to changes in regulations that may affect their ability or desire to purchase or distribute our products 
insurance regulation our insurance subsidiaries are licensed and regulated in all states in which they conduct insurance business and all forms and rates are filed for approval in states where required 
the extent of this regulation varies  but most states have laws and regulations governing the financial condition of insurers  including standards of solvency  types and concentration of investments  establishment and maintenance of reserves  credit for reinsurance and requirements of capital adequacy  and the business conduct of insurers  including marketing and sales practices and claims handling 
state insurance departments monitor our market conduct by examining our policies  procedures and practices from time to time through market conduct examinations and or market analysis 
similarly  claims handling policies  procedures and practices are monitored by the states through claims examinations 
in addition  statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents  the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates for certain lines of insurance 
the types of insurance laws and regulations applicable to us or our insurance subsidiaries are described below 
insurance holding company regulation all states in which our insurance subsidiaries conduct insurance business have enacted legislation that requires each insurance company in a holding company system  except captive insurance companies  to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile and to furnish that regulatory authority financial and other information concerning the operations of  and the interrelationships and transactions among  companies within its holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
these laws and regulations also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their parents and affiliates 
generally  these laws and regulations require that all transactions within a holding company system between an insurer and its affiliates be fair and reasonable and that the insurer s statutory surplus following any transaction with an affiliate be both reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate in relation to its financial needs 
statutory surplus is the excess of admitted assets over statutory liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of statutory basis information 
for certain types of agreements and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates  these laws and regulations require prior notification to  and approval or non disapproval by  the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer s state of domicile 
policy forms our insurance subsidiaries policy forms are subject to regulation in every state in which such policies are offered 
in most states  policy forms must be filed and  in most cases  approved prior to their use 
dividend limitations as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own  symetra depends on dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries as the principal source of cash to meet its obligations  including the payment of interest on and repayment of principal of any debt obligations and payment of dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases 
the payment of dividends or other distributions to symetra by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile 
in the state of washington  the state of domicile of symetra s principal insurance subsidiary  symetra life insurance company  an insurance company subsidiary may not pay an extraordinary dividend or distribution until days after the insurance commissioner has received sufficient notice of the intended payment and has approved or not objected to the payment within the day period 
an extraordinary dividend or distribution is defined under washington law as a dividend or distribution that  together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurer s statutory surplus as of the immediately prior year end  or the statutory net gain from the insurer s operations for the prior year 

table of contents state laws and regulations also prohibit an insurer from declaring or paying a dividend except out of its statutory surplus or require the insurer to obtain regulatory approval before it may do so 
in addition  insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to symetra such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services if they determine that such payment could be adverse to policyholders or contract holders 
statutory examinations as part of their regulatory oversight process  state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books  records  accounts and business practices of insurers domiciled in their jurisdictions 
these examinations generally are conducted in cooperation with the insurance departments of several other states under guidelines promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
during the three year period ended december   we have not received any material adverse findings resulting from any insurance department examinations of our insurance subsidiaries 
in february  the office of insurance commissioner of the state of washington certified routine financial examination reports of our two washington domiciled insurance companies which covered the five year period ending december  there were no examination adjustments noted in the reports and no materially adverse findings or instructions in the reports 
in  new york state department of financial services began a routine full scope market conduct and financial examination of our new york domiciled insurance company for the three year period ending december  a final report of this routine examination has not been received 
market conduct regulation as part of their oversight process  state insurance departments also conduct periodic detailed examinations of market conduct practices of insurance companies selling life insurance and annuity contracts in their jurisdictions 
these examinations cover marketplace activities of life insurers  including the form and content of advertising and other disclosures to consumers  product illustrations  suitability determinations  replacement of contracts and other sales practices  underwriting practices  handling of complaints and claims handling and processing practices 
often market conduct examinations are focused on a single or a few practices that are of particular interest to state insurance departments 
market conduct examinations may be conducted by one state insurance department  or by departments of several states acting jointly 
in late  symetra received notice from the california department of insurance that the department was initiating a market conduct examination of symetra s life insurance companies  focused on their life insurance and annuity claims settlement practices  including practices related to the handling of unclaimed property 
the california department has indicated that it is conducting this examination on behalf of itself and several other states  including the state of washington 
the start date of this examination has not yet been determined 
guaranty associations and similar arrangements most states require life insurers that write insurance within the state to participate in guaranty associations  which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies of insurers who become impaired or insolvent 
in the event of an insolvency  these associations levy assessments  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer is engaged 
some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 
change of control the laws and regulations of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require that a person obtain the approval of the insurance commissioner of the insurance company s jurisdiction of domicile prior to acquiring control of the insurer 
generally  such laws provide that control over an insurer is presumed to 
table of contents exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing or more of the voting securities of the insurer 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control involving us  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable 
policy and contract reserve sufficiency analysis under the laws and regulations of their states of domicile  our life insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct annual analyses of the sufficiency of their life and health insurance and annuity statutory reserves 
in addition  other jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries are licensed may have certain reserve requirements that differ from those of their domiciliary jurisdictions 
in each case  a qualified actuary must submit an opinion that states that the aggregate statutory reserves  when considered in light of the assets held with respect to such reserves  make good and sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer 
if such an opinion cannot be provided  the affected insurer must set up additional reserves by moving funds from surplus 
our life insurance subsidiaries submit these opinions annually to applicable insurance regulatory authorities 
for further information on the results of our statutory reserve adequacy analysis  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
surplus and capital requirements insurance regulators have the discretionary authority  in connection with the ongoing licensing of our insurance subsidiaries  to limit or prohibit the ability of an insurer to issue new policies if  in the regulators judgment  the insurer is not maintaining a minimum amount of surplus or is in hazardous financial condition 
insurance regulators may also limit the ability of an insurer to issue new life insurance policies and annuity contracts above an amount based upon the face amount and premiums of policies of a similar type issued in the prior year 
we do not believe that the current or anticipated levels of statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries present a material risk that any such regulator would limit the amount of new policies that our insurance subsidiaries may issue 
risk based capital the naic has established risk based capital standards for life insurance companies as well as a model act with the intention that these standards be applied at the state level 
the model act provides that life insurance companies must submit an annual risk based capital report to state regulators reporting their risk based capital based upon four categories of risk asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
for each category  the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to various asset  premium and reserve items  with the factor being higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items 
the formula is intended to be used by insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action 
if an insurer s risk based capital falls below specified levels  the insurer would be subject to different degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level 
these actions range from requiring the insurer to propose actions to correct the capital deficiency to placing the insurer under regulatory control 
as of december   the risk based capital of each of our life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the level of risk based capital that would require any of them to take or become subject to any corrective action 
as of december   symetra life insurance company  our primary life insurance subsidiary  had a risk based capital ratio of  which exceeded the minimum rbc requirements of 

table of contents statutory accounting principles statutory accounting principles sap is a basis of accounting developed by state insurance regulators to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies 
in developing sap  insurance regulators were primarily concerned with assuring an insurer s ability to pay all of its current and future obligations to policyholders 
as a result  statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers  generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer s domiciliary state 
uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the naic and generally adopted by regulators in the various states 
these accounting principles and related regulations determine  among other things  the amounts our insurance subsidiaries may pay to us as dividends 
the values for assets  liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap will generally be different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under sap 
regulation of investments each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to laws and regulations that require diversification of its investment portfolio and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories  such as below investment grade fixed maturities  foreign securities  real estate  equity investments and derivatives 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus  and  in some instances  would require divestiture of such non complying investments 
we believe the investments held by our insurance subsidiaries comply with these laws and regulations 
in addition  related laws and regulations addressing insolvency of life insurance companies also may indirectly limit symetra life insurance company s ability to invest assets in certain types of derivative contracts 
federal regulation of insurance currently  the federal government does not regulate directly the business of insurance 
however  the dodd frank act created a federal insurance office 
while the federal insurance office will not directly regulate domestic insurance business  it is tasked with studying the potential efficiency and consequences of federal insurance regulation 
although the federal government does not comprehensively regulate the business of insurance  federal legislation and administrative policies in several other areas  including taxation  privacy regulation  financial services regulation  securities and pension and welfare benefits regulation  can also significantly affect the insurance industry 
from time to time  federal measures are proposed that may significantly affect the insurance business  including direct federal regulation of insurance through an optional federal charter  limitations on antitrust immunity  tax incentives for lifetime annuity payouts  simplification bills affecting tax advantaged or tax exempt savings and retirement vehicles  and the federal estate tax 
likewise  there exists uncertainties relating to the proposals and rules that have been written and yet to be written by various federal agencies as part of the implementation of the dodd frank act and ppaca  including the delegation of enforcement authority to the states for ppaca s health care reforms as applied to health insurers 
we cannot predict whether these or other proposals or rules will be adopted  or what impact  if any  such proposals or rules may have on our business 
unclaimed property laws we are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification  reporting and escheatment of abandoned or unclaimed money or property 
from time to time  the treasurers or controllers of various states and other jurisdictions  or their revenue departments  conduct audits of companies unclaimed property practices  including those of life insurance companies 

table of contents in late  symetra received notice that a private contractor would conduct such an audit of its three life insurance companies  on behalf of the treasurers  controllers  or revenue departments of several states 
we anticipate that this audit will seek to identify death benefits and other payments under life insurance and annuity contracts that have not yet been paid to beneficiaries  in order to determine whether such benefits should be escheated to the states in which deceased owners resided 
as of february  approximately states are participating in the audit 
tax laws existing federal laws and regulations provide favorable tax treatment to many insurance products we offer 
congress  from time to time  considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers  including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefits derived from the tax advantages within life insurance and annuity products 
although the recent compromise legislation  the american taxpayer relief act of  that was enacted in early largely preserves the favorable tax treatment of our insurance products  we expect that large federal deficits and debt may continue to put pressure on congress to raise revenue 
if existing federal laws and regulations are revised to reduce this favorable tax treatment or to increase the tax deferred status of competing products  we  along with other life insurance companies  will be adversely affected with respect to our ability to sell such products 
other laws and regulations securities regulation certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various levels of regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the sec 
variable contracts issued by our life insurance subsidiaries are securities 
most are registered under the act and are fully subject to the act and rules thereunder 
other variable contracts are sold in non public offerings in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the act  but are subject to its anti fraud provisions 
one of our broker dealer subsidiaries serves as principal underwriter of the variable contracts and is regulated by the sec under the act and rules thereunder as well as by finra under its rules 
another subsidiary is a full service broker dealer that is likewise subject to sec and finra regulation 
various state and local regulators also may regulate our broker dealers 
the registered representatives of both broker dealers are regulated by the sec and finra and are also subject to applicable state and local laws 
our business partners in the sale and distribution of variable contracts and other securities are likewise regulated by these laws and regulations eg  unaffiliated broker dealers that have selling agreements with our broker dealers 
certain separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries through which variable contracts are issued  as well as the symetra mutual funds trusts established in may in connection with the true va product  are registered with the sec as investment companies under the act 
both the act and the investment advisers act of the advisers act impose a complex and rigorous regulatory regime on investment companies and investment advisers 
certain separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries through which variable contracts not registered under the act are issued  are not registered as investment companies in reliance upon exclusions from the definition of an investment company found in the act 
nevertheless  certain provisions of the act apply to such separate accounts 
our recently formed investment adviser is registered with the sec under the advisers act  as is our full service broker dealer 
certain employees of our investment advisers are licensed as advisory representatives in states where those employees have clients and are subject to regulation by those states 
the laws and regulations identified above are subject to change  which may affect our subsidiaries  employees and business partners subject to them 
the last several years have seen changes in these laws and regulations and we anticipate such changes will continue 
interpreting new laws and regulations  and obtaining timely guidance about them from the applicable regulator  are often challenging 
maintaining compliance in this environment is a constant challenge and the risk of an inadvertent error or omission is ever present 
consistent with this  our costs to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations continues to increase 

table of contents the laws and regulations identified above are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant the sec and other regulators broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 
in the event of failure by our subsidiaries  employees and business partners to comply  possible sanctions that regulators may impose include censures or fines of our life insurance companies  broker dealers or investment advisers  suspension or limitation of sales of our products  suspension of individual employees or agents  limitations on the activities in which our investment advisers or broker dealers may engage  suspension or revocation of registration or licenses of our broker dealers or investment advisers  and public disclosure of our failure to comply which may damage our reputation or that of our business partners and or encourage private litigation 
employee retirement income security act and internal revenue code considerations we provide certain products and services to certain employee benefits plans that are subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa or the internal revenue code 
as such  our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by erisa and the internal revenue code  including the requirement under erisa that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of erisa plan participants and beneficiaries and the requirement under erisa and the internal revenue code that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions with persons who have certain relationships with respect to such plans 
the applicable provisions of erisa and the internal revenue code are subject to enforcement by the us department of labor  the irs and the pension benefit guaranty corporation 
privacy of consumer information us federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions  including insurance companies  to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer financial information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of consumer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
similarly  federal and state laws and regulations also govern the disclosure and security of consumer health information 
in particular  regulations promulgated by the us department of health and human services regulate the disclosure and use of protected health information by health insurers and others  the physical and procedural safeguards employed to protect the security of that information and the electronic transmission of such information 
congress and state legislatures from time to time consider additional legislation relating to privacy and other aspects of consumer information 
violation of these consumer privacy laws could result in significant penalties and adverse regulatory actions 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time and part time employees 
we believe our employee relations are satisfactory

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business fluctuations in interest rates and interest rate spreads could impact sales  profitability or cash flows of interest rate sensitive products 
certain of our insurance and investment products  such as annuities and universal life insurance  are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates may make our products less attractive to customers seeking higher yields  which could adversely impact our sales or trigger increased surrenders and withdrawals 
for example  when the initial guaranteed interest rate period for fixed annuity products expires  we may significantly decrease renewal crediting rates below the initial rates  which may impact our ability to obtain and retain business 
fluctuations in interest rates may also reduce the interest spread  or the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations and the amounts that we must credit to policyholders and contract holders  which could adversely impact the profitability of those products and therefore our results of operations 
we mitigate the risks related to fluctuations in interest rates by employing asset to liability matching strategies to help ensure that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due 
however  these strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility 
for example  on our immediate annuities we are unable to reduce contractually guaranteed payments and a decline in the investment returns on assets supporting this business would reduce our interest spread 
reductions in expected profitability or increased surrenders and withdrawals may require us to accelerate amortization of associated deferred policy acquisition costs dac  and deferred sales inducements dsi  balances  further decreasing our results of operations 
prolonged periods of low interest rates prolonged periods of low interest rates may have a negative impact on our ability to sell products that are dependent on interest earnings  such as fixed annuity and universal life products  as consumers look for other high yielding investment vehicles to fund retirement 
in low interest rate environments  such as we ve experienced during the past few years and which we expect to continue to experience for the foreseeable future  it is difficult to offer attractive rates and benefits to customers while maintaining profitability  which may limit sales growth of interest sensitive products 
sustained declines in interest may subject us to lower returns on our invested assets  and we may have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments 
this may reduce our future net investment income and compress the spread on interest rate sensitive products 
further  borrowers may prepay fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans in order to borrow at lower market rates 
any related prepayment fees are recorded in net investment income and may create income statement volatility 
this risk is exacerbated by guaranteed minimum crediting rates established by our contracts and or regulatory authorities  and restrictions on the timing and frequency with which we can adjust our crediting rates 
our interest rate spreads vary by product 
by comparing the unadjusted interest spreads to the interest spreads adjusted to remove the effect of prepayments the following table illustrates the volatility investment prepayments can have on our fixed annuity spreads for the year ended december  fixed annuities interest spread base interest spread interest spread is the difference between the net investment yield and the credited rate to policyholders 
the net investment yield is the approximate yield on invested assets in the general account attributed to the segment 
the credited rate is the approximate rate credited on policyholder fixed account values 
interest credited is subject to contractual terms  including minimum guarantees 

table of contents base interest spread is the interest spread adjusted to exclude items that can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and  therefore  may contribute to yields that are not indicative of the underlying trends 
this is primarily the impact of asset prepayments  such as bond make whole premiums  the mbs prepayment speed adjustment  and deferred sales inducement unlocking 
in addition to our fixed annuities  the performance of our long term income annuities and boli products is also sensitive to the investment yields on our invested assets backing such products 
in extreme situations  the investment yield earned could be lower than the credited rates guaranteed to the customers 
we may not be able to successfully manage interest rate spreads or the potential negative impact of those risks 
our term life insurance products also expose us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns 
over time  term life insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums  which we invest as received 
lower than expected interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins on these products 
we mitigate some of the aforementioned risks by reducing guaranteed minimum crediting rates offered on new business and  for our deferred annuity products  lowering up front commissions 
however  sustained low interest rates may require us to suspend offerings of certain products 
periods of rising interest rates we are also subject to risks associated with periods of rising interest rates 
during such times  we may offer higher crediting rates on new sales of interest sensitive products and increase crediting rates on existing in force products to maintain or enhance product competitiveness 
we may not be able to purchase enough higher yielding assets necessary to fund higher crediting rates and maintain our desired spread  which could result in lower profitability on our in force business 
in rising interest rate environments  especially when interest rates are rapidly rising  it may be difficult to position our products to offer attractive rates and benefits to customers while maintaining profitability  which may limit sales growth of interest sensitive products 
in order to maintain sales growth of interest sensitive products and retain in force customers  we may offer higher renewal crediting rates which would impact profitability 
in addition  periods of rising interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders  withdrawals and requests for policy loans on deferred annuity and boli products  as policyholders and contract holders seek investments with higher returns  referred to as disintermediation 
this may lead to net cash outflows and the resulting liquidity demands may require us to sell investment assets when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates  which may result in realized investment losses 
further  a portion of our investment portfolio consists of commercial mortgage loans and privately placed securities  which are relatively illiquid  thus increasing our liquidity risk in the event of disintermediation 
we may also be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and dsi related to surrendered contracts  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in yield curves shifts in the relationship between short and long term interest rates  or yield curve  can also impact our ability to sell our products  particularly fixed annuities 
when the yield curve is relatively flat or negatively sloped ie  high short term rates as compared to long term rates  customers can receive similar crediting rates on competing products  such as certificates of deposit  which have shorter required investment periods 
customers may be more likely to choose those competing products than our annuities  which tend to be longer term in nature 

table of contents our investment portfolio is subject to various interest rates  credit and liquidity risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets  reduce investment returns and or erode capital 
the performance of our investment portfolio depends in part upon the level of and changes in interest rates and credit spreads  the overall performance of the economy  the creditworthiness of the specific obligors included in our portfolio  equity prices  real estate values  liquidity and other factors  most of which are beyond our control 
these factors could materially affect our investment results in any period and or erode capital 
as of december   our total investments were billion  of which billion were fixed maturities 
our fixed maturities portfolio generated net investment income of  million and  million  and realized gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest rate and credit spread risk interest rates and credit spreads are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  general investor sentiment  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual net investment income or cash flows to differ from those originally anticipated for investments that carry prepayment and extension risk  such as mortgage backed and other securities with embedded call options 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayments generally increase 
mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage obligations and other bonds in our investment portfolio may be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates 
if unanticipated  such prepayments may require us to accelerate amortization on investments purchased at a premium  which could decrease our net investment income 
additionally  we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments 
such prepayments may also include prepayment fees and penalties recorded as income in the period of prepayment which could create income volatility 
we received prepayment related income of million and million in and  respectively 
there are various us government initiatives through the making home affordable program that may result in higher than expected prepayments on our rmbs portfolio 
for example  changes to harp home affordable refinance program that went into effect in late  have been effective in increasing refinancing for certain borrowers 
additionally  the extension of hamp home affordable modification program through may impact prepayments 
we continually monitor the underlying collateral in our rmbs to manage our prepayment exposure 
as of december   we held  million in residential mortgage backed securities  including gross unamortized premiums of million 
an increase in prepayments could significantly accelerate our premium amortization and result in asset reinvestment at lower interest rates 
we include an estimate of future principal prepayments in the calculation of effective yields for mortgage backed securities 
differences between the actual and estimated timing of the principal prepayments impact our investment income and may reduce our overall interest rate spread 
as prepayments increase in periods of declining interest rates  premium amortization accelerates because the expected life of the asset is shortened 
in periods of rising interest rates  prepayments generally slow  and discount amortization slows because the expected life of the asset is extended 
these changes in amortization may adversely affect our investment income 
in addition  net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease in step with interest rates and credit spreads 
in periods of low interest rates  such as we experienced in and during the last several years  we may be challenged to find attractive yields on new investments 
in and  we mitigated this risk by increasing our originations of commercial mortgage loans  which generally provide higher yields  but are less liquid than fixed maturities securities 
however  we may be unable to continue to find appropriate loan opportunities meeting our high quality standards 
the fair value of our fixed maturities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with changes in interest rates and credit spreads 
because all of our fixed maturities are classified as available for sale  changes in the fair value of these securities are reflected as a component of comprehensive income 
a rise in 
table of contents interest rates may cause the fair value of our fixed maturity securities to decline  particularly for our long duration investments supporting our income annuities reserves 
declines in fair value may decrease unrealized gains or result in unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  and decrease our stockholders equity 
further  us gaap does not require similar fair value accounting treatment for the insurance liabilities that the fixed maturities support 
therefore  changes in the fair value of our fixed maturities caused by interest rate fluctuations are not offset in whole or in part by similar adjustments to the fair value of our insurance liabilities on the balance sheet 
we mitigate the risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads by employing asset to liability matching strategies to help ensure that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due 
however  these strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate and credit spread volatility 
credit risk issuers of the fixed maturities we own may default on principal and interest payments 
defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income or cause realized investment losses 
further  fixed maturities are evaluated for impairment based on our assumptions about the creditworthiness of the issuer 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred million and million in impairments on fixed maturities  respectively 
a significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturities portfolio could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the determination of impairments is subject to management s judgment about the creditworthiness and continued cash flows of a security 
while we have controls and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that our impairment analysis is complete and based on accurate information  actual cash flows and defaults may vary significantly from our assumptions 
as of december   of our total fixed maturity portfolio at fair value was considered below investment grade 
below investment grade securities generally provide higher expected returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities 
further  an issuer s inability to refinance or pay off debt could cause certain of our investment grade maturities to present more significant credit risk than when we first invested 
private equity and highly leveraged buyouts could also cause certain of our investment grade fixed maturities to present more significant credit risk than when we first invested 
issuers of the fixed maturities that we own may experience performance deterioration or other factors that trigger rating agency downgrades 
although the issuers may not have defaulted on principal and interest payments with respect to these securities  we may be required by regulators and rating agencies to hold more capital in support of these investments 
we could experience higher cost of capital and potential constraints on our ability to grow our business and maintain our own ratings 
for further information on our fixed maturities portfolio and credit related impairments  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 
liquidity risk our investments in privately placed fixed maturities  mortgage loans  policy loans and limited partnership interests  which collectively represented approximately of total invested assets as of december   are relatively illiquid compared to publicly traded fixed maturities and equities 
in addition  periods of market disruption  such as those experienced during the financial crisis in and  could also reduce liquidity for securities generally considered to be readily marketable 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
this risk is mitigated by the liquidity structure of our underlying liabilities  of which are considered illiquid or somewhat illiquid 
for further information on the liquidity of our underlying liabilities  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to execute on our strategies to reduce our dependence on interest rate sensitive products 
in our executive leadership team introduced its grow diversify business strategy that focused on developing new products that are less sensitive to interest rates 
during we devoted significant effort and financial resources to build new products  distribution and service capabilities 
we experienced increased sales of our fixed indexed annuity and group life and disability income products  however  individual life and variable annuity sales fell short of expectations 
we may incur higher than expected costs or fail to generate expected levels of revenue associated with this strategy 
we aim to continue implementing our strategies while maintaining current positions of strength in our existing businesses  particularly our medical stop loss and deferred annuity businesses  as well as maintaining the strength of our balance sheet 
our success will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to achieve customer name recognition  accurately predict market trends  differentiate our product offerings from our competitors  provide excellent customer service  develop new products in a timely manner and achieve market acceptance  effectively implement new technology and operational platforms  deepen our existing distribution relationships and add new distribution partners and set appropriate prices for our products 
if we fail to accomplish one  all or a combination of the foregoing  our ability to profitably grow our business during this period of prolonged low interest rates could be materially and adversely affected 
we may engage in strategic acquisitions or other related transactions which present risks that could adversely affect our business 
we have and continue to seek profitable growth through acquisitions opportunities 
we believe that our disciplined approach to strategic acquisitions  particularly related to our benefits and individual life divisions  will allow us to realize economies of scale and certain operating efficiencies 
any acquisitions or investments will include risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses  including failing to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired business  failing to successfully integrate the acquired business into our operations  paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets  experiencing an unanticipated downgrade in our financial strength ratings  disrupting our ongoing businesses  distracting management focus from our ongoing businesses  acquiring unanticipated liabilities  failing to retain key personnel  incurring the expense of an impairment of assets due to the failure to realize expected benefits  damaging relationships with employees  customers or strategic partners  and diluting the share value of existing stockholders 
additionally  in connection with any acquisition that involves reinsurance  we will assume or otherwise become responsible for the obligations of policies and other liabilities of other insurers 
any regulatory  legal  financial  or other adverse development affecting these other insurers could also have an adverse effect on us 
the exploration of acquisition opportunities requires a significant investment of time from our senior leadership team  and may require significant legal  consulting  financial and accounting expenses for due diligence 
we may not complete acquisitions that we explore  or incur higher than expected costs to complete an acquisition 
for example  in  expenses related to such due diligence efforts resulted in a decrease to net income of approximately per common diluted share for opportunities that did not materialize 

table of contents we may be unable to increase or maintain sales through independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists 
we distribute our products through financial intermediaries  independent producers and dedicated sales specialists 
we compete with other financial institutions to attract and retain commercial relationships in each of these channels  and our success in competing for sales through these sales intermediaries depends upon factors such as the amount of sales commissions and fees we pay  the breadth of our product offerings  the design and positioning of our product offerings  the amounts of or adjustments we make in premium or interest crediting rates  the strength of our brand and consumer name recognition  as well as reputation  our perceived stability and our financial strength ratings  the marketing and services we provide to them and our customers  and the strength of the relationships we maintain with individuals at those firms 
through time our relationship with distributors may deteriorate due to any of the above factors  which could result in a drop in sales and or a loss of existing business due to higher surrender activity 
our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to existing and potential distribution partners to favor their products or to reduce sales of our products 
our contracts with our distribution partners generally allow either party to terminate the relationship upon short notice 
our distribution partners do not make minimum purchase commitments  and our contracts do not prohibit our partners from offering products that compete with ours 
accordingly  our distribution partners may choose not to offer our products exclusively or at all  or may choose to exert insufficient resources and attention to selling our products 
in sales from our top five distribution partners in our deferred annuities and benefits segments represented and  respectively  of each segment s total sales 
in addition  sales from one financial institution accounted for of our deferred annuities segment sales 
if our relationships with these distributors were to deteriorate  it is likely that we would experience a significant decline in our sales 
for further discussion on our sales and distribution  see item business distribution 
turbulent economic conditions may also impair our distribution partners  which would have an adverse impact on our sales 
further  consolidation of financial institutions could increase competition for access to distributors  result in greater distribution expenses  and impair our ability to market our products to our current customer base or to expand our customer base 
from time to time  due to competitive forces  we may also experience unusually high employee attrition in particular sales channels for specific products 
an inability to recruit productive independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists  or our inability to retain strong relationships with the individual agents at our independent sales intermediaries  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our future success is highly dependent on maintaining and growing both existing and new distribution relationships 
we may have little or no contact or brand awareness with end customers of our products  which makes it more difficult to respond to evolving customer needs and increases our reliance on our distribution partners 

table of contents defaults in our commercial mortgage loans may adversely affect our profitability 
our mortgage loans  which are collateralized by commercial properties  are subject to default risk 
the company seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices 
our underwriting practice includes the analysis of a borrower s prior credit history  financial statements  tax returns and cash flow projections  valuation of collateral  personal guarantees of loans  and verification of liquid assets 
during  we began strategically increasing our mortgage loan portfolio  which continued through for the years ended december  and  we originated million and million  respectively  of new loans 
our mortgage loan portfolio totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
we carry our mortgage loans at outstanding principal balances  adjusted for unamortized deferred fees and costs  net of an allowance for loan losses 
our allowance includes a reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses in the portfolio  and specific reserves for any non performing loans 
the reserve for probable incurred losses is based on our historical experience  third party data for expected losses on loans with similar loan to value  and debt service coverage ratios 
specific reserves are determined by comparing the carrying value of the loan to the expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the underlying collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
if our underwriting practices fail to capture accurate information or proves to be inadequate  we may incur losses  and those losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves 
as of december   one loan with an outstanding principal balance of was classified as non performing 
however  due to the uncertain economic environment and the growth in our portfolio  the performance of our mortgage loan portfolio may decline in the future 
in addition  the majority of our loans have balloon payment maturities  which may trigger future defaults on currently performing loans 
an increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments  caused by current or worsening economic conditions or otherwise  could result in realized losses or increases in our allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  any geographic concentration of our commercial mortgage loans may expose us to higher risk of adverse effects 
while we seek to mitigate this risk by having a diversified portfolio  events or developments negatively impacting any particular geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our loan portfolio and  consequently  on our results of operations or financial condition 
as of december   of our commercial mortgage loans were located in california  primarily in the los angeles area  were located in texas and were located in washington 
for additional information on our mortgage loan portfolio  see note to the consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments mortgage loans 
gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may become realized or result in future impairments  resulting in a reduction in our net income 
fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at their estimated fair value and compose a significant portion of our total assets 
liquidity needs  portfolio rebalancing  or other reasons may require us to sell these securities prior to maturity  or credit concerns could prompt us to conclude that a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
the resulting realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income 
unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities are recognized as a component of aoci and are therefore excluded from net income 
the accumulated change in the fair value of these available for sale securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other than temporary and an impairment charge is taken 
our gross unrealized losses on available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities as of december  were million 
gross unrealized losses for fixed maturity and equity securities where the fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost or cost by or more for six months or more was million as of december  
table of contents our valuation of fixed maturity securities may include methodologies  estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
fixed maturities are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and represent approximately of our invested assets as of december  the accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three level hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation models using unobservable inputs level 
level and level measurements comprise a significant portion of our invested assets  as of december   approximately billion  or  of our fixed maturities were categorized as level measurements  and billion  or  were categorized as level because values for securities classified as level and level are not based on quoted market prices for identical instruments  the amount we realize upon settlement or maturity may differ significantly from our reported fair value 
additionally  multiple valuation methods may be applicable to a security  and the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value amounts 
decreases in valuations may result in unrealized losses recorded in stockholders equity or realized losses recorded in net income  which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our level measurements are predominantly obtained from third party independent pricing services and derived from models that use objectively verifiable  observable market inputs  such as benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers and other reference data  including market research publications 
because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis  evaluated pricing models apply available information through processes such as benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing 
if such information about a security is unavailable  we determine the fair value using internal pricing models that typically utilize significant  unobservable market inputs or inputs that are difficult to corroborate with observable market data 
as of december   million  or  of our fixed maturities portfolio was invested in private placement securities  which are not actively traded 
the fair values of million  or  of these assets are classified as level  as they are determined using a discounted cash flow approach that uses significant inputs that are market observable 
during periods of market disruption  including periods of significantly rising interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain securities if trading becomes less frequent and or market data becomes less observable 
there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment 
in such cases  valuations for those securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment  including valuation methods  inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation 
rapidly changing and adverse credit and equity market conditions could also materially impact the valuation of securities reported in our consolidated financial statements  and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
to mitigate these risks  we use established  industry standard valuation models consistently from period to period 
for more information on our valuation methodology for invested assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates assets at fair value 
additionally  our investment management objective is to support the expected cash flows of our liabilities and to produce stable returns over the long term  thus  we typically hold our fixed maturities until maturity or until market conditions are favorable for the sale of such investments 

table of contents downturns and volatility in equity markets could adversely affect our profitability 
we recognize changes in fair value of our investments in certain common stock  including reits or other equity like securities  in net income through net realized investment gains losses 
these investments  which generally provide higher expected total returns over the long term  present a greater risk to preservation of principal than our fixed maturity investments 
as of december   less than three percent of our invested assets were invested in securities whose changes in fair value are typically highly correlated with changes in the equity markets 
while these investments do not represent a significant portion of our invested assets  a decline in the equity markets could have a significant adverse effect on our net income  and also increase volatility in results between periods 
for example  for the year ended december   net gains on our equity securities trading portfolio were million  consistent with improvements in the equity markets that year 
in the previous year  ending december   net losses on our equity securities trading portfolio were million  as equity market performance was not as strong 
in another example  we invest in real estate related investments through investments in reits 
for the year ended december   our reits provided a total gross return of 
however  during  we experienced volatility in our quarterly results including total gross gains of for the first quarter  and for the third quarter 
our use of derivative financial instruments to manage risk may not be effective or sufficient 
we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate various business and investment risks to which we are exposed  including exposures related to our fia product  foreign currency exposures  adverse effects of equity market levels and volatility and interest rate fluctuations on variable rate fixed maturities 
if our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments  our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective 
this failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivatives and related accounting policies 
we may also choose not to hedge  in whole or in part  these or other risks that we have identified  due to  for example  the availability and or cost of a suitable derivative financial instrument or  in reaction to extreme interest rate or equity market conditions  a decision to not purchase a derivative financial instrument that fully hedges certain risks 
additionally  our estimates and assumptions made in connection with our use of any derivative financial instrument may fail to reflect or correspond to our actual long term exposure in respect to identified risks 
derivative financial instruments held or purchased may also be insufficient to hedge the risks in relation to our obligations 
in addition  we may fail to identify risks  or the magnitude thereof  to which we are exposed 
the dodd frank act includes a new framework of regulation of over the counter otc derivative transactions that requires parties to such transactions to enter into agreements that provide for  among other things  each party s right to accelerate  terminate  and close out positions on a net basis and liquidate or set off collateral upon an event of default  including bankruptcy or insolvency  of the other party 
such agreements  including the netting requirement  must be enforceable under the law of the relevant jurisdiction 
two of our life insurance subsidiaries  including our principal life insurance subsidiary  are domiciled in the state of washington  where current law would permit a receiver for an insolvent insurance company to avoid the netting requirement in otc derivative agreements entered into by the insolvent insurer 
there is legislation pending in the washington legislature that would implement model naic legislation that mandates enforcement of such netting provisions in the event of insurer insolvency 
if the legislation is not enacted  our washington life insurance subsidiaries will face challenges in entering into derivatives transactions with major financial institutions 
in such an event  we will explore other options  including redomesticating one or both of our washington life insurance companies to a jurisdiction that has enacted this legislation 
under the agreements required by the dodd frank act  we may be unable to place derivative trades at a reasonable cost  or at all 
if we are unable to engage in derivative transactions at a reasonable cost  we may not be able to continue to issue certain insurance products  including fixed indexed annuities  or otherwise effectively manage other risks  such as interest rate or currency risk 

table of contents in addition  the dodd frank act imposes additional costs  including new capital  reporting and margin requirements and additional regulation 
increased margin requirements on our part  combined with restrictions on securities that will qualify as eligible collateral  could reduce liquidity and require an increase in our holdings of cash and government securities with lower yields  causing a reduction in income 
the derivative clearing requirements of dodd frank will generally increase the cost of our risk mitigation and could potentially expose us to the risk of a default by a clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transactions 
the above factors  either alone or in combination  may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may face unanticipated losses if we determine our reserves for future policy benefits and claims are inadequate  or there are significant deviations from our pricing assumptions 
we calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future benefit payments to our policyholders and contract holders in accordance with us gaap  which are released as those future obligations are extinguished 
the reserves we establish are estimates  primarily based on actuarial assumptions with regard to our future experience  which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
our future financial results depend upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions we have used in pricing our products and determining our reserves 
many factors can affect future experience  including economic  political and social conditions  mortality and morbidity  persistency  inflation  healthcare costs and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation 
therefore  we cannot predict the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual future benefits or the timing of those payments 
health care costs in particular have risen substantially in recent history and may continue to do so 
our medical stop loss products provide coverage for claims exceeding certain dollar thresholds for either individual or aggregate claims  and increased medical costs may result in higher claims 
our policies are typically one year contracts and are underwritten and repriced annually 
while we monitor claims costs and changes that may affect future costs  such as medical inflation  changing demographics and changes in the mix of our business  increases in medical costs may exceed our expectations or may not be properly factored into our pricing 
this could adversely affect the results of operations in our benefits segment 
persistency is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next 
for most of our products  actual persistency that is lower than our assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability  especially in the early years of a policy or contract primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract 
in addition  we may need to sell investments at a loss to fund withdrawals 
for some of our life insurance policies  actual persistency in later policy durations that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability 
if these policies remain in force longer than we assumed  then we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced these products 
in addition  we set prices for our insurance and certain annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns  using assumptions for  among other factors  morbidity rates and mortality rates of our policyholders and contract holders 
the long term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions 
for example  if morbidity rates are higher or mortality rates are lower than our pricing assumptions  we could be required to make greater payments under our insurance and certain annuity contracts than we had projected 
our largest exposure to morbidity risk is in our medical stop loss products  which we mitigate through reinsurance 
for example  our specific stop loss business is reinsured for claims above million 
our largest exposure to mortality risk is in our individual life segment  which we also mitigate through reinsurance 
additionally  a general increase in mortality would be favorable to our income annuities segment  as we may pay fewer benefits than expected 
also in our income annuities segment  we can experience mortality losses on life contingent policies when mortality rates are lower than expected 

table of contents we regularly monitor our reserves and review our assumptions 
if we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claims payments  we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges in the period in which we make that determination  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there were no significant adjustments to reserves due to inadequacy during  or although certain of our products permit us to increase premiums or reduce benefits or crediting rates during the life of the policy or contract  these changes may not be sufficient to maintain profitability  or may reduce the attractiveness of our products relative to competitors 
moreover  many of our products either do not permit us to increase premiums or reduce benefits or may limit those changes during the life of the policy or contract 
therefore  significant deviations in experience from our assumptions regarding persistency  mortality and morbidity rates could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
the amount of statutory capital that we have and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to meet rating agency  regulatory and other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control  including equity market and credit market conditions and changes in rating agency models 
we conduct the vast majority of our business through our insurance company subsidiaries 
accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
the naic has established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital rbc formulas for our insurance company subsidiaries 
the rbc formula for our insurance company subsidiaries establishes minimum capital requirements relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
in any particular year  statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions  the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth or to support changes in the mix of business  changes in equity market levels  the value of certain fixed income and equity securities in our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates  changes in credit quality ratings for the bonds in our investment portfolio  and changes to the rbc formulas 
most of these factors are outside of our control 
our financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries 
in addition  rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital they believe we should hold 
further  in scenarios of extended periods of very low interest rates  such as those experienced recently  the amount of statutory reserves that we are required to hold may increase  which reduces our statutory surplus 
annually we are required to assess statutory reserve adequacy and as of december   a million statutory reserve was established  which reduced our statutory surplus by approximately million  net of tax 
for further information on this statutory reserve  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our statutory financial statements are subject to the statements of statutory accounting principles ssaps  which is promulgated by the naic 
in addition  the naic  through its life and health actuarial task force  issues interpretations or guidelines actuarial guidelines of state statutes related to reserves and other actuarial topics 
these guidelines are used to apply a statute to a particular circumstance 
these ssaps and actuarial guidelines impact our statutory surplus and therefore impact the amount of capital we are required to maintain 
for example  the valuation of life insurance policies regulation  as clarified by actuarial guideline more commonly known as regulation xxx and axxx requires insurers to establish additional or redundant statutory reserves for certain universal life and term insurance policies with secondary guarantees 
we expect to implement a strategy to manage reserve redundancies in the future as we expect sales of these types of products to increase 
however  we cannot provide assurance that there will not be regulatory  tax or other 
table of contents challenges to the actions we have taken or will take in the future 
the result of this or other potential changes or related challenges could require us to increase statutory reserves or incur higher operating and or tax costs 
we may face unanticipated losses if we are required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and or deferred sales inducements if there are significant deviations in actual experience or in anticipated assumptions 
deferred policy acquisition costs represent certain costs that vary with and are directly related to the successful acquisition and renewal of our products and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related contracts 
these costs include commissions for successful contract acquisitions  premium based taxes and assessments  distribution costs directly related to successful contract acquisition  third party underwriting costs related to contracts that are successfully acquired  and the portion of the salaries and benefits related to employee time spent on the processing of successfully acquired new and renewal contracts 
all other acquisition related costs  including costs incurred for soliciting potential customers  managing distribution and underwriting functions  training  administration  unsuccessful acquisition or renewal efforts  market research and product development are not deferrable 
deferred sales inducements represent bonus interest and excess interest mainly on our fixed annuity products  which are deferred and reported in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized as interest credited over the estimated life of the related contracts 
under us gaap  dac and dsi are amortized through income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits for most of our products 
as of december   we had million of dac and million of dsi  excluding the adjustment for unrealized gains on investments 
our amortization of dac and dsi generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments  crediting rates  surrender and other policy and contract charges  mortality  morbidity and maintenance and expense margins 
unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses  investment returns  crediting rates  mortality  morbidity  withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of dac and dsi  resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability 
our assumptions  including those related to expenses  investment returns  credited interest rates  mortality  morbidity  withdrawals or lapse experience among others  are adjusted quarterly to reflect actual experience to date 
for future assumptions  we conduct a study to refine our estimates of future gross profits on an annual basis during the third quarter 
upon completion of this study  we revise our assumptions and update our dac models to reflect our current best estimate 
changes in our actual experience or our expected future experience may result in increased amortization of dac or dsi  which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability 
we regularly review our dac and dsi asset balances to determine if it is recoverable from future income 
the portion of the dac and dsi asset balances deemed to be unrecoverable  if any  is charged to expense in the period in which we make this determination 
for example  if we determine that we are unable to recover dac or dsi from profits over the life of a book of business of insurance policies or annuity contracts  we would be required to recognize the unrecoverable dac or dsi amortization as a current period expense

table of contents changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap  which is periodically revised by recognized authorities  including the financial accounting standards board fasb 
on january   we adopted a revised standard for dac  which limited the costs that are eligible for deferral 
this standard resulted in more acquisition costs being expensed as incurred  which was partially offset by a decrease in related amortization expense 
for further discussion on the impacts of adoption of new accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the fasb is developing new accounting standards in an effort to converge us gaap accounting with international accounting principles 
as a part of this effort  new standards are being developed for accounting for insurance contracts  which would measure liabilities for insurance contracts based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to fulfill the contract 
this could change the recognition and measurement of insurance obligations on our statement of financial position and impact the timing of the related income in our results of operations 
the fasb is also drafting a new standard for financial instruments which  as currently proposed  would change the way assets and liabilities classified as financial instruments are recognized and measured 
in december  the fasb proposed a new standard that changed the way credit losses for financial assets are measured 
other standards are also being proposed as a part of this convergence project that would also impact our consolidated statements 
if adopted  these accounting standards could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements  and such changes could have an adverse effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business 
financial strength ratings  which various ratings organizations publish as measures of an insurance company s ability to meet contract holder and policyholder obligations  are important to maintaining public confidence in our company and our products  and the ability to market our products and our competitive position 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings  or the announced potential for a downgrade  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in several ways  including reducing new sales of insurance products  annuities and other investment products  increasing our cost of capital  adversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists  materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contract holders and policyholders  requiring us to reduce prices or increase crediting rates for many of our products and services to remain competitive  and adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance 
we rely on reinsurance arrangements to help manage our business risks  and failure to perform by the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements may expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate 
we utilize reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances  primarily related to products offered by our benefits and individual life divisions 
reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders  even when the reinsurer is liable to us 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
the total reinsurance recoverables due from reinsurers was million as of december   of which million was recoverable from our single largest reinsurer 
our reinsurers may be unable or unwilling to pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us now or in the future or on a timely basis 
a reinsurer s insolvency  inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents reinsurance may not be available  affordable or adequate to protect us against losses 
as part of our overall risk management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments 
while reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing  market conditions beyond our control can determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business 
in certain circumstances  the price of reinsurance for business already reinsured may also increase 
any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will reduce our earnings 
accordingly  we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance  may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms or may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage  which could adversely affect our ability to write future business  offer new products or enter new markets  or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to those policies we issue 
for further discussion on our reinsurance program  see item business reinsurance 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 
our businesses are subject to intense competition 
we believe the competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features  price  commission structure  marketing and distribution arrangements  brand  reputation  financial strength ratings and service 
many other companies actively compete for sales of deferred and income annuity products  group health and life insurance  including other major insurers  banks  other financial institutions  mutual fund and asset management firms and specialty providers 
in many of our product lines  we face competition from companies that have greater market share or breadth of distribution  stronger brand awareness  offer a broader range of products  services or features  assume a greater level of risk  have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do 
many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels 
the substantial expansion of banks and insurance companies distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years have intensified pressure on margins and production levels and have increased the level of competition in many of our product lines  which could make it difficult to achieve our target returns 
our strategies for mitigating risks arising from our day to day operations may prove ineffective resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 
our performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks that arise from a large number of our day to day business activities  including setting of premium or interest crediting rates  underwriting  claims processing  policy administration and servicing  execution of our investment strategy  financial and tax reporting  marketing and sales efforts  and other activities  many of which are complex 
we also may rely on third parties for such activities 
we seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of or related to these activities through a variety of internal controls  management review processes  and other mechanisms 
however  the occurrence of unforeseen or un contemplated risks  or the occurrence of risks of a greater magnitude than expected  including those arising from a failure in processes  procedures or systems implemented by us or a failure on the part of employees or third parties upon which we rely in this regard  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the occurrence of natural disasters  disease pandemics  terrorism or military actions could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our financial condition and results of operations are at risk of material adverse effects that could arise from catastrophic mortality and morbidity due to natural disasters  including floods  tornadoes  earthquakes and hurricanes  disease pandemics  terrorism and military actions 
such events could also lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and contract holders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations  such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies or deposits into our investment products 
the effectiveness of external parties  including governmental and nongovernmental organizations  in combating the spread and severity of a disease pandemic could have a material impact on the losses experienced by us 

table of contents the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets  and a natural disaster or a disease pandemic could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster 
these could adversely impact the valuation and performance of our investment portfolio 
further  for products sold through our benefits and individual life divisions  a localized event that affects one or more of our customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims 
the majority of our operations are located in bellevue  washington  although we have other offices throughout the us we maintain a business continuity plan for our operations  but we cannot predict with certainty whether our plan will be successfully implemented in the event of an actual catastrophic event or disaster or predict with certainty when normal business operations would resume if such an event occurs 
in the event of a catastrophic event or disaster  our employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time  and or we may have limited or no connectivity  which may interrupt our business operations and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the majority of our employees are equipped to work remotely  however certain duties  such as processing new business applications  may be difficult to perform remotely 
the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could adversely affect our business 
we use computer systems to store  retrieve  evaluate and use customer and company data and information 
additionally  our computer and information technology systems interface with and rely upon third party systems 
our business is highly dependent on our ability  and the ability of our business partners  to access these systems to perform necessary business functions  including providing insurance quotes  processing premium payments  providing customer support  filing and paying claims and making changes to existing policies 
we also use systems for investment management  financial reporting and data analysis to support our policyholder reserves and other actuarial estimates 
our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not maintain adequate systems  we could experience adverse consequences  including inadequate information on which to base pricing  underwriting and reserving decisions  inadequate information for accurate financial reporting  increases in administrative expenses  the loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  customer  provider and agent disputes  litigation exposure  or regulatory compliance problems  such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations 
systems outages or outright failures would compromise our ability to perform critical functions in a timely manner 
this could hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and harm our ability to conduct business 
in the event of a disaster such as a blackout  a computer virus  a cyber attack  an industrial accident  a natural catastrophe  a terrorist attack or war  our systems may not be available to our employees  customers or business partners for an extended period of time 
if our systems or our data are destroyed or disabled  employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time 
our systems could also be subject to similar disruptions due to physical and electronic break ins or other types of unauthorized tampering with our systems 
this may interrupt our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we have committed and will continue to commit resources to develop  maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences 
our ability to keep our systems fully integrated with those of our clients is critical to the operation of our business  and failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients 
the failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business 
a number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations 
for example  the collection and use of patient data in our benefits segment is the subject of national and state legislation  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and certain of the activities conducted by our businesses are subject to the privacy regulations of the gramm leach bliley act and state privacy laws and regulations 
we also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and clients 
these obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information 
the actions we take to protect confidential information vary by business segment and may include  among other things training and educating our employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential information  monitoring changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements  drafting appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues  maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records  limiting access to electronic information  and in the event of a security breach  providing credit monitoring or other services to affected customers 
in addition  we must develop  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information 
if we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information  we could experience adverse consequences  including regulatory sanctions  such as penalties  fines and loss of license  as well as loss of reputation and possible litigation 
this could have an adverse impact on our company s image and  therefore  result in lower sales or lapses of existing business 
our business could be interrupted or compromised if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships 
we outsource significant technology and business functions to third parties  including a substantial portion of our investment management and information technology functions  and expect to continue to do so in the future 
when we engage a third party vendor  we perform due diligence on the vendor  including evaluations of quality of service  financial stability  compliance with laws and regulations and appropriate business continuity plans 
however  if our due diligence is not sufficient  we do not maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or third party providers do not perform as contracted  we may experience operational difficulties  increased costs and a loss of business and reputation that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
further our third party service providers are required to maintain and routinely test business continuity plans 
however  catastrophic events interrupting their business operations may disrupt their provision of critical services to us for an extended period of time  which may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 

table of contents our credit facility subjects us to operating and financial covenants on our operations and could limit our ability to grow our business 
we have a million revolving credit facility 
this credit facility also provides access to up to an additional million of financing  subject to the availability of additional commitments 
we rely on the facility as a potential source of liquidity  which could be critical in enabling us to meet our obligations as they come due  particularly during periods when alternative sources of liquidity are limited 
as of december   we had no balance outstanding and we have had no borrowings under this facility or under the previous facility since originally established 
in connection with the current facility  we have agreed to covenants that may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness by our subsidiaries  limit the ability of us and our subsidiaries to create liens and impose certain other operating limitations 
these restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing or take advantage of business opportunities 
furthermore  our credit facility requires us and our insurance subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
if we are unable to comply with the covenants and ratios in our credit facility  we may be deemed in default under the facility and unable to access it when needed  or we may be required to pay substantial fees or penalties to the lenders to obtain a waiver of any such default 
either development could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
raising additional capital could dilute stockholder ownership in the company and may cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
we need liquidity to pay our policyholder benefits  operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends on our outstanding common stock and warrants  and to pay down or replace certain debt obligations as they mature 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund liquidity needs  refinance our senior notes or our capital efficient notes cents  satisfy letter of credit or guarantee bond requirements that may be imposed by our clients or by regulators  acquire new businesses or invest in existing businesses  grow our business  otherwise respond to competitive pressures  maintain adequate risk based capital  or maintain our target ratings from rating agencies 
future deterioration of our capital position at a time when we are unable to access the long term debt market could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  which may require us to reduce or eliminate future stockholder dividends of our common stock  utilize unused borrowings for general corporate purposes  undertake additional capital management activities  including reinsurance transactions  limit or curtail sales of certain products and or restructure existing products  undertake asset sales or internal asset transfers  and seek temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules 

table of contents certain of these actions may require regulatory approval and or the approval of counterparties  which are outside of our control or have economic costs associated with them 
actions we might take to access financing may also cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings 
further  in connection with the cents offering  we entered into a covenant that may limit our ability to undertake certain additional types of financing to repay or redeem the cents 
any additional capital raised through the sale of equity will dilute each stockholder s ownership percentage in our company and may decrease the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  newly issued securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our common stock 
any additional financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us 
without sufficient liquidity  we could be forced to curtail our operations  and our business could suffer 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets may limit our access to capital required to operate our business and maintain desired financial ratios 
these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to grow our business  replace capital withdrawn by customers or raise new capital required by our subsidiaries as a result of volatility in the markets in a timely manner 
as a result  we may be forced to delay raising capital  bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price  which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility 
as a holding company  symetra financial corporation depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its obligations and pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases 
symetra is a holding company for its insurance and financial subsidiaries with no significant operations of its own 
its principal sources of cash to meet its obligations and to pay dividends consist of dividends from its subsidiaries and permitted payments under tax sharing agreements with its subsidiaries 
in addition  the ability to execute common stock repurchases may be dependent on dividends from symetra s subsidiaries 
on february   symetra s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of outstanding common stock 
the timing and amount of any stock repurchases will be determined by management  based on market conditions  regulatory considerations and other factors 
the ability to execute repurchases under this program may be dependent on dividends from symetra s subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
based on our statutory results as of december   insurance subsidiaries may pay symetra dividends of up to million in the aggregate during without obtaining regulatory approval 
competitive pressures generally require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings  which are partly based on maintaining certain levels of capital 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements  such as minimum required risk based capital ratios  affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase common stock and service our debt 
dividends paid to the common stockholders and warrant holders are at the discretion of the board of directors 
more information about the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
significant stockholders may be able to influence the direction of our business 
our principal stockholders  affiliates of white mountains insurance group  ltd 
and berkshire hathaway inc  each beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of february  including warrants exercisable for  shares held by affiliates of each of white mountains insurance group  ltd 
and berkshire hathaway inc 
accordingly  they may have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the nomination and election of directors and the determination of the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for 
table of contents approval  including amendments to our certificate of incorporation  potential mergers or acquisitions  asset sales and other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of our principal stockholders may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock 
risks related to our industry our industry is highly regulated and changes in regulations affecting our businesses may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 
our insurance businesses are heavily regulated and are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state insurance laws and regulated by the insurance departments of the various states in which they are domiciled and licensed 
state laws in the united states grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to various aspects of our insurance businesses  including licensing companies and agents to transact business  calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements  mandating certain insurance benefits  regulating certain premium rates  reviewing and approving policy forms  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  including the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices  distribution arrangements and payment of inducements  establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards  establishing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts  requiring regular market conduct examinations  conducting unannounced and targeted market conduct examinations  approving changes in control of insurance companies  restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates  and regulating the types  amounts and valuation of investments 
state insurance regulators and the naic regularly re examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products 
changes in these laws and regulations  or in interpretations thereof  are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have an adverse effect on our business 
currently  the us federal government does not regulate directly the business of insurance 
however  the dodd frank act created a federal insurance office 
while the office will not directly regulate domestic insurance business  it is tasked with studying the potential efficiency and consequences of federal insurance regulation 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  the results of these studies or other such proposals  if enacted  may have on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  federal legislation and administrative policies in other areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies  including general financial services regulation  securities regulation  pension regulation  privacy regulation  tort reform legislation  and taxation 
during  the united states supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the patient protection and affordable care act  which impacts our medical stop loss and limited benefit medical businesses 
however  as there are still implementation details yet to be clarified at the state and federal levels  it remains unclear at this 
table of contents time how our medical stop loss business would be impacted 
further  our limited benefit medical product will need to be repositioned as supplemental coverage and we cannot predict whether such repositioning will be successful 
we will continue to monitor the implementation of ppaca and reassess our business strategies accordingly 
many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate in regulated environments 
changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or to distribute our products 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel intensive  and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance efforts and other expenses of doing business 
for example  in  the naic adopted the risk management and own risk and solvency assessment orsa model act  which requires insurers to maintain a framework for identifying  assessing  monitoring  managing and reporting on the material and relevant risks associated with the insurer s current business plans 
orsa  which provides for an effective date of january   is part of the naic s overall solvency modernization initiative smi 
as a model act  orsa must be adopted by our domiciliary state to be effective for our insurance companies 
we are working to integrate the requirements of orsa into our existing risk management framework 
us federal and state securities laws apply to investment products that are also securities  including variable annuities and variable life insurance policies 
as a result  some of our subsidiaries and the policies and contracts they offer are subject to regulation under these federal and state securities laws 
some of our insurance subsidiaries separate accounts are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of some subsidiaries are registered as broker dealers under the securities exchange act of and are members of  and subject to regulation by finra 
in addition  two of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the investment advisers act of these subsidiaries may also be impacted by interpretations and rules created as a result of the dodd frank act 
securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to ensure the integrity of financial markets and to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory or brokerage clients 
these laws and regulations grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with those laws and regulations 
legal and regulatory investigations and actions are increasingly common in our businesses and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation 
we face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses  including the risk of class action lawsuits 
our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate 
we may become subject to class actions and regulatory actions and we are or may become subject to individual lawsuits relating  among other things  to sales or underwriting practices  payment of contingent or other sales commissions  claims payments and procedures  product design  disclosure  administration  additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis  interest crediting practices  denial or delay of benefits  breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers  and investment activities 
plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
such litigation or regulatory investigations may relate to the following annuity sales to seniors continue to be scrutinized by finra and state insurance regulators  and have been the source of industry litigation in situations where annuity sales have allegedly been unsuitable for the seniors financial needs 
funding services have been viewed unfavorably in the past by consumer advocates and the media and have the potential to be misunderstood by regulators and courts 
this is particularly the case where we offer funding services to payees of our own structured settlement annuities 

table of contents we are subject to market conduct examinations related to unclaimed property by state insurance regulators and audits of escheatment practices by state revenue authorities  related to the following state insurance regulators have been scrutinizing claims settlement practices of life insurance companies with regard to payment of death benefits 
through their authority to regulate market conduct  including claims settlement practices  state insurance regulators have been examining the use by life insurance companies of the us social security administration s death master file ssadmf to identify deceased persons and the processes by which life insurance companies search for beneficiaries of life and annuity contracts 
in particular  these regulators have been looking at how life insurance companies handle unreported deaths  maturity of life insurance and annuity contracts  and contracts that have exceeded limiting age to determine if the companies are appropriately identifying when death benefits or other payments under the contracts should be made 
several states have enacted new laws or adopted new regulations mandating the use by life insurance companies of the ssadmf or other similar data bases to identify deceased persons and more rigorous processes to find beneficiaries 
symetra s life insurance companies are currently being examined by the california department of insurance on behalf of itself and several other states with regard to the companies claims settlement practices 
state insurance regulators also have been scrutinizing claims settlement practices of life insurance companies with regard to unclaimed life insurance and annuity death benefits  including escheatment practices 
through their authority to regulate market conduct  including unclaimed property practices  state insurance regulators have been examining the escheatment practices of life insurance companies and sanctioned several for failure to escheat death benefits or other contract benefits to state revenue authorities when beneficiaries could not be found at the expiration of statutory dormancy periods 
sanctions have included fines and agreements by insurance companies to improve their escheatment practices 
symetra s life insurance companies are currently being examined by the california insurance department on behalf of itself and several other states with regard to their unclaimed property and escheatment practices 
state treasurers  controllers and revenue departments have also been scrutinizing escheatment practices of life insurance companies with regard to unclaimed life insurance and annuity death benefits 
as with state insurance regulators  state revenue authorities have been looking at how life insurance companies handle unreported deaths  maturity of life insurance and annuity contracts  and contracts that have exceeded limiting age to determine if the companies are appropriately determining when death benefits or other payments under the contracts should be treated as unclaimed property 
state treasurers  controllers and revenue departments have audited life insurance companies  required escheatments and imposed interest penalties on amounts escheated for failure to escheat death benefits or other contract benefits when beneficiaries could not be found at the expiration of statutory dormancy periods 
symetra s life insurance companies are currently being audited by a private contractor working for a number of state revenue departments to determine whether unclaimed life insurance and annuity death benefits should be escheated to the states in which deceased owners resided 
it is possible that examinations  audits and related activity and or new state laws or regulations could result in additional payments to beneficiaries  additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws  interest penalties  and changes to the symetra life insurance companies procedures 
given the legal and regulatory uncertainty in this area  it is also possible that life insurers  including symetra s life insurers  may be subject to claims  regulatory actions  law enforcement actions and civil litigation concerning their business practices 
any resulting additional payments or costs would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are also subject to various other regulatory inquiries  such as information requests  subpoenas  market conduct exams and books and record examinations  from state and federal regulators and other authorities  which may result in fines  recommendations for corrective action or other regulatory actions 

table of contents current or future investigations and proceedings could have an adverse effect on our business 
a substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business 
moreover  even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation  regulatory action or investigation  we could suffer significant reputational harm  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal actions or precedents and industry wide regulations or practices that could adversely affect our business 
potential changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to customers and adversely affect our results of operations 
many of the products that we sell benefit from one or more forms of tax favored status under current federal tax law 
for example  we sell life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy  as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries 
we also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract 
in addition  we benefit from current tax laws  changes in which could increase our company tax liability and income tax expense 
for example  recent federal budget proposals  if enacted  would affect the taxation of life insurance companies and certain life insurance products 
in particular  those proposals include modifying the dividends received deduction for life insurance company separate accounts and expanding the interest expense disallowance for corporate owned life insurance 
if proposals of this type were enacted  our sales could be adversely affected  primarily variable products and boli  and our actual tax expense could increase  reducing earnings 
congress has previously considered and may revisit legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers  including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefits derived from the tax deferred nature of life insurance and annuity products 
due in large part to the ongoing budget crisis affecting many governments  there is an increasing risk that federal and or state tax legislation could be enacted that would result in higher taxes on insurance companies and their policyholders 
although the specific form of any such potential legislation is uncertain  it could include reducing or eliminating some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us or our policyholders 
changes to these favorable tax statuses could adversely affect our sales and lapses of current policies 
failures elsewhere in the insurance industry could obligate us to pay assessments through guaranty associations 
when an insurance company becomes insolvent  state insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess other insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to pay obligations to policyholders of the insolvent company  up to the state specific limit of coverage 
the total amount of the assessment is typically based on the number of insured residents in each state  and each company s portion is based on its proportionate share of premium volume in the relevant lines of business 
the future failure of a large life  health or annuity insurer could trigger assessments which we would be obligated to pay 
further  amounts for historical insolvencies may be assessed over many years  and there can be significant uncertainty around the total obligation for a given insolvency 
in addition  certain states allow us to offset future assessments with premium tax offsets which are estimated and recorded as a corresponding asset 
existing liabilities may not be sufficient to fund the ultimate obligations of a historical insolvency  and we may be required to increase our liability  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  future premium tax offsets may not be realized and we may be required to decrease our asset  which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations
