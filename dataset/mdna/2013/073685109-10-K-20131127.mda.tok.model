overview we are one of the largest distributors of residential and non residential roofing materials in the united states and canada 
we are also a distributor of other building materials  including siding  windows  specialty lumber products and waterproofing systems for residential and nonresidential building exteriors 
we purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a customer base consisting of contractors and  to a lesser extent  general contractors  retailers and building material suppliers 
depending on the market  each of our branches carries from about  to  skus  totaling to more than  skus throughout our network of branches across the united states and canada 
in fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were in the united states 
we stock one of the most extensive assortments of high quality branded products in the industry  enabling us to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
execution of the operating plan at each of our branches drives our financial results 
revenues are impacted by the relative strength of the residential and non residential roofing markets we serve 
we strive for an appropriate mix of residential  non residential and complementary product sales in all of our regions but allow each of our branches to influence its own marketing plan and mix of products based upon its local market 
we differentiate ourselves from the competition by providing many customer services such as job site delivery  tapered insulation layouts and design and metal fabrication  and by providing credit 
we consider customer relations and our employees knowledge of roofing and exterior building materials to be important to our ability to increase customer loyalty and maintain customer satisfaction 
we invest significant resources in training our employees in sales techniques  management skills and product knowledge 
while we consider these attributes important drivers of our business  we also continually pay close attention to controlling operating costs 
our growth strategy includes both internal growth opening branches  growing sales with existing customers  adding new customers and introducing new products and acquisition growth 
our main acquisition strategy is to target market leaders in geographic areas that we do not service or that complement our existing operations in an area 
the following transactions highlight our recent success delivering on our growth strategy we have continued to focus on organic greenfield growth with the opening of new branches in  four new branches in and three new branches in these new branch locations in the past three years have allowed us to strategically penetrate deeper into many of our existing markets and enter into new markets 
additionally in october  we continued to accelerate our greenfield activity by opening two new branches bringing our branch count as of november  to in december  we acquired ford wholesale co  a distributor of residential and commercial roofing and related accessories with three locations in northern california 
this acquisition provided entry into a new geographic market with no branch overlap with our existing operations 
in november  we acquired mcclure johnston a distributor of residential and commercial roofing products and related accessories  which was headquartered in the pittsburgh area and had branches at the time of acquisition  including eight in pennsylvania  three in west virginia  one in western maryland and two in georgia 
this acquisition complemented an existing market in which we previously had operations  allowing us to capture more of the localized market share 
in july  we acquired structural materials co 
structural  a distributor of residential and commercial roofing products and related accessories headquartered in santa ana  ca 
structural has six locations in los angeles and orange counties and in the surrounding areas  which we integrated into our existing pacific supply region in southern california 
in may  we acquired enercon products inc enercon  a roofing distributor with six locations in western canada 
headquartered within its branch in edmonton  enercon also has branches in calgary  regina and saskatoon and two branches in vancouver 
this acquisition provided entry into a new geographic market with no branch overlap with our existing operations 
general we sell all materials necessary to install  replace and repair residential and non residential roofs  including shingles  single ply roofing  metal roofing and accessories  modified bitumen  built up roofing  insulation  slate and tile  fasteners  coatings and cements  and other roofing accessories 
we also sell complementary building products such as vinyl siding  doors  windows and millwork  wood and fiber cement siding  residential insulation  and waterproofing systems 
the following is a summary of our net sales by product group in thousands for the last three full fiscal years  and 
percentages may not total due to rounding 
year ended september  net sales mix net sales mix net sales mix dollars in thousands residential roofing products   non residential roofing products   complementary building products   we have over  customers  none of which individually represent more than of our total net sales 
many of our customers are small to mid size contractors with relatively limited capital resources 
we maintain strict credit review and approval policies  which has helped to keep losses from uncollectible customer receivables within our expectations 
bad debt expense in was less than due primarily to continued improvement in the economy and credit environment 
bad debt expense in was in line with our normal historical levels at approximately of net sales  while bad debts in were slightly higher than normal levels at of net sales but still within our tolerance in consideration of the recovering economy 
our expenses consist primarily of the cost of products purchased for resale  labor  fleet  occupancy  and selling and administrative expenses 
we compete for business and may respond to competitive pressures at times by lowering prices in order to maintain our market share 
we opened new branches in  four new branches in and three in while we slowed the pace of new branch openings following the economic downturn that began in  we began increasing our greenfield activity in which we expect to continue through as part of our continued growth strategy 
typically  when we open a new branch  we transfer a certain level of existing business from an existing branch to the new branch 
this allows the new branch to commence with a base business and also allows the existing branch to target other growth opportunities 
in managing our business  we consider all growth  including the opening of new branches  to be internal organic growth unless it results from an acquisition 
when we refer to growth in existing markets or internal growth  we include growth from existing and newly opened branches but exclude growth from acquired branches until they have been under our ownership for at least four full fiscal quarters at the start of the fiscal reporting period 
when we refer to regions  we are referring to our geographic regions 
at september   we had a total of branches in operation 
our existing market calculations for include branches and exclude branches because they were acquired after the start of last year 
acquired markets for include cassady pierce  structural materials  crs  mcclure johnston  ford wholesale  construction materials supply  the roofing connection and fowler peth see note to the consolidated financial statements 
when we refer to our net product costs  we are referring to our invoice cost less the impact of short term buying programs also referred to as special buys given the manner in which they are offered

net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  to billion in from billion in existing market sales increased million or based on the same number of business days 
acquired market sales increased million due to a full year s sales impact from the acquisitions and the partial year impact from our acquisitions 
we attribute the existing market sales increase primarily to the following factors better weather conditions in the fourth quarter of this year allowed for an increase in roofing activities  especially residential roofing  and strong growth in complementary building product sales 
partially offset by by heavy rains in several regions during the third quarter and fewer hail storms in  last year s very high level of re roofing activities  including the beneficial impact from mild weather in december and strong carry over business from the significant storm activity in  and a slowdown in non residential roofing activity in  primarily in the first half of the year 
in  we acquired branches  opened new branches  and closed two branches 
in  we have estimated the impact of inflation or deflation on our existing market sales and gross profit by looking at changes in our average selling prices and gross margins discussed below 
average selling prices for residential and non residential were flat overall each less than movement in compared to  while complementary product prices were up approximately 
overall  blended price increases contributed an approximate million of incremental sales in compared to additionally  we also benefited from business days in compared to in which contributed to an approximate million of year over year existing market sales growth 
we estimate the impact on existing market sales related to year over year changes in unit volume adjusted for the additional business days was a decline of approximately million 
existing market net sales by geographical region increased decreased as follows northeast  mid atlantic  southeast  southwest  midwest  west  and canada 
these variations were primarily caused by short term factors such as local economic conditions  weather conditions and storm activity that can influence the comparisons of a single geographical region 
the product group sales for our existing markets were as follows for the fiscal years ended change based on average sales change per business day net sales mix net sales mix dollars in millions residential roofing products non residential roofing products complementary building products for  our acquired markets recognized sales of  and million in residential roofing products  non residential roofing products and complementary building products  respectively

the existing market sales of  million plus the total sales from acquired markets of million agrees rounded to our reported total sales of  million 
prior year sales by product group are presented in a manner consistent with the current year s product classifications

gross profit change dollars in millions gross profit existing markets gross margin existing markets our existing market gross profit declined million  or in  while our acquired market gross profit increased million 
our overall and existing market gross margins decreased to and  in  respectively  from and in the decline in gross margin in was primarily due to product cost increases that have not been consistently passed through to customers due to the soft demand environment 
direct sales products shipped by our vendors directly to our customers  which typically have substantially lower gross margins than our warehouse sales  represented and of our net sales in and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the lower mix of non residential roofing product sales  which are more commonly facilitated by direct shipment

partially offset by lower employee benefit costs of million due primarily to lower bonus  profit sharing accruals and stock compensation expense  decreased amortization expense of million from lower amortization of intangibles  and decreased bad debt expense of million due primarily to a lower percentage of past due accounts and very low historical write offs 
in and  we expensed a total of million and million  respectively  for the amortization of intangible assets recorded under purchase accounting  including the impact from acquired markets 
our existing markets operating expenses as a percentage of the related net sales were and in and  respectively 
interest expense  financing costs and other interest expense  financing costs and other were million in compared to million in due primarily to lower debt balances in and a marginally lower effective interest rate 
the expense includes a charge of million for the recognition of the fair value of certain interest rate derivatives and million resulting from the refinancing of our debt 
these negative factors on interest expense  financing costs and other in were partially offset by the benefit from lower outstanding total debt

average selling prices were up overall in compared to  with price increases of non residential products at 
residential roofing product prices were up slightly at  while complementary product prices were up 
the higher gross margins in are an indicator that the inflation in our net product costs was less than the impact from the increase in our average selling prices

our overall and existing markets gross margins increased to and in  respectively  from in the higher gross margins in were due primarily to improved gross margins in residential roofing product sales and an increase in our mix of those residential product sales  which generally have higher gross margins than our other products 
direct sales products shipped by our vendors directly to our customers  which typically have substantially lower gross margins than our warehouse sales  represented and of our net sales in and  respectively

the income tax expense includes the beneficial impact of million  diluted earnings per share  from the reversal of the net deferred tax liability associated with a change in the tax status of our canadian operations as discussed below 
without that benefit  our effective tax rate would have been approximately in we expect our future annual income tax rate to average approximately to  excluding any discrete items 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations in general  sales and net income are highest during our first  third and fourth fiscal quarters  which represent the peak months of construction and re roofing  especially in our branches in the northern and mid western us and in canada 
we have historically incurred low net income levels or net losses during the second quarter when our sales are substantially lower 
we generally experience an increase in inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable during the third and fourth quarters of the year as a result of the seasonality of our business 
our peak cash usage generally occurs during the third quarter  primarily because accounts payable terms offered by our suppliers typically have due dates in april  may and june  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur from june through november 
we generally experience a slowing of our accounts receivable collections during our second quarter  mainly due to the inability of some of our customers to conduct their businesses effectively in inclement weather in certain of our divisions 
we continue to attempt to collect those receivables  which require payment under our standard terms 
we do not provide material concessions to our customers during this quarter of the year 
our vendors are also affected by the seasonality in the industry and are more likely to provide seasonal incentives in our second quarter as a result of the lower level of roofing activity 
we generally experience our peak working capital needs during the third quarter after we build our inventories following the winter season but before we begin collecting on most of our spring receivables

and the retirement of one of our officers  and a benefit of million million net of tax  or diluted earnings per share  for the recognition of the fair value of certain interest rate derivatives in interest expense  financing costs and other 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the economic inflation rate 
in general  we have historically been successful in passing on price increases from our vendors to our customers in a timely manner 
during  we began experiencing escalations in average inventory prices 
these increases were negligible and were effectively passed along to our customers with little impact to our net operating results 
in  pricing increases from our vendors accelerated ahead of the economic rate of inflation and we were unsuccessful in passing all increases on to our customers as a result of softer overall market conditions and extended winter weather 
as result  we absorbed the unallocated cost increases in gross profit  which drove a decline in gross margin from in to in liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at september  compared to million at september  our net working capital was million at september  compared to million at september  compared to our net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in cash from operations decreased due to the decline in net income of million  lower non cash adjustments of million and an increase in cash used by working capital changes of million  net of the impact of businesses acquired 
changes in working capital in included increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
the negative impact from those changes  however  were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and an increase accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to stronger sales activity in the fourth quarter of as compared to our days sales outstanding calculated based on the ending accounts receivable balance and the most recent quarter s sales is in line with prior year 
inventory turns were relatively flat year over year  as the impact of a higher inventory level was offset by the positive impact of higher sales 
the higher level of inventory was primarily due to our acquisitions during the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due increased accounts payable related to an increased level of inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of compared to lastly  the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was mostly due to an increase in amounts due from vendors for incentives 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million used in capital expenditures were million in compared to million in in addition  we spent million on acquisitions in compared to million in we currently expect fiscal year capital expenditures to total between to of net sales  mostly dependent upon our sales volume and exclusive of the impact of new branch openings 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to a cash use of million in in  we had net borrowings of million under our revolving credit facilities and made scheduled repayments of million under our term loan 
comparatively in  there were million of loan repayments  net of proceeds of million from our new term loan  million from new loans under our equipment financing facility and million under our new revolving lines of credit 
in connection with the new credit facility we paid million in deferred financing costs 
stock option exercises provided for proceeds of million in compared to million in compared to our net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the higher cash from operations was due to the increase in net income of million and higher non cash adjustments of million  mostly offset by more cash used by working capital changes of million  net of the impact of businesses acquired 
changes in working capital in included decreases in accounts receivable and inventories of and million  respectively 
the positive impact from those changes  however  were more than offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to improved collections from customers in as compared to our days sales outstanding calculated based on the ending accounts receivable balance and the most recent quarter s sales were down slightly due to the improvement in collections from our customers and more residential sales  which generally have shorter payment terms 
inventory turns were relatively flat year over year  as the impact of a higher inventory level was offset by the positive impact of higher sales 
the higher level of inventory was primarily due to our acquisitions during the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to a lower level of inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of compared to lastly  the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was mostly due to an increase in amounts due from vendors for incentives 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million used in capital expenditures were million in compared to million in in addition  we spent million on acquisitions in compared to million in net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million used in in  there were million of loan repayments  net of proceeds of million from our new term loan and million from new loans under our equipment financing facility 
we borrowed million under our new revolving lines of credit 
we also received million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and paid million in deferred financing costs in the financing activities in primarily reflected repayments under our credit and equipment financing facilities  net of proceeds of million from new loans under our equipment financing facility  and proceeds from exercises of stock options 
capital resources our principal source of liquidity at september  was our cash and cash equivalents of million and our available borrowings of million under revolving lines of credit  which takes into account all of the debt covenants under the credit facility see below  including the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio 
borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit in the accompanying balance sheet at september  and september  were classified as short term debt 
this was because there is no current expectation of a minimum level of outstanding revolver borrowings in the twelve months following and we paid off the september  borrowings in liquidity is defined as the current amount of readily available cash and the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the current needs for cash 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities  taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business 
our cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid money market funds which invest primarily in commercial paper or bonds with a rating of a or better  and bank certificates of deposit 
significant factors which could affect future liquidity include the following the adequacy of available bank lines of credit  the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms  cash flows generated from operating activities  acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
our primary capital needs are for working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations and cash equivalents  supplemented by bank borrowings 
in the past  we have paid for acquisitions from cash on hand or financed them initially through increased bank borrowings  the issuance of common stock and or other borrowings 
we then repay any such borrowings with cash flows from operations 
we have funded our past capital expenditures through increased bank borrowings  including equipment financing  or through capital leases  and then have reduced these obligations with cash flows from operations 
we believe we have adequate current liquidity and availability of capital to fund our present operations  meet our commitments on our existing debt and fund anticipated growth  including expansion in existing and targeted market areas 
we continually seek potential acquisitions and from time to time hold discussions with acquisition candidates 
if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing  we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a strong base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms  as we have in the past 
we may also issue additional shares of common stock to raise funds  which we last did in december  or we may issue preferred stock 
monitoring and assessing collectability of accounts receivable we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral  although we typically obtain payment and performance bonds for any type of public work and have the ability to lien projects under certain circumstances 
consistent with industry practices  we require payment from most customers within days  except for sales to our commercial roofing contractors  which we typically require to pay in days 
as our business is seasonal in certain geographic regions  our customers businesses are also seasonal 
sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time 
throughout the year  we closely monitor our receivables and record estimated reserves based upon our judgment of specific customer situations  aging of accounts and our historical write offs of uncollectible accounts 
our regional credit offices are staffed to manage and monitor our receivable aging balances and our systems allow us to enforce pre determined credit approval levels and properly leverage new business 
the credit pre approval process denotes the maximum requested credit amount that each level of management can approve  with the highest credit amount requiring approval by our ceo and cfo 
there are daily communications with branch and field staff 
our regional offices conduct periodic reviews with their branch managers  various regional management staff and the vp credit 
depending on the state of the respective region s receivables  these reviews can be weekly  bi weekly or monthly 
additionally  the regions are required to submit a monthly receivable forecast to the vp credit 
on a monthly basis  the vp credit will review and discuss these forecasts  as well as a prior month recap  with the ceo and cfo 
periodically  we perform a specific analysis of all accounts past due and write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote based upon the following factors aging statistics and trends  customer payment history  review of the customer s financial statements when available  independent credit reports  and discussions with customers 
we still pursue collection of amounts written off in certain circumstances and credit the allowance for any subsequent recoveries 
in the past  annual bad debt expense has averaged between and of net sales 
in  bad debt expense declined to less than of net sales 
comparatively in  bad debt expense was of net sales 
the continued reduction in bad debt expense year over year is primarily attributed to the continued economic recovery and credit environment 
indebtedness we currently have the following credit facilities a senior secured credit facility in the united states  a canadian senior secured credit facility  and an equipment financing facility 
senior secured credit facility on april   we replaced our prior credit facility with a new five year senior secured credit facility that includes a million us credit facility individually  the us credit facility and a c million million canadian credit facility individually  the canadian revolver with wells fargo bank  national association  and a syndicate of other lenders combined  the credit facility 
we paid off debt of million that was outstanding under the prior credit facility with the proceeds from the credit facility and from approximately million of cash on hand 
the million u 
s credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility of million the us revolver  which includes a sub facility of million for letters of credit  and a million term loan the term loan 
the term loan has required amortization of per year that is payable in quarterly installments  with the balance due on march  we may increase the credit facility by up to million under certain conditions 
there was million  million c million and million outstanding under the us revolver  canadian revolver and term loan  respectively  at september  there were million of outstanding standby letters of credit at september  interest borrowings under the credit facility carry interest at a margin above the libor rate 
the margin is currently per annum and can range from to per annum depending upon our consolidated total leverage ratio  as defined in the credit facility

in addition  the canadian credit facility permits borrowings under a base rate  defined in the agreement as the higher of the canadian prime rate  or the annual rate of interest equal to the sum of the cdor rate plus  plus a margin above that rate 
the margin for both base rates is currently per annum and can range from to per annum depending upon our consolidated total leverage ratio  as defined in the credit facility 
current unused commitment fees on the revolving credit facilities are per annum 
the unused commitment fees can range from to per annum  again depending upon our consolidated total leverage ratio 
as of september   outstanding borrowings under the us revolver carried an interest rate of libor plus at september  while outstanding borrowings under the canadian revolver carried an interest rate of canadian prime plus at september  
borrowings under the term loan carried an interest rate of libor plus at september  
financial covenants under the credit facility are as follows maximum consolidated total leverage ratio on the last day of each fiscal quarter  our consolidated total leverage ratio the ratio of our outstanding debt to our trailing twelve month earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation  as more fully defined in the credit facility  must not be greater than  or under a one time request by us subsequent to an acquisition that meets the requirements under the credit facility 
at september   this ratio was minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio on the last day of each fiscal quarter  our consolidated interest coverage ratio the ratio of our trailing twelve month earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation to our cash interest expense for the same period  as more fully defined in the credit facility  must not be less than at september   this ratio was as of september   we were in compliance with these covenants 
substantially all of our assets  including the capital stock and assets of wholly owned subsidiaries  secure obligations under the credit facility 
equipment financing facilities as of september   there was a total of million outstanding under prior equipment financing facilities  with fixed interest rates ranging from to and payments due through june the company s current facility provides for up to million of purchased transportation and material handling equipment through october  the applicable interest rate at the time of the advances will be approximately above the year term swap rate for year loans and above the year term swap rate for year loans 
no further amounts can be drawn on prior facilities 
contractual obligations at september   contractual obligations were as follows fiscal years dollars in millions thereafter senior bank debt and revolver equipment financing operating leases interest non cancelable purchase obligations total interest payments reflect all currently scheduled amounts along with projected amounts to be paid under the senior bank debt as calculated using the current libor rate at september  for all future periods 
in general  we purchase products under purchase obligations that are cancelable by us without cost or expire after days 
capital expenditures we incurred capital expenditures of  and million in  and  respectively 
typically  over of our capital expenditures have generally been made for transportation and material handling equipment 
we currently expect future annual capital expenditures to be approximately to of net sales  exclusive of the impact of new branch openings and assuming improved economic and industry conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the accurate portrayal of a company financial condition and results and require subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  commonly referred to as us gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations 
we have identified the following accounting policies that require us to make the most subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we account for employee and non employee director stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting 
compensation cost arising from stock options and restricted stock awards granted to employees and non employee directors is recognized using the straight line method over the vesting period  which represents the requisite service or performance period 
in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation  we estimate option forfeitures and project the number of restricted shares and units that are expected to vest based on the related performance measures 
in addition  we report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as both a financing cash inflow and an operating cash outflow 
the excess tax benefit classified as a financing activity would have been classified as an operating inflow if we did not use the fair value method 
interest rate swaps we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the risks and costs associated with financing activities  as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
the swap agreements are contracts to exchange variable rate for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreements 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we record the effective portions of changes in their fair value  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
the effectiveness of the hedges is periodically assessed by management during the lives of the hedges by comparing the current terms of the hedges with the related hedged debt to assure they continue to coincide and through an evaluation of the ability of the counterparties to the hedges to honor their obligations under the hedges 
any ineffective portions of the hedges are recognized in earnings through interest expense  financing costs and other 
our refinancing transaction on april   resulted in hedge ineffectiveness on the derivative instruments that expired in april  as the underlying term debt being hedged was repaid before the expiration of the derivative instruments 
this resulted in a charge to interest expense  financing costs and other in the third quarter of for the fair value of the derivative instruments previously recorded as a component of comprehensive loss 
subsequent changes in the fair value of those swaps are also being recognized in interest expense  financing costs and other 
our derivative instrument entered into in is designated as a cash flow hedge  for which we record the effective portions of changes in its fair value  net of tax  in other comprehensive income 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we charge write offs against our allowance for doubtful accounts  although we still pursue collection in certain circumstances and credit the allowance for any subsequent recoveries 
inventory valuation product inventories represent one of our largest assets and are recorded at net realizable value 
our goal is to manage our inventory so that we minimize out of stock positions 
to do this  we maintain an adequate inventory of up to  skus at each branch based on sales history 
at the same time  we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory 
we monitor our inventory levels by branch and record provisions for excess inventories based on slower moving inventory 
we define potential excess inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the historical usage  excluding items purchased in the last three months 
we then review our most recent history of sales and adjustments of such excess inventory and apply our judgment as to forecasted demand and other factors  including liquidation value  to determine the required adjustments to net realizable value 
in addition  at the end of each year  we evaluate our inventory at each branch and write off and dispose of obsolete products 
our inventories are generally not susceptible to technological obsolescence 
during the year  we perform periodic cycle counts and write off excess or damaged inventory as needed 
at year end  we take a physical inventory and record any necessary additional write offs 
vendor rebates typical arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount after we achieve any of a number of measures generally related to the volume of our purchases over a period of time 
we reserve these rebates to effectively reduce our cost of sales in the period in which we sell the product 
throughout the year  we estimate the amount of rebates receivable for the periodic programs based upon the expected level of purchases 
we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels 
historically  our actual rebates have been within our expectations used for our estimates 
if we fail to achieve a measure which is required to obtain a vendor rebate  we will have to record a charge in the period in which we determine the criteria or measure for the vendor rebate will not be met to the extent the vendor rebate was estimated and included as a reduction to costs of sales 
if market conditions were to change  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to products already purchased  it may impact our gross margin on products we sell or revenues earned in future periods 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize revenue at the point of sale or upon delivery to the customer site 
for goods shipped by third party carriers  we recognize revenue upon shipment since the terms are fob shipping point 
approximately of our revenues are for products delivered by us or picked up by our customers at our facilities  which provides for timely and accurate revenue recognition 
we also ship certain products directly from the manufacturer to the customer 
revenues are recognized upon notifications of deliveries from our vendors 
delays in receiving delivery notifications could impact our financial results  although it has not been material to our consolidated results of operations in the past 
we also provide certain job site delivery services  which include crane rentals and rooftop deliveries of certain products  for which the associated revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
these revenues represent less than of our net sales 
all revenues recognized are net of sales taxes collected  allowances for discounts and estimated returns  which are provided for at the time of pick up or delivery 
in the past  customer returns have not been material to our consolidated results of operations 
all sales taxes collected are subsequently remitted to the appropriate government authorities 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires us to recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities to the extent that they are realizable 
deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
fasb asc topic  income taxes asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
based on this guidance  we analyze our filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based solely on its technical merits 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
examples of such indicators include a significant change in the business climate  unexpected competition  loss of key personnel or a decline in our market capitalization below our net book value 
we perform a qualitative assessment based on economic  industry and company specific factors as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment test for all or selected reporting units 
based on the results of the qualitative assessment  companies are only required to perform step of the annual impairment test for a reporting unit if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount  the two step approach is applied 
the first step would require a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component ie a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by component managers 
we currently have five components which we evaluate for aggregation 
we evaluate the distribution methods  sales mix  and operating results of each of our components to determine if these characteristics have or will be sustained over a long term basis 
for purposes of this evaluation  we would expect our components to exhibit similar economic characteristics years after events such as an acquisition within our core roofing business or management business restructuring 
this evaluation also considers major storm activity or local economic challenges that may impact the short term operations of an individual component 
components that exhibit similar economic characteristic are subsequently aggregated into a single reporting unit 
based on our evaluation at august   it was determined that all of our components exhibited similar economic characteristics and therefore were aggregated into a single reporting unit collectively the reporting unit 
we concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit has more likely than not exceeded its respective carrying value at the goodwill measurement date 
this position is consistent with the operating results in which sales for the reporting unit exceeded those in the prior year by 
the company noted that operating income as compared to prior year decreased by 
the decrease in the operating margin reflects short term pricing pressure experienced by the company 
we expect the reporting unit to experience moderate growth in the near future 
our analysis further noted the total market capitalization exceeded the company s carrying value by approximately at august  this compares to and for that same measure at august  and  respectively 
in addition  we did not identify any macroeconomic or industry conditions or cost related factors that would indicate the fair value of the reporting unit was more likely than not to be less than its respective carrying value 
lastly  there have been no events or circumstances since the date of the above assessments that would change our conclusion 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit under the guidelines discussed above has fallen below its carrying values  we would test such reporting unit for impairment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our on going business operations 
our primary exposure includes changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to the variable rate borrowings under our credit facility 
the following discussion of our interest rate swaps see financial derivatives below is based on a change in interest rates 
these changes are hypothetical scenarios used to calibrate potential risk and do not represent our view of future market changes 
as the hypothetical figures discussed below indicate  changes in fair value based on the assumed change in rates generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
the effect of a variation in a particular assumption is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
at september   we had and million of outstanding term loans and revolver borrowings  respectively  under our credit facility  and million of equipment financing outstanding 
borrowings under our credit facility incur interest on a floating rate basis while borrowings under our equipment lease facilities incur interest on a fixed rate basis 
in connection with the placement of our credit facility  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount equal to our outstanding term loan that effectively converts our floating rate interest under the term loan to a fixed rate of 
in consideration of our hedging instruments  as of september   only the million of borrowings under our revolvers were subject to variable floating interest rates 
as of november   the borrowings under our revolvers have been repaid in full 
as of september   our weighted average effective interest rate was on total debt outstanding  compared to on total debt outstanding at september  at september   a hypothetical increase in interest rates in effect at that date would have increased annual interest expense by million 
as discussed above  enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the risks and costs associated with financing activities  as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
the swap agreements discussed below are to effectively exchange variable rate for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreements 
the aggregate fair value of these swaps represented an unrealized loss of million at september  a hypothetical increase or decrease of in interest rates from the level in effect at september   would result in an aggregate unrealized gain or loss in value of the swaps of less than million or million 
financial derivatives we use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure related to fluctuating cash flows from changes in interest rates 
use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects us to certain risks  such as market and credit risks 
market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative instrument will change 
in a hedging relationship  the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
credit risk related to derivatives represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract 
the notional  or contractual  amount of our derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent our exposure due to credit risk 
our current derivative instruments are with large financial counterparties rated highly by nationally recognized credit rating agencies 
we use interest rate derivative instruments to manage the risk related to fluctuating cash flows from interest rate changes by converting a portion of its variable rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings 
as noted above  as of september  our outstanding interest rate derivative instruments included a million interest rate swap with interest payments at a fixed rate of  this interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and amortizes at million per quarter and expires on march  for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we record the effective portions of changes in their fair value  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
the effectiveness of the hedges is periodically assessed by management during the lives of the hedges by comparing the current terms of the hedges with the related hedged debt to assure they continue to coincide and through an evaluation of the ability of the counterparties to the hedges to honor their obligations under the hedges 
any ineffective portions of the hedges are recognized in earnings through interest expense  financing costs and other 
our refinancing transaction on april  resulted in hedge ineffectiveness on the derivative instruments that expired in april  as the underlying term debt being hedged was repaid before the expiration of the derivative instruments 
this resulted in a million charge to interest expense  financing costs and other in the third quarter of for the fair value of the derivative instruments previously recorded as a component of comprehensive loss 
subsequent changes in the fair value of those swaps were recognized in interest expense  financing costs and other 
we record any differences paid or received on its interest rate hedges as adjustments to interest expense  financing costs and other

approximately of our revenues in were derived from sales to customers in canada 
this business is primarily conducted in the local currency 
this exposes us to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can adversely affect revenues  net income and cash flows 
we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk
