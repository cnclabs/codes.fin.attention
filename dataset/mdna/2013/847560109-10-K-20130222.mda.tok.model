item a 
risk factors 
discussed below are the material risk factors relating to spectra energy 
reductions in demand for natural gas and low market prices of commodities adversely affect our operations and cash flows 
our regulated businesses are generally economically stable and are not significantly affected in the short term by changing commodity prices 
however  all of our businesses can be negatively affected in the long term by sustained downturns in the economy or long term conservation efforts  which could affect long term demand and market prices for natural gas and ngls  all of which are beyond our control and could impair the ability to meet long term goals 
most of our revenues are based on regulated tariff rates  which include the recovery of certain fuel costs 
however  lower overall economic output would cause a decline in the volume of natural gas transported and distributed or gathered and processed at our plants  resulting in lower earnings and cash flows 
this decline would primarily affect distribution revenues in the short term 
transmission revenues could be affected by long term economic declines that result in the non renewal of long term contracts at the time of expiration 
lower demand for natural gas and lower prices for natural gas and ngls could result from multiple factors that affect the markets where we operate  including weather conditions  such as abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy usage for heating or cooling purposes  respectively  supply of and demand for energy commodities  including any decreases in the production of natural gas which could negatively affect our processing and transmission businesses due to lower throughput  capacity and transmission service into  or out of  our markets  and petrochemical demand for ngls 
the lack of availability of natural gas resources may cause customers to seek alternative energy resources  which could materially affect our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
our natural gas businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production and reserves 
prices for natural gas  regulatory limitations on the development of natural gas supplies  or a shift in supply sources could adversely affect development of additional reserves and production that are accessible by our pipeline  gathering  processing and distribution assets 
lack of commercial quantities of natural gas available to these assets could cause customers to seek alternative energy resources  thereby reducing their reliance on our services  which in turn would materially affect our revenues  earnings and cash flows 
investments and projects located in canada expose us to fluctuations in currency rates that may affect our results of operations  cash flows and compliance with debt covenants 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk from our canadian operations 
an average devaluation in the canadian dollar exchange rate during would have resulted in an estimated net loss on the translation of 
table of contents local currency earnings of approximately million on our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  if a devaluation had occurred on december   the consolidated balance sheet would have been negatively impacted by million through a cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
at december   one us dollar translated into canadian dollars 
in addition  we maintain credit facilities that typically include financial covenants which limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital for spectra energy or of a specific subsidiary 
failure to maintain these covenants could preclude us from issuing commercial paper or letters of credit or borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and could require other affiliates to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under other revolving credit agreements  which could affect cash flows or restrict business 
foreign currency fluctuations have a direct impact on our ability to maintain certain of these financial covenants 
natural gas gathering and processing  ngl processing and marketing  and market based storage operations are subject to commodity price risk  which could result in a decrease in our earnings and reduced cash flows 
we have gathering and processing operations that consist of contracts to buy and sell commodities  including contracts for natural gas  ngls and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
we are exposed to market price fluctuations of ngls and natural gas primarily in field services and at empress  and to oil primarily in our field services segment 
the effect of commodity price fluctuations to our earnings could be material 
we have market based rates for some of our storage operations and sell our storage services based on natural gas market spreads and volatility 
if natural gas market spreads or volatility deviate from historical norms or there is significant growth in the amount of storage capacity available to natural gas markets relative to demand  our approach to managing our market based storage contract portfolio may not protect us from significant variations in storage revenues  including possible declines  as contracts renew 
our business is subject to extensive regulation that affects our operations and costs 
our us assets and operations are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities  including regulation by the ferc and by various authorities under federal  state and local environmental laws 
our natural gas assets and operations in canada are also subject to regulation by federal  provincial and local authorities  including the neb and the oeb  and by various federal and provincial authorities under environmental laws 
regulation affects almost every aspect of our business  including  among other things  the ability to determine terms and rates for services provided by some of our businesses  make acquisitions  construct  expand and operate facilities  issue equity or debt securities  and pay dividends 
in addition  regulators in both the united states and canada have taken actions to strengthen market forces in the gas pipeline industry  which have led to increased competition 
in a number of key markets  natural gas pipeline and storage operators are facing competitive pressure from a number of new industry participants  such as alternative suppliers  as well as traditional pipeline competitors 
increased competition driven by regulatory changes could have a material effect on our business  earnings  financial condition and cash flows 
execution of our capital projects subjects us to construction risks  increases in labor and material costs  and other risks that may affect our financial results 
a significant portion of our growth is accomplished through the construction of new pipelines and storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities 
construction of these facilities is subject to various regulatory  development  operational and market risks  including the ability to obtain necessary approvals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms and to maintain those approvals and permits issued and satisfy the terms and conditions imposed therein  the availability of skilled labor  equipment  and materials to complete expansion projects  
table of contents potential changes in federal  state and local statutes and regulations  including environmental requirements  that may prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project  impediments on our ability to acquire rights of way or land rights on a timely basis and on acceptable terms  the ability to construct projects within anticipated costs  including the risk of cost overruns resulting from inflation or increased costs of equipment  materials or labor  weather  geologic conditions or other factors beyond our control  that may be material  and general economic factors that affect the demand for natural gas infrastructure 
any of these risks could prevent a project from proceeding  delay its completion or increase its anticipated cost 
as a result  new facilities may not achieve their expected investment return  which could affect our earnings  financial position and cash flows 
gathering and processing  transmission and storage  and distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect our operations 
there are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in natural gas gathering and processing  transmission  storage  and distribution activities  such as leaks  explosions  mechanical problems  activities of third parties and damage to pipelines  facilities and equipment caused by hurricanes  tornadoes  floods  fires and other natural disasters  that could cause substantial financial losses 
in addition  these risks could result in significant injury  loss of life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution and impairment of operations  any of which could result in substantial losses 
for pipeline and storage assets located near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers  industrial sites and other public gathering areas  the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater 
we do not maintain insurance coverage against all of these risks and losses  and any insurance coverage we might maintain may not fully cover the damages caused by those risks and losses 
therefore  should any of these risks materialize  it could have a material effect on our business  earnings  financial condition and cash flows 
we are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations  compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures  increase our cost of operations and affect or limit our business plans 
our interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulation administered by the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa of the us department of transportation 
these laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design  construction  maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines 
these regulations  among other things  include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of our pipelines 
the regulations determine the pressures at which our pipelines can operate 
in  serious pipeline incidents on systems unrelated to ours focused the attention of congress and the public on pipeline safety 
legislative proposals have been introduced in congress that would strengthen the phmsa s enforcement and penalty authority  and expand the scope of its oversight 
in august  phmsa initiated an advance notice of proposed rulemaking announcing its consideration of substantial revisions in its regulations to increase pipeline safety 
phmsa also has issued guidance that states it will focus near term enforcement efforts on recordkeeping and integrity management following urgent recommendations by the national transportation safety board related to pipeline pressure and recordkeeping 
on january   the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty  and job creation act of was signed into law 
this act the psa amendments amends the pipeline safety act in a number of significant ways  including authorizing phmsa to assess higher penalties for violations of its regulations  requiring phmsa to adopt appropriate regulations within two years requiring the use of automatic or remote controlled shutoff valves on new or rebuilt pipeline facilities and to perform a study on the application of such technology to existing pipeline facilities in high consequence areas hcas  
table of contents requiring operators of pipelines to verify maximum allowable operating pressure and report exceedances within five days  requiring phmsa to study and report on the adequacy of soil cover requirements in hcas  and requiring phmsa to evaluate in detail whether integrity management requirements should be expanded to pipeline segments outside of hcas where the requirements currently apply 
these legislative changes  when implemented  will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations 
it is still uncertain what regulatory changes phmsa will propose as a result of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking  but phmsa has begun to undertake the various requirements imposed on it by the psa amendments 
in this climate of increasingly stringent regulation  pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by phmsa  which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines 
should any of these risks materialize  it may have a material effect on our operations  earnings  financial condition and cash flows 
we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations  compliance with which can require significant capital expenditures  increase our cost of operations and may affect or limit our business plans  or expose us to environmental liabilities 
we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations  including air emissions  water quality  wastewater discharges  solid waste and hazardous waste 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating and other costs 
these laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  inspections and other approvals 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures  including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties 
we currently estimate that compliance with major clean air act regulatory programs will cause us to incur capital expenditures of approximately million through to obtain permits  evaluate offsite impacts of our operations  install pollution control equipment  and otherwise assure compliance 
the precise nature of these compliance obligations at each of our facilities has not been finally determined and may depend in part on future regulatory changes 
in addition  compliance with new and emerging environmental regulatory programs is likely to significantly increase our operating costs compared to historical levels 
failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines  penalties and injunctive measures affecting our operating assets 
in addition  changes in environmental laws and regulations or the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations could result in a material increase in our cost of compliance with such laws and regulations 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for our operating assets or development projects 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals  if we fail to obtain or comply with them or if environmental laws or regulations change or are administered in a more stringent manner  the operations of facilities or the development of new facilities could be prevented  delayed or become subject to additional costs 
no assurance can be made that the costs that may be incurred to comply with environmental regulations in the future will not have a material effect on our earnings and cash flows 
the enactment of future climate change legislation could result in increased operating costs and delays in obtaining necessary permits for our capital projects 
the current international climate framework  the united nations sponsored kyoto protocol  prescribes specific targets to reduce ghg emissions for developed countries for the period 
the kyoto protocol expired in and had not been signed by the united states 
united nations sponsored international negotiations were held in durban  south africa in december with the intent of defining a future agreement for and beyond 
a non binding agreement was reached to develop a roadmap aimed at creating a global agreement on climate action to be implemented by 
table of contents the united states is a party to the durban agreement 
in the interim period before  the kyoto protocol will continue in effect  although it is expected that not all of the current parties will choose to commit for this extended period 
in the united states  climate change action is evolving at state  regional and federal levels 
pursuant to federal law  we are currently subject to an obligation to report our ghg emissions  but are not currently subject to limits on emissions of ghgs 
in addition  a number of canadian provinces and us states have joined regional greenhouse gas initiatives  and a number are developing their own programs that would mandate reductions in ghg emissions 
however  as the key details of future ghg restrictions and compliance mechanisms remain undefined  the likely future effects on our business are highly uncertain 
in may  the epa issued the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule tailoring rule 
this regulation establishes that the construction of new or modification of existing major sources of ghg emissions would become subject to the psd air permitting program and later  the title v permitting program beginning in january  although the regulation also significantly increases the emissions thresholds that would subject facilities to these regulations 
in june  these regulations  along with other ghg regulations and determinations issued by the epa  were upheld by the dc circuit of appeals 
in july  the epa determined in step of the tailoring rule process that it would maintain the current ghg emissions thresholds for psd and title v applicability 
this rule has also been appealed 
we anticipate that in the future  new capital projects or modification of existing projects could be subject to a permit requirement related to ghg emissions that may result in delays in completing such projects 
due to the speculative outlook regarding any us federal and state policies and the uncertainty of the canadian federal and provincial policies  we cannot estimate the potential effect of proposed ghg policies on our future consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
however  such legislation or regulation could materially increase our operating costs  require material capital expenditures or create additional permitting  which could delay proposed construction projects 
we are involved in numerous legal proceedings  the outcome of which are uncertain  and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our earnings  financial condition and cash flows 
we are subject to numerous legal proceedings 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance 
it is reasonably possible that the final resolution of some of the matters in which we are involved could require additional expenditures  in excess of established reserves  over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could have a material effect on our earnings and cash flows 
we rely on access to short term and long term capital markets to finance capital requirements and support liquidity needs  and access to those markets can be affected  particularly if we or our rated subsidiaries are unable to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which could affect our cash flows or restrict business 
our business is financed to a large degree through debt 
the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from assets 
accordingly  we rely on access to both short term and long term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt 
our senior unsecured long term debt is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies 
if the rating agencies were to rate us or our rated subsidiaries below investment grade  our borrowing costs would increase  perhaps significantly 
consequently  we would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings and our potential pool of investors and funding sources could decrease 

table of contents we maintain revolving credit facilities to provide back up for commercial paper programs for borrowings and or letters of credit at various entities 
these facilities typically include financial covenants which limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity 
failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude that entity from issuing commercial paper or letters of credit or borrowing under the revolving credit facility and could require other affiliates to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under other revolving credit agreements  which could affect cash flows or restrict business 
furthermore  if spectra energy s short term debt rating were to be below tier for example  a for standard and poor s  p for moody s investor service and f for fitch ratings  access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited 
although this would not affect our ability to draw under our credit facilities  borrowing costs could be significantly higher 
if we are not able to access capital at competitive rates  our ability to finance operations and implement our strategy may be affected 
restrictions on our ability to access financial markets may also affect our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled 
an inability to access capital may limit our ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that we may otherwise rely on for future growth 
any downgrade or other event negatively affecting the credit ratings of our subsidiaries could make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited  which in turn could increase our need to provide liquidity in the form of capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries  thus reducing the liquidity and borrowing availability of the consolidated group 
we may be unable to secure renewals of long term transportation agreements  which could expose our transportation volumes and revenues to increased volatility 
we may be unable to secure renewals of long term transportation agreements in the future for our natural gas transmission business as a result of economic factors  lack of commercial gas supply available to our systems  changing gas supply flow patterns in north america  increased competition or changes in regulation 
without long term transportation agreements  our revenues and contract volumes would be exposed to increased volatility 
the inability to secure these agreements would materially affect our business  earnings  financial condition and cash flows 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our business 
generally  our customers are rated investment grade  are otherwise considered creditworthy or provide us security to satisfy credit concerns 
approximately of our credit exposures for transportation  storage  and gathering and processing services are with customers who have an investment grade rating or the equivalent based on our evaluation or are secured by collateral 
however  we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy  including possible declines in our customers creditworthiness 
as a result of future capital projects for which natural gas producers may be the primary customer  the percentage of our customers who are rated investment grade may decline 
while we monitor these situations carefully and take appropriate measures when deemed necessary  it is possible that customer payment defaults  if significant  could have a material effect on our earnings and cash flows 
native land claims have been asserted in british columbia and alberta  which could affect future access to public lands  and the success of these claims could have a significant effect on natural gas production and processing 
certain aboriginal groups have claimed aboriginal and treaty rights over a substantial portion of public lands on which our facilities in british columbia and alberta  and the gas supply areas served by those facilities  are located 
the existence of these claims  which range from the assertion of rights of limited use to aboriginal title  has given rise to some uncertainty regarding access to public lands for future development purposes 
such claims  if successful  could have a significant effect on natural gas production in british columbia and alberta  
table of contents which could have a material effect on the volume of natural gas processed at our facilities and of ngls and other products transported in the associated pipelines 
in addition  certain aboriginal groups in ontario have claimed aboriginal and treaty rights in areas where union gas dawn storage and transmission assets are located and also in areas where the dawn trafalgar pipeline route is located 
the existence of these claims could give rise to future uncertainty regarding land tenure depending upon their negotiated outcomes 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these claims or the effect they may ultimately have on our business and operations 
protecting against potential terrorist activities requires significant capital expenditures and a successful terrorist attack could affect our business 
acts of terrorism and any possible reprisals as a consequence of any action by the united states and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the united states 
this risk is particularly high for companies  like us  operating in any energy infrastructure industry that handle volatile gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons 
the potential for terrorism  including cyber terrorism  has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material effect on our business 
in particular  we may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for our facilities and pipelines  such as additional physical facility and pipeline security  and additional security personnel 
moreover  any physical damage to high profile facilities resulting from acts of terrorism may not be covered  or covered fully  by insurance 
we may be required to expend material amounts of capital to repair any facilities  the expenditure of which could affect our business and cash flows 
changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
moreover  the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital 
poor investment performance of our pension plan holdings and other factors affecting pension plan costs could affect our earnings  financial position and liquidity 
our costs of providing defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors  such as the rates of return on plan assets  discount rates used to measure pension liabilities  actuarial gains and losses  future government regulation and our contributions made to the plans 
without sustained growth in the pension plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets  and depending upon the other factors impacting our costs as listed above  we could experience net asset  expense and funding volatility 
this volatility could have a material effect on our earnings and cash flows
