management closely tracks the following financial criteria to evaluate current business operations and future prospects royalties  leasing activity  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
our most profitable source of franchising revenue is royalties received from our franchise partners 
during  our royalties increased million or compared to during  we purchased million in equipment for lease customers compared to million in overall  our leasing portfolio net investment in leases current and long term increased to million at december  from million at december  leasing income net of leasing expense in was million compared to million in the same period last year 
fluctuations in period to period leasing income and leasing expense result primarily from the manner and timing in which leasing income and leasing expense is recognized over the term of each particular lease in accordance with accounting guidance applicable to leasing 
for this reason  we believe that more meaningful levels of leasing activity are the purchases of equipment for lease customers and the medium to long term trend in the size of the leasing portfolio 
management continually monitors the level and timing of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the major components of selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  wages and benefits  advertising  travel  occupancy  legal and professional fees 
during  selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
management also monitors several nonfinancial factors in evaluating the current business operations and future prospects including franchise openings and closings and franchise renewals

this percentage of renewal has ranged between and during the last three years 
our ability to grow our operating income is dependent on our ability to i effectively support our franchise partners so that they produce higher revenues  ii open new franchises  iii increase lease originations and minimize write offs in our leasing portfolios  and iv control our selling  general and administrative expenses

in addition  as part of an impairment analysis at december  we determined that the carrying value of our investment was not expected to be recoverable from the future cash flows of the tomsten business or the sale of our ownership stake

segment reporting is intended to give financial statement users a better view of how we manage and evaluate our businesses

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash flow from operations and borrowings 
the components of the consolidated statement of operations that reduce our net income but do not affect our liquidity include non cash items for depreciation  compensation expense related to stock options  loss from and impairment of equity investments and impairment of investment in notes

see note shareholders equity 
we have future operating lease commitments for our corporate headquarters 
as of december   we had no other material outstanding commitments 
see note commitments and contingencies 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
we have a revolving credit facility with the privatebank and trust company and bmo harris bank na the line of credit 
the line of credit  which has a termination date of february   has been and will continue to be used for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the line of credit are subject to certain borrowing base limitations  and the line of credit is secured by a lien against substantially all of our assets  contains customary financial conditions and covenants  and requires maintenance of minimum levels of debt service coverage and tangible net worth and maximum levels of leverage all as defined within the line of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants and our borrowing availability under the line of credit was million the lesser of the borrowing base or the aggregate line of credit 
there were million in borrowings outstanding under the line of credit bearing interest ranging from to  leaving million available for additional borrowings 

table of contents the line of credit allows us to choose between three interest rate options in connection with our borrowings 
the interest rate options are the base rate  libor and fixed rate all as defined within the line of credit plus an applicable margin of  and  respectively 
interest periods for libor borrowings can be one  two or three months  and interest periods for fixed rate borrowings can be one  two  three or four years as selected by us 
the line of credit also provides for non utilization fees of per annum on the daily average of the unused commitment 
we may utilize discounted lease financing to provide funds for a portion of our leasing activities 
rates for discounted lease financing reflect prevailing market interest rates and the credit standing of the lessees for which the payment stream of the leases are discounted 
we believe that discounted lease financing will continue to be available to us at competitive rates of interest through the relationships we have established with financial institutions 
we believe that the combination of our cash on hand  the cash generated from our franchising business  cash generated from discounting sources and our line of credit will be adequate to fund our planned operations  including leasing activity  through critical accounting policies the company prepares the consolidated financial statements of winmark corporation and subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the critical accounting policies that the company believes are most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results include the following revenue recognition royalty revenue and franchise fees the company collects royalties from each retail franchise based on a percentage of retail store gross sales 
the company recognizes royalties as revenue when earned 
at the end of each accounting period  estimates of royalty amounts due are made based on applying historical weekly sales information to the number of weeks of unreported franchisee sales 
if there are significant changes in the actual performance of franchisees versus the company s estimates  its royalty revenue would be impacted 
during  the company collected  more than it estimated at december  as of december   the company s royalty receivable was  the company collects initial franchise fees when franchise agreements are signed and recognizes the initial franchise fees as revenue when the franchise is opened  which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement 
franchise fees collected from franchisees but not yet recognized as income are recorded as deferred revenue in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   deferred franchise fees were  
table of contents leasing income recognition leasing income for direct financing leases is recognized under the effective interest method 
the effective interest method of income recognition applies a constant rate of interest equal to the internal rate of return on the lease 
generally  when a lease is more than days delinquent when more than three monthly payments are owed  the lease is classified as being on non accrual and the company stops recognizing leasing income on that date 
payments received on leases in non accrual status generally reduce the lease receivable 
leases on non accrual status remain classified as such until there is sustained payment performance that  in the company s judgment  would indicate that all contractual amounts will be collected in full 
in certain circumstances  the company may re lease equipment in its existing portfolio 
as this equipment may have a fair value greater than its carrying amount when re leased  the company may be required to account for the lease as a sales type lease 
at inception of a sales type lease  revenue is recorded that consists of the present value of the future minimum lease payments discounted at the rate implicit in the lease 
in subsequent periods  the recording of income is consistent with the accounting for a direct financing lease 
for leases that are accounted for as operating leases  income is recognized on a straight line basis when payments under the lease contract are due 
allowance for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses at an amount that it believes to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in its existing lease portfolio as of the reporting dates 
leases are collectively evaluated for potential loss 
the company s methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses includes consideration of the level of delinquencies and non accrual leases  historical net charge off amounts and review of any significant concentrations 
a provision is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the appropriate level 
if the actual results are different from the company s estimates  results could be different 
the company s policy is to charge off against the allowance the estimated unrecoverable portion of accounts once they reach days delinquent 
see note investment in leasing operations 
stock based compensation the company currently uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include implied volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the company evaluates the assumptions used to value awards on an annual basis 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if the company decides to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income  net income and earnings per share 

table of contents impairment of long term investments the company evaluates its long term equity investments for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the impairment  if any  is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value as prescribed by applicable accounting guidance  based on the best information available  including market prices  discounted cash flow analysis or other financial metrics that management utilizes to help determine fair value 
judgments made by management related to the fair value of its long term equity investments are affected by factors such as the ongoing financial performance of the investees  additional capital raised by the investees as well as general changes in the economy 
if there are significant changes in the actual performance of the long term equity investments versus the company s estimates  the carrying values of these investments could be significantly impacted 
the company evaluates its long term note investments for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the notes 
the impairment  if any  is measured by the difference between the recorded investment in the notes  including accrued interest  and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the notes as prescribed by applicable accounting guidance  based on the best information available to management 
once a note investment is deemed impaired  any significant change in the amount or timing of the expected or actual cash flows requires recalculation of the impairment applying the procedures described above 
see note long term investments for the company s discussion of its impaired note investment 
estimates and assumptions made by management related to the expected future cash flows from the notes could be different than the actual cash flows  which could significantly impact the carrying value of these investments
