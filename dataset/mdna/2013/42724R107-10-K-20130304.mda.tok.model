item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for limitations on dividends resulting from the issuance of junior subordinated debentures 
additionally  the federal reserve board has authority to limit the payment of dividends by bank holding companies  such as the company  in certain circumstances  requiring  among other things  a holding company to consult with the federal reserve board prior to payment of a dividend if the company does not have sufficient recent earnings in excess of the proposed dividend 
the principal source of funds from which the company may pay dividends is the receipt of dividends from the bank 
the availability of dividends from the bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
the bank is subject first to corporate restrictions on its ability to pay dividends 
further  the bank may not pay a dividend if it would be undercapitalized after the dividend payment is made 
the payment of cash dividends by the bank is subject to restrictions set forth in the california financial code the financial code 
the financial code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its shareholders in excess of the lesser of a bank s retained earnings  or b bank s net income for its last three fiscal years  less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority owned subsidiary of the bank to the shareholders of the bank during such period 
however  a bank may  with the approval of the dfi  make a distribution to its shareholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of a its retained earnings  b its net income for its last fiscal year  or c its net income for its current fiscal year 
in the event that the dfi determines that the shareholders equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound  the dfi may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution 

table of contents the fdic may also restrict the payment of dividends if such payment would be deemed unsafe or unsound or if after the payment of such dividends  the bank would be included in one of the undercapitalized categories for capital adequacy purposes pursuant to federal law 
see  item description of business supervision and regulation 
while the federal reserve board has no general restriction with respect to the payment of cash dividends by an adequately capitalized bank to its parent holding company  the federal reserve board might  under certain circumstances  place restrictions on the ability of a particular bank to pay dividends based upon peer group averages and the performance and maturity of the particular bank  or object to management fees to be paid by a subsidiary bank to its holding company on the basis that such fees cannot be supported by the value of the services rendered or are not the result of an arm s length transaction 
however  under the mou issued by the fdic and dfi in april  the bank may not pay cash dividends or make other payments to the company without prior written consent of the fdic and dfi 
additionally  under the mou entered into with the federal reserve bank of san francisco in july  the company may not receive any dividends or other forms of payment from the bank or pay dividends to its shareholders without the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of san francisco and the director of the division of banking supervision and regulation of the board of governors of the federal reserve system

overview financial highlights net income for the twelve months ended december   was million  or per diluted share as compared with million  or per common share for the twelve months ended december  and a net loss of million  or per common share  for the twelve months ended december  the significant factors impacting the company s net income for the twelve months ended december  were a net benefit for income taxes in due the reversal of our remaining million of deferred tax valuation allowance as compared to a partial reversal of million in  a million improvement in non interest income  which totaled million in largely due to increases in the gains realized on the sale of mortgages  investment securities and other real estate owned oreo  a million improvement in non interest expense  which totaled million in  largely due to decreases in regulatory assessment costs  occupancy costs and data processing costs  partially offset by increases in outside service costs  provisions associated with the potential repurchase of mortgages sold and increased salary and benefit costs 
these improvements in operating results were partially offset by continued pressure on net interest income  due to the historically low interest rate environment in which we operate  and an increase in the provision for loan losses primarily attributable to specific reserve requirements related to a few large loans placed on non accrual in the first half of critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
accounting policies management considers to be significant  including newly issued standards to be adopted in future periods  are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies  of the consolidated financial statements filed in this form k 
the following discussions should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of real estate acquired through foreclosure  the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets and estimates used in the determination of the fair value of certain financial instruments 

table of contents allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed real estate in connection with the determination of the specific credit component of the allowance for loan losses for non performing loans in the loan portfolio and the value of foreclosed real estate  management obtains independent appraisals at least once a year for significant properties 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on non performing loans and foreclosed real estate  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in local economic conditions or other factors outside our control 
the general portfolio component of the allowance is determined by pooling performing loans by collateral type and purpose 
these loans are then further segmented by an internal loan grading system that classifies loans as pass  special mention  substandard and doubtful 
estimated loss rates are then applied to each segment according to loan grade to determine the amount of the general portfolio allocation 
estimated loss rates are determined through an analysis of historical loss rates for each segment of the loan portfolio  based on the company s prior experience with such loans 
in addition  qualitatively determined adjustments are made to the historical loss history to give effect to certain internal and external factors that may have either a positive or negative impact on the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio 
because of all the variables that go into the determination of both the specific and general allocation components of the allowance for loan losses  as well as the valuation of foreclosed real estate  it is reasonably possible that the allowance for loan losses and foreclosed real estate values may change in future periods and those changes could be material and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see also note allowance for loan losses  of the consolidated financial statements filed in this form k 
realizability of deferred tax assets the company uses an estimate of its future earnings in determining if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of its deferred tax assets will be realized over the period they are expected to reverse 
if based on all available evidence  the company believes that a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established 
during  the company established a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets 
based on the company s ongoing assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets  management reduced the level of the valuation allowance in and ultimately reversed the remaining valuation allowance during  based upon management s determination that it was more likely than not that the entire balance of the deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized

fair value of financial instruments the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of observable pricing and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no observable pricing and a higher degree of judgment is utilized in measuring the fair value of such instruments 
observable pricing is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and the characteristics specific to the transaction

results of operations net interest income and margin net interest income  the primary component of the net earnings of a financial institution  refers to the difference between the interest earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the net interest margin is the amount of net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
factors considered in the analysis of net interest income are the composition and volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the amount of non interest bearing liabilities  non accruing loans  and changes in market interest rates 

table of contents the table below sets forth average balance sheet information  interest income and expense  average yields and rates and net interest income and margin for the years ended december   and the average balance of non accruing loans has been included in loan totals

net interest margin has been calculated by dividing the net interest income by total average earning assets 

table of contents the volume and rate variances table below sets forth the dollar difference in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for each of the years ended december  and and the amount of such change attributable to changes in average balances volume or changes in average yields and rates for the year ended  for the year ended  december  december  dollar amounts in thousands volume rate rate volume total volume rate rate volume total interest income investments with other banks interest bearing due from investment securities taxable investment securities non taxable taxable equivalent adjustment other investments loans net increase decrease interest expense savings  now  money market time deposits other borrowings federal home loan bank borrowing long term borrowings net decrease increase total net increase decrease adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis using a tax rate of discussion of compared to for the years ended december  and  net interest income was million and million  respectively  and net interest margin was and  respectively 
during increased competition  coupled with the impact of a slow economy and low interest rate environment  had an adverse impact on yields on new and renewing loans 
in addition  the low interest rate environment had a two fold impact on securities yields as new investments are typically providing lower yields and existing investments in mortgage backed securities experienced increased levels of refinancing of the underlying mortgages  which results in acceleration of the amortization of premiums paid on these securities 
all of these factors combined to reduce the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  by basis points 
the mix of average earning assets for the year ended december  also contributed to the decline in the yield on earning assets  as a larger percentage of earning assets was invested in lower yielding securities as opposed to higher yielding loans 
however  the loan portfolio grew late in the second half of  which contributed to a more favorable earning asset mix 
this growth helped mitigate some of the downward pressures on net interest margin 
the declines in the yield on earning assets was partially offset by improvements in the cost of funds that were largely due to shifts in the composition of deposits from interest bearing accounts to more liquid and fully insured non interest bearing deposit accounts  coupled with reductions in the rates of interest paid on interest bearing deposits 
forgone interest on non accrual loans continued to adversely impact interest income for the year ended december  total forgone interest related to non accrual loans  which includes the initial accrued interest reversal when a loan is transferred to non accrual status  interest lost prospectively for the period of time a loan is on non accrual status and lost interest due to restructuring terms below original note terms or below current market rate terms  was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our earnings are directly influenced by changes in interest rates 
the nature of our balance sheet can be summarily described as consisting of short duration assets and liabilities and slightly net asset sensitive  meaning that changes in interest rates have a slightly more immediate impact on asset yields than they do on liability rates 
a large percentage of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities re price immediately with changes in the prime rate and other capital markets interest rates 
declines in interest rates have resulted in a significant portion of the loan portfolio reaching floor rates 

table of contents however  modifications in the loan floor rates over the last twelve months  primarily as part of loan renewals  have further contributed to the decline in current yields on our loan portfolio but have effectively reduced the level of upward interest rate movement required to see future improvement in yields on impacted loans 
see item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk  included in this form k for further discussion of the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements based on our current net asset sensitive profile  as well as the impacts of interest rate floors on the variable rate component of our loan portfolio 
for the year ended december   average interest earning assets were million  or  higher than that reported for the year ended december  the company s average investment in its securities portfolio increased by million in  as compared to increases in the relative percentage of the securities portfolio during as compared to higher yielding loans negatively impacted net interest margin 
the decline in the yield on interest earning assets for the year ended december  can be attributed to three key factors declines in the average returns on the loan portfolio due to continued downward rate pressure on new loans and renewals  the change of the mix of interest earning assets away from higher yielding loans to lower yielding investment securities  discussed above  and declines in the yields on the investment securities purchased over the last year due to continued market pressures on interest rates 
the adverse impacts of the shift in interest earning assets and declines in investment security and loan yields during were partially offset by the declines in the level of interest reversals and forgone interest on non accruing loans and lost interest due to troubled debt restructuring tdr rate concessions 
for the year ended december   the yield on the loan portfolio declined basis points to from the year ended december  this decline was largely attributable to declines in interest rates on new loans issued and loans renewed  which were driven by increased competition in the company s primary market area and the historically low interest rates set by the government to improve the economic recovery 
in addition  interest income for included million of interest recoveries on the pay off of non accrual loans  as well as prepayment penalties and related accelerations of unearned fees on loan payoffs  which represented million more than was realized in this decline in prepayment income in represented basis point of the decline in yield in as compared to these downward pressures on loan yields were partially offset by a decline in the level of forgone interest on non accrual loans from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total forgone interest on non accrual loans reduced the yield on the loan portfolio by basis points for the year ended december   as compared to basis points for the year ended december  beginning in and continuing through the first quarter of  new loan originations slowed due in part to a decline in loan demand and in part due to the impact of tighter underwriting standards resulting in fewer loans that met our underwriting criteria in the current economic environment 
as a result  in an effort to maximize the yield on interest earning assets in the absence of significant new loan originations  we invested excess liquidity primarily in agency mortgage backed securities and municipal securities 
these purchases account for the majority of the year over year increase in the average balance of the investment portfolio and the decline in the overall yield of taxable investment securities as these recently acquired investment securities currently yield considerably less than other investments in the portfolio 
these relatively short term investments have allowed the company to maximize yields on excess liquidity  while ensuring adequate cash flow to support potential loan growth in future periods 
beginning in the second quarter of  we began to experience renewed loan demand and growth in our loan portfolio 
assuming this loan growth continues over the next several quarters  we expect to realize an improved mix in earning assets which should help to stabilize our net interest margin 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities was million higher for the year ended december   than that reported for the year ended december  the year to date increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities can be attributed to million increase in federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings as the company chose to draw down additional long term advances in to lock in historically low  long term fixed rate funds 
this increase in borrowings was partially offset by declines in interest bearing deposits  most notably time deposits 
we attribute the decrease in time deposits in part to the migration to other interest bearing account categories  such as savings  and non interest bearing deposits as customers weighed their investment alternatives in the current low interest rate environment and were reluctant to commit funds to time deposits given low market yields 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined by basis points  to for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  these declines are in part due to the historically low interest rate environment that has existed for the last few years  but are also due to our efforts to systematically lower our cost of deposits over this same time period 
although such efforts have contributed to a moderate decline in time deposits  the overall deposit mix and cost of our deposit portfolio has improved as a result of these factors 

table of contents while we have experienced a decline in average interest bearing deposits during as compared with  our average non interest bearing demand deposit balances have increased on a comparative basis by million to million during this increase in non interest bearing demand balances has served to reduce our total funding cost by basis points for the year ended december   as compared to the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
management believes that the increase in non interest bearing demand deposits is indicative of money being held in highly liquid accounts pending the customer s determination of how best to invest the funds in light of today s low returns on traditional investments  and to a lesser degree the impact of unlimited deposit insurance coverage on non interest bearing demand accounts  which expired at the end as such  it is difficult to determine how long the increased levels of non interest bearing demand deposits will remain at or near the current levels and therefore how long we will benefit from this low cost source of funds 
our total cost of funds for the year ended december   was  a decrease of basis points as compared to for the year ended december   the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was as compared to for the year ended december  the year over year decline can be attributed in large part to the deposit portfolio rate reductions previously discussed 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in funding costs for the federal home loan bank borrowings due to a strategy designed to lock in historically low fixed rates on longer term borrowings as compared to the company s traditional reliance on a heavier mix of lower cost  variable rate short term borrowings 
discussion of compared to at december   average earning assets were approximately million  or  lower than that reported at december  this decline was driven by a million reduction in the level of net loans outstanding  due in large part to tepid loan demand together with the impact of million of loan sales completed in including the impacts of the million of loans transferred to held for sale status at december  and subsequently sold in january  and million decline in interest bearing funds due from banks  both of which were partially offset by an increase in investment securities  which increased by million over the decline in the overall average earning assets and the change in mix between loans and investment securities were the primary factors contributing to the decline in interest income and yield in  as higher yielding loans that were sold or paid down in  were replaced by lower yielding investment securities 
yields on the loan portfolio in were essentially flat compared to  as the impacts of originating and renewing loans in the low interest rate environment  which placed some level of downward pressure on rates  were substantially offset by a reduction in the level of non performing loans 
total forgone interest on impaired loans was approximately million for  impacting the yield on earning assets by approximately basis points  a decline of million and basis points from at december   average interest bearing liabilities decreased million as compared to december  the decline was largely caused by a reduction in the level of fhlb borrowings  which declined million and time deposits  which declined million 
time deposits and fhlb borrowings tend to be the higher cost elements of our interest bearing liabilities  therefore the decline in such balances led to a significant decline in the amount of interest expense and the cost associated with our interest bearing liabilities 
interest expense declined million from to million in and the average interest rate paid declined basis points to as a result of the interplay of the above factors  we realized an increase in both net interest income and net interest margin in as compared to provision for loan losses as more fully discussed in note allowance for loan losses  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k  the allowance for loan losses has been established for probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for probable incurred losses and is based on methodologies applied on a consistent basis with the prior year 
management s review of the adequacy of the allowance includes  among other things  an analysis of past loan loss experience and management s evaluation of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will likely vary from current estimates and these variances could be material and have an adverse effect on the company s performance 
the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan  the value of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for loan losses represents the company s best estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
for additional information see the allowance for loan losses discussion in the financial condition section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
discussion of compared to the company s provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of million as compared to the amount reported in in  the company migrated to a more granular loan risk grading scale after completing a risk grade recertification and full review of all loan relationships equal to or greater than thousand  which represented of gross loans at the time the review was performed 
while this review was primarily focused on ensuring existing loans were properly graded based on the new methodology  it provided additional insights on the overall credit quality of this portion of the portfolio 
the increase in the provision for loan losses is primarily attributable to increased reserve requirements associated with specific reserve calculations and related charge offs for a few large loans in the first half of the incremental provision requirements for these increases in specific reserves during were partially offset by reduced provision requirements on the majority of the remaining loan portfolio due to continued improvement in our historical loss data as older higher loss level periods roll out of the loss history window and are replaced by more recent losses at lower loss rates  and improvements in the qualitative portfolio factors which resulted from improvements in both the national and local economic indicators 
both of these factors form the principal basis for the general reserve portion of the allowance for loan losses 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans 
for additional information see the allowance for loan losses discussion in the financial condition section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
discussion of compared to the company s provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million as compared to that reported in the decrease in the provisions for loan losses can be attributed to a deceleration in the amount of required provisions due to efforts taken to identify and address potential credit issues  a decrease in the amount of classified and non performing loans through structured problem loan sales executed in and the overall improving quality of the loan portfolio  as evidenced by the improvements in the loss history over the last year  enhanced procedures around the issuance of new credit over the preceding couple of years  and early signs that the local economies  in which we operate  may be stabilizing after a prolonged period of recession and stagnant recovery  based on reports on improved unemployment levels and modest upward trends in commercial real estate leasing activity

table of contents discussion of compared to non interest income increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared with the amount reported for the primary drivers for the increases were increases in mortgage gain on sale and origination fees  improvements in the gain loss on sale of oreo and improved gains on sale of investment securities 
the increase in the mortgage related income was driven by investments we have made over the past year in the infrastructure and staffing levels of our mortgage banking business  which when combined with the current favorable interest rate environment led to increased refinancing and new home purchase loan activity and correspondingly to increased mortgage gain on sale and fee income as compared to the prior year 
while the immediate pipeline for potential mortgages to be funded remains substantially consistent with the volume of mortgages funded over the last couple of quarters  without further declines in mortgage rates it is unclear as to how long the current refinance volumes will continue to be experienced 
further  while we would not expect modest increases in mortgage rates to materially impact near term mortgage volumes  a large upward move in rates could have an adverse impact on the refinance market  the effects of which we believe could be partially mitigated by purchase mortgage originations increasing as buyers have historically tended to accelerate purchase decisions in the face of a rising rate environment 
the improvements in the gain loss on sale of oreo is attributable to a more stable real estate market  the reduced level of oreo holdings in and reduced risk of loss in value due to the passage of time  as average oreo assets turned over more quickly in than in the increase in gain on sale of investment securities was primarily driven by the narrowing of credit spreads  which improved the fair market value of the securities portfolio during which translated into greater gain on sale of such securities 
specifically  during  the company sold million of securities that resulted in gains of million  compared with million of securities sold in that resulted in gains of million 
much of the gain realized on the sale of investment securities in was in conjunction with management repositioning elements of the investment portfolio in an attempt to reduce the impacts of accelerating prepayment speeds on certain mortgage back securities and to eliminate the investment in corporate debt securities 
we will continue to monitor the investment portfolio and will take actions from time to time to reposition the portfolio to mitigate risk related to a changing interest rate environment as well as reducing exposure to volatility in yields due to changes in prepayment speeds 
discussion of compared to the decrease in non interest income in as compared to was largely due to the million one time gain recognized on the extinguishment of million of subordinated debt in  as the company reduced this higher cost debt in an effort to improve overall net interest income  as noted above 
see also note borrowings  of the consolidated financial statements  filed in this form k for additional discussion concerning the extinguishment of these borrowings 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in gains and fees attributable to mortgage sales  reflecting lower demand for new and refinance mortgages over most of the year 
although the volume of mortgages funded in was lower than  with the decline in mortgage rates in the second half of  which fell to new historical levels  and incremental staff being added to the mortgage team  mortgage funding levels increased in the second half of as compared to the first half of the year 
lastly  we experienced an increase in the level of loss on the sale of oreo  as we dramatically reduced the level of foreclosed assets through the sales of such properties  as part of our strategy to reduce non earning assets in partially offsetting these declines in non interest income was a million increase in gains on sales of investment securities  as the investment portfolio in whole returned to a net unrealized gain position and securities were sold  as part of our strategy to change the overall mix of the portfolio in an effort to improve the total return on invested funds  yielded higher gains

the size of the oreo portfolio diminished during both and  as the company entered into and closed several oreo sales over the last two years 
regulatory assessment costs for  regulatory assessment costs decreased approximately million compared with amounts reported for the year over year decrease within this category can be attributed in large part to realizing a full year s benefit in related to the fdic s new insurance assessment model that went into effect in the second quarter of  resulting in reduced deposit insurance premiums  as well as reductions triggered by the lifting of our consent order early in the second quarter of data processing for  data processing costs decreased approximately million compared with amounts reported in this decrease was primarily driven by having increased levels of one time fees related to new vendors and new services being implemented in that did not recur in occupancy for  occupancy costs decreased approximately million 
this decline is largely due to reductions in facility rental costs attributable to the repurchase of three branch buildings and our administrative office building in the first quarter of and the completion of the consolidation of three branch offices into nearby locations in the latter half of the second quarter of the savings in rental costs were only partially offset by increased depreciation costs associated with owning the buildings as opposed to leasing them 
the net savings resulting from buying the buildings back and the branch consolidation totaled million for year ended december  these savings were partially offset by provisions for lease terminations associated with the three branch closures 

table of contents the declines in the non interest expense categories described above for were partially offset by increases in the provision for potential mortgage repurchases  outside service provider expense and salaries and employee benefits 
the provision for potential mortgage repurchases increased by million 
this increase was largely driven by estimated losses primarily related to claims received in the second and fourth quarters of repurchase requests are relatively rare for the bank 
in fact  the total cash paid in settlement for mortgage repurchases has been less than million in the prior years 
our internal review has identified that the recent repurchase claims relate to loans made to related borrowers over five years ago 
we do not believe the requests are in any way indicative of systemic problems with the bank s underwriting or origination process or that there is significant exposure to repurchase requests other than those arising from the loans to the borrowers in question  which totaled million inclusive of the mortgage repurchases provided for in in addition  our outside service provider expense increased by million in as compared with largely due to our filing of registration statements related to our series a preferred stock and related warrants and our series c preferred stock and consulting services related to identifying operating efficiencies within the bank 
although there have been some benefits already realized from the operating efficiency studies  the majority of the identified savings are not expected to begin to be realized until the first half of salaries and employee benefits increased by million compared with  largely due to increased commissions due to higher mortgage loan originations and the re establishment in of an employee incentive compensation plan 
discussion of compared to total non interest expense decreased by approximately million in as compared with  primarily driven by decreases in salaries and employee benefits  write downs of foreclosed assets and regulatory assessment costs 
the million reduction in salaries and employee benefits was largely due to reduced commission expense due to a decline in mortgage origination volume and changes in related compensation plans in  reductions in accrual for compensated absences  and reductions in other benefit plan costs as part of cost reduction efforts resulting from working with benefit plan providers 
the decrease in write downs of foreclosed assets of million in was due to the fact that much of the write down on oreo inventory that existed at december  occurred in in  most of the oreo inventory was liquidated in conjunction with the company s strategy to reduce non performing assets  which when combined with reduced foreclosure activity during  resulted in a decline in the level of valuation allowance provisioning in the decrease in regulatory assessment costs of million in was largely due to a revision to the fdic deposit insurance assessment calculation that went into effect during provision for income taxes for the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million

financial condition the company saw continued improvement in its overall financial condition in at december   total assets were approximately billion

table of contents over the last several years  investor and consumer confidence in the us financial system was negatively effected 
as a result  many financial institutions in severe need of liquidity were forced to de leverage their balance sheets for a variety of reasons  selling significant portions of their investment holdings  which in turn placed considerable pressure on the values of many classes of investment securities 
in particular  mortgage related securities came under substantial pressure and the company s portfolio was not immune to this 
although substantially all of the company s mortgage related securities are considered investment grade  overall lack of confidence in the housing market and the inability of many consumers to meet their mortgage related obligations have  among other things  been influential in placing pressure on the prices of certain of these types of securities 
the majority of the company s mortgage securities were issued by the government national mortgage association ginnie mae  the federal national mortgage association fannie mae  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac 
these securities carry the full faith and guarantee of the issuing agencies and the us federal government 
at december   approximately million or of the company s mortgage related securities were issued by government agencies and government sponsored entities  such as those listed above

loans summary of market conditions despite the recent signs of stabilization in the local economies in which the company operates  loan demand remained tepid for much of and into the first quarter of however  with the addition of our new relationship managers who are focused on our region s largest industry  agriculture  as well as the commercial and small business segments of the market and expanded efforts by our mortgage lending team  the bank was able to generate net loan growth in the second through fourth quarters of and for the full year ended december  
table of contents we continue to see the early signs of borrower activity  which contributed to improved loan growth 
in addition our hiring of a new sales team and our expansion into ventura county with the opening of new loan production offices in oxnard in the middle of and goleta in the first quarter of  may contribute to continued growth in our loan portfolio for the foreseeable future 
although the company believes that it may be starting to see some signs of stabilization in the local economies in which it operates  the company realizes that a renewed decline in the global  national  state and local economies may further impact local borrowers  as well as the values of real estate within our market footprint used to secure certain loans 
as such  management continues to closely monitor credit trends and leading indicators for renewed signs of deterioration 
the bank employs more stringent lending standards and remains very selective with regard to loan originations  including commercial real estate  real estate construction  land and commercial loans that it chooses to originate  in an effort to effectively manage risk in this difficult credit environment 
the company is focused on monitoring credit in order to take appropriate steps when and if necessary to mitigate any adverse impacts on the company 
credit quality the company s primary business is the extension of credit to individuals and businesses and safekeeping of customers deposits 
the company s policies concerning the extension of credit require risk analyses including an extensive evaluation of the purpose for the loan request and the borrower s ability and willingness to repay the bank as agreed 
the company also considers other factors when evaluating whether or not to extend new credit to a potential borrower 
these factors include the current level of diversification in the loan portfolio and the impact that funding a new loan will have on that diversification  legal lending limit constraints and any regulatory limitations concerning the extension of certain types of credit 
the credit quality of the loan portfolio is impacted by numerous factors including the economic environment in the markets in which the company operates  which can have a direct impact on the value of real estate securing collateral dependent loans 
weak economic conditions in recent years have also impacted certain borrowers the company has extended credit to  making it difficult for those borrowers to continue to make timely repayment on their loans 
an inability of certain borrowers to continue to perform under the original terms of their respective loan agreements in conjunction with declines in real estate collateral values may result in increases in provisions for loan losses that have an adverse impact on the company s operating results

settlement from the correspondents is typically within to days of funding the mortgage 
at december   mortgage correspondent loans loans held for sale totaled approximately million  million more than that reported at december  the increase in mortgage correspondent loans in continues to reflect historically low mortgage rates and increases in sales staffing in the mortgage department  both of which has resulted in an increased volume of mortgages written and subsequently sold

these new residential to family loans have terms of years  during which rates are fixed for the first five years and then are variable for the remaining term of the mortgage

in addition  pay downs and payoffs exceeded new advances and the funding of new loans during across several components of the c i segment 
as a result of these factors  the ratio of total c i loan balances  including undisbursed commitments to risk based capital  declined from at december  to at december  the company s credit exposure within the c i segment remains diverse with respect to the industries to which credit has been extended

the allowance is comprised of two components specific loan reserves and general reserves  which includes a qualitatively determined amount 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to earnings and decreased by loan charge offs  net of recoveries of previously charged off balances

tract multi family hospitality commercial total construction land installment loans to individuals all other loans including overdrafts total allowance for loan losses allocation of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses as of december  decreased million from million at december   largely due to a decline in the general reserve requirements driven by improvements in the credit quality of the loan portfolio as evidenced by reductions in charge offs incurred over the look back period utilized in the historical loss portion of our model  as well as reductions in the qualitative factor related to local economic conditions due to stabilization and improvement in market conditions as described earlier in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation under loans summary of market conditions 
these improvements were partially offset by increased specific allowances and related charge offs recorded in the first half of associated with a few large loans that were placed on non accrual 
the allowance for loan losses decreased in by million  due to improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio  which resulted from management s efforts in to reduce classified loans  including non performing loans  through loan sales and the work out of credit matters with borrowers 
the decline in the allowance also reflects improvements in the level of special mention risk graded loans in  due to the improvement in the credit quality of several large borrowers and the workout of credit issues on other loans 
during  the company also experienced some stabilization in both general economic conditions and real estate valuations  and a reduced level of new transfers of loans to non performing status  which when combined with the sale of non performing loans resulted in a decline in the overall allowance for loan losses as compared to  which period reflected the highest level of allowance in the company s history 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to the commercial real estate segment of the portfolio declined by million from million at december  to million at december  this decline was driven primarily by an improvement in the loss history and improvements in the qualitative factors  which were largely the result of improvements in both the national and local economic indicators  both of which form the basis for our general allowance for the commercial real estate segment 

table of contents the decline was also impacted by charge downs of loans associated with updated specific reserve calculations during the second quarter of this decline was favorably impacted by an improvement in the level of special mention and substandard loans in the commercial real estate segment  which fell by from million at december  to million at december  the c i segment of the loan portfolio was the other segment that experienced a major decline in its allocation in the allowance for loan losses 
this allowance for loan loss allocation declined by million  from million at december  to million at december  this decline was driven primarily by the previously discussed reclassification of a million credit relationship and related specific reserves to land during  the single largest cause of the improvement in the level of special mention and substandard loans in the c i segment  which fell by from million at december  to million at december  the decline in the c i portion of the portfolio allowance for loan losses was also driven by continued improvements in the historical loss history during  which factors into the determination of the general reserve component of the allowance for loan losses 
these improvements in the components of the allowance for loan losses were largely offset by a million increase in the allocation of reserves to land  largely associated with the previously mentioned transfer of a million c i credit and the related specific reserves to land due to a restructuring of the customer s total credit relationship with the bank during although we have experienced some stabilization in general economic conditions and real estate values over the last two years  should the local market experience renewed deterioration in economic conditions or the credit quality of the segments mentioned above it may result in additional significant provisions for loan losses and increases in the allocation of the allowance to those categories 
at december   the balance of classified loans was approximately million 
this compares to the million in classified loan balances reported at december  the decline in the level of classified loans reflects continued improvement in the overall credit quality of the portfolio through a combination of pay downs and up grades of substandard credits  along with charge offs  exceeding the level of inflow into the classified pool 
although the improvement in classified assets has had a direct impact on the level of calculated general portfolio allocation under the company s methodology for determining an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses  other factors  such as the lingering effects of elevated historical charge off levels  and continued concerns over the speed and level of recovery of the local economy and real estate values require us to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level higher than that experienced for most of the bank s year history 
net loan charge offs for the year ended december  totaled approximately million compared to approximately million for the decrease in charge offs is largely due to charge offs being elevated due to the sale of certain non performing loans 
these sales accounted for million of the net charge offs in absent the effects of the loan sale related charge offs  charge off levels would be elevated on a comparative basis  driven largely by the partial charge offs associated with the previously discussed updated specific reserve calculations as well as million of charge offs being attributable to a single credit relationship for which the borrower is under investigation of fraud 
net loan charge offs during decreased million from million reported in the decrease in net charge offs in as compared to the prior year was due in large part to elevated charge off levels in the second and third quarters of  when we recorded charge offs equal to of our current basis in several loans in our portfolio 
these charge offs were recorded due to the prolonged deterioration in the borrowers ability to repay and the lack of viable collateral to continue to justify any level of recoverability against these loans 
annualized net charge offs to average loans for the year ended december  were  the lowest level of net charge offs the company has experienced since  as compared to for at december   the allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans compared to the reported at december  as of december   management believes the allowance for loan losses was sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio

while we do not expect to see a material overall reduction in the level of deposits as a result of this change in the level of deposit insurance  we could experience a change in mix of our deposits away from non interest bearing accounts and into interest bearing accounts  which could negatively impact our cost of funds 
the company continues to focus on gathering and retaining core relationships  which has helped to reduce the overall cost of funding for each of the last two years

these calculations are referred to as the leverage ratio and two risk based calculations known as tier one risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio 
these standards were developed through joint efforts of banking authorities from different countries around the world 
the standards are based on the premise that different types of assets have different levels of risk associated with them and take into consideration the off balance sheet exposures of banks when assessing capital adequacy 
the company and the bank seek to maintain strong levels of capital in order to be considered well capitalized as determined by regulatory agencies by an amount commensurate with our risk profile 
the company s potential sources of capital include retained earnings and the issuance of equity 
although the company and the bank rely primarily on earnings from the bank s operations to generate capital  the absence of earnings in and required the company to obtain additional capital through the issuance of preferred and common equity in at december   the company had million in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures the debt securities issued and outstanding 
these securities were issued to heritage oaks capital trust ii 
at december   the company included million of the net junior subordinated debt in its tier i capital for regulatory reporting purposes 
for a more detailed discussion regarding these debt securities  see note borrowings  of the consolidated financial statements  filed with this report on form k 

table of contents the general minimum regulatory capital ratios are as set forth in the table below 
however  on february   the bank stipulated to the issuance of an order that was issued march   by the fdic and dfi  which required higher levels of tier i leverage and total risk based ratios 
under the order the bank was required to maintain a tier i leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as a result of the termination of the order in april and the board of directors execution of a memorandum of understanding with the fdic and dfi  the bank will no longer be subject to the total risk based capital requirement of but has agreed to continue to adhere to the tier leverage ratio 
subsequent to the termination of the order  the bank should be considered well capitalized as long as it maintains this minimum leverage ratio

table of contents there are no special purpose entity spe trusts  corporations  or other legal entities established by the company which reside off balance sheet 
there are no other off balance sheet items other than the aforementioned items related to letter of credit accommodations and un disbursed loan commitments 
management is not aware of any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to meet the demands of depositors  investors and borrowers 
asset liquidity is primarily derived from loan payments and payments and maturities from other earning assets 
liquidity from liabilities is obtained primarily from the receipt of new deposits 
the bank s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the on and off balance sheet commitments to meet the cash needs of customers while maintaining sufficient liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the bank to meet expected and unexpected obligations in both stable and adverse conditions 
alco meets regularly to assess projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual customer funding needs 
deposits generated from the bank s customers serve as the primary source of liquidity 
the bank has credit arrangements with correspondent banks that serve as a secondary liquidity source 
at december   these credit lines totaled million 
these two lines are unsecured 
at december   the bank had no borrowings against these lines 
the bank is a member of the fhlb and has collateralized borrowing capacities remaining of million at december  additionally  the bank also has a borrowing facility with the federal reserve 
the amount of available credit is determined by the collateral provided by the bank 
as of december   the borrowing availability related to this facility was million 
the bank also manages liquidity by maintaining an investment portfolio of readily marketable and liquid securities 
these investments include mortgage backed securities and obligations of state and political subdivisions municipal bonds that provide a steady stream of cash flows 
as of december   the company believes investments in the portfolio can be pledged or liquidated at their current fair values in the event they are needed to provide liquidity 
the ratio of liquid assets not pledged for collateral and other purposes to deposits and other liabilities was at december  compared to at december  the ratio of gross loans to deposits  another key liquidity ratio  declined to at december  compared to at december  management believes the level of liquid assets and available credit facilities are sufficient to meet current and anticipated funding needs 
in addition  the bank s asset liability management committee oversees the company s liquidity position by reviewing a monthly liquidity report 
management is not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result or are reasonably likely to result in a material change in the company s liquidity 
capital expenditures as of december   the company was not subject to any material commitments for capital expenditures  other than the million purchase of a building in cambria  california 
this acquisition was completed in early and the bank intends to relocate its cambria branch operations to the new building from its current leased location in the second half of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of interest income and interest expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
virtually all of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the bank level 

table of contents thus  virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level other than million in subordinated debentures issued by the company s subsidiary grantor trust 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk procedures are performed at the bank level 
in addition to risk related to interest rate changes  the bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within santa barbara and san luis obispo counties  california  is subject to risks of changes in the underlying value of collateral as a result of changes in the local economy 
the fundamental objective of the company s management of its assets and liabilities is to maximize the company s economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets re price differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
the company seeks to control interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
management believes historically it has effectively managed the effect of changes in interest rates on its operating results and believes that it can continue to manage the short term effects of interest rate changes under various interest rate scenarios 
management employs asset and liability management software that is used to measure the company s exposure to future changes in interest rates 
this model measures the expected cash flows and re pricing of each financial asset liability separately in measuring the company s interest rate sensitivity 
based on the results of the software s output  management believes the company s balance sheet is evenly matched over the short term and slightly asset sensitive over the longer term as of december  this means that the company would expect all other things being equal to experience a limited change in its net interest income if rates rise or fall 
the level of potential or expected contraction indicated by the tables below is considered acceptable by management and is compliant with the company s asset liabilities committee policies 
the hypothetical impacts of sudden interest rate movements applied to the company s asset and liability balances are modeled quarterly 
the results of these models indicate how much of the company s net interest income is at risk from various rate changes over a one year horizon 
the general improvement in the potential impacts of changing interest rates in reflects the impact of loan renewals over the last year  in which the company reduced the floor rates in response to the continued soft interest rate environment 
while this has had a negative impact on current yields it has reduced the potentially adverse impacts of future rate changes as compared to those seen in this exercise is valuable in identifying risk exposures 
management believes the results for the company s december  balances indicate that the net interest income at risk over a one year time horizon for a basis points bp and bp rate increase and a bp decrease is acceptable to management and within policy guidelines at this time 
given the low interest rate environment  a bp decrease is not considered a realistic possibility and is therefore not modeled 
the results in the table below indicate the change in net interest income the company would expect to see as of december  and  if interest rates were to change in the amounts set forth rate shock scenarios december  dollar amounts in thousands bp base bp bp net interest income change from base change from base rate shock scenarios december  dollar amounts in thousands bp base bp bp net interest income change from base change from base 
table of contents it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may differ materially and adversely from the information reported above 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management  and actual results may turn out to be different  and the forecast and assumptions may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitor behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior and management s responses 
factors that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the company s net interest income  therefore  the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
the following table shows management s estimates of how the loan portfolio is segregated between variable and fixed rate loans  and estimates of re pricing opportunities for the entire loan portfolio at december  and dollars amounts in thousands as of december  as of december  percent of percent of rate type balance total balance total variable daily variable other than daily fixed rate total gross loans as of december   the table above indicates that approximately of the loan portfolio that will re price immediately in a changing rate environment 
at december   approximately million or of the company s loan portfolio is considered variable 
the following table shows the repricing categories of the company s loan portfolio at december  and dollar amounts in thousands as of december  as of december  percent of percent of re pricing balance total balance total year years years years total gross loans the following table provides a summary of the loans the company can expect to see adjust above floor rates based on given movements in the prime rate as of december  and move in prime rate bps december  dollar amounts in thousands variable daily variable other than daily cumulative total variable at floor move in prime rate bps december  dollar amounts in thousands variable daily variable other than daily cumulative total variable at floor given the significant decline in prime rate over the last two years  many loans in the portfolio possess floors significantly higher than the current prime rate 
as indicated in the table above  the company will need to see rates increase by to basis points before the majority of variable rate loans in the portfolio start to come off their floors thereby ending their fixed rate interest rate risk profile and returning them to a fully variable interest rate risk profile 
when such occurs  holding all other interest rate risk variables constant  the company will become more net asset sensitive 
during the last several years  the company moved to protect net interest margin by implementing floors on new loan originations 
management believes this strategy proved successful in insulating net interest margin in the declining interest rate environment experienced over the last several years 
however in a rising rate environment  management believes that these loan floors will result in compression of net interest margin and potentially a decline in net interest income 
until such time as rates increase above the floors  increases in interest rates may have a greater impact on our overall cost of funds  which could result in a reduction in net interest income and net interest margin  as previously reflected in the rate shock table in this item a
