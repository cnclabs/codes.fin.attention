discontinued operations two of our prior businesses the storage products business unit  which was previously reported in the commercial fixturing components segment and the prime foam products business unit  which was previously reported in the residential furnishing segment are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since i the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been eliminated from our ongoing operations  ii the businesses have been disposed of  and iii we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses 
we divested the storage products business unit in the third quarter of no significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit 
storage products is reflected as a discontinued operation with revenue of approximately million 
this unit sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and health care industries 
during the second quarter of  we received a cash litigation settlement of million related to our former prime foam products unit  which was sold in march this business unit produced foam primarily used for cushioning by upholstered furniture and bedding manufacturers

risk factors 
investing in our securities involves risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 
we have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products which may negatively impact our sales  operating cash flow and earnings 
as a supplier of products to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products 
market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence 
to a lesser extent  market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors  including disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  energy costs and interest rates 
all of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and drive demand for our products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders  sales and earnings in our businesses 
several factors  including a weak global economy  a depressed housing market  or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world 
short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends 
many consumers continue to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture 
if economic and market conditions deteriorate  we may experience material negative impacts on our business  financial condition  operating cash flows and results of operations 
costs of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings 
raw material cost increases and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases can significantly impact our earnings 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  therefore  our raw material costs move with the market 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time can negatively impact our earnings 
conversely  if raw material costs decrease  we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers 
reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our segment margins and earnings 
steel is our principal raw material 
the global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years 
this volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year 
our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap 
we experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years 
as a producer of steel rod  we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod 
if scrap costs raise more rapidly than the price of steel rod  the metal margins within our rod producing operation will be compressed 
compressed metal margins could negatively impact our result of operations 
higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components 
this primarily impacted our residential furnishings and industrial materials product mix and decreased profit margins 
this trend could further negatively impact our results of operations 

table of contents part i competition could adversely affect our market share  sales  profit margins and earnings 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
we believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price  but  depending upon the particular product  we experience competition based on quality  performance and availability as well 
we face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia and europe 
in addition to lower labor rates  foreign competitors benefit at times from lower raw material costs 
they may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates 
if we are unable to purchase key raw materials  such as steel  at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers  our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors 
premium non innerspring mattresses those that have either a foam or air core have experienced rapid growth in the us bedding market in recent years 
while still a relatively small portion of the total market in units approximately  these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars approximately due to their higher average selling prices 
if sales of foam or air core mattresses continue to grow appreciably  it could reduce our market share in the us bedding market  and negatively impact our sales and earnings 
our goodwill and other long lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long lived assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately billion  or approximately of our total assets 
in addition  net property  plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled approximately million  or approximately of total assets 
we review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in june as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing  and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists 
in addition  we test for the recoverability of long lived assets at year end  and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
the annual goodwill impairment review performed in june indicated no goodwill impairments  but fair market value for one of our ten reporting units store fixtures only exceeded book value by approximately 
the fair market values of all other reporting units exceeded book value by more than 
the goodwill associated with the store fixtures reporting unit was million at december  the unit is dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores 
although recent performance has met expectations  the predictability of future results is less certain than that of our other reporting units due to the project nature of this business 
if we are not able to maintain current performance levels  future impairments could be possible 
if actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long lived asset calculations  we could incur impairment charges  which could negatively impact our earnings 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness  profit margins and earnings 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales  which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in  of our sales were generated by international operations 
the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  however  certain of our operations experience currency related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
further  our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results 

table of contents part i technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we rely on information systems to obtain  process  analyze and manage data  as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities 
we receive  process and ship orders  manage the billing of  and collections from  our customers  and manage the accounting for  and payment to  our vendors 
security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
if this occurs  our operations could be disrupted  or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information 
we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities or new discoveries in the field of cryptography will not compromise our technology protecting information systems 
if these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time  then our results of operations could be adversely affected 
new conflict minerals regulations may adversely affect the sourcing  availability and pricing of conflict minerals or components which contain conflict minerals  and may result in loss of sales  additional expenses and reduced profitability 
on august   as mandated by the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the sec adopted new disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and their derivatives  namely tin  tantalum  tungsten or gold  known as conflict minerals  if these minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of the company products 
these regulations require such issuers to report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals 
the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing  availability and pricing of conflict minerals used in the manufacture of certain electronic components  including those assembled into our products 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements  including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products 
since our supply chain is complex  the due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are drc conflict free  which may harm our reputation 
we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as drc conflict free  which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of sales 
these new requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals  and we may be unable to obtain conflict free minerals at competitive prices  which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability 
deteriorating financial condition of our customers could negatively affect our sales  earnings  cash flows and liquidity 
we serve customers in a variety of industries  some of which have and are continuing to experience low levels of demand 
a sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that one or more of our significant customers  or a group of less significant customers  could become insolvent  which could adversely impact our sales  earnings  cash flow and liquidity 
we may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
economic uncertainty or tax law changes could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets

table of contents part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
highlights demand continued to improve in several of our markets during sales grew in automotive  us spring  adjustable bed  geo components  carpet underlay  and parts of our home furniture components business 
growth in unit volumes was partially offset by lower trade sales at our steel mill and changes in currency rates 
higher unit volumes led to improved earnings and record earnings per share from continuing operations 
earnings also benefited from cost improvements and the western pneumatic tube acquisition 
in january we purchased western pneumatic tube  a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems 
this was our first significant acquisition since  and established for us a strong competitive position in a higher return  higher growth market 
operating cash for the full year increased significantly on stronger earnings and improvements in working capital levels 
we again generated more than enough cash from operations to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures  something we ve accomplished for over years 
marked the st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company  with a compound annual growth rate of over that time period 
only two other s p companies can claim as high a rate of dividend growth for as many years 
our financial profile remains strong 
we ended with net debt to net capital slightly below the conservative end of our long term targeted range 
in august we issued million of year senior notes and used the proceeds to pay down commercial paper 
we ended the year with the entire million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility 
we assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return tsr to that of peer companies on a rolling three year basis 
we target tsr in the top one third of the s p over the long term 
for the three years ended december   we generated tsr of per year on average 
that places us in the top of the s p  just shy of our top one third goal 
these topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 

table of contents part ii introduction total shareholder return total shareholder return tsr  relative to peer companies  is the key financial measure that we use to assess long term performance 
tsr is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay 
tsr change in stock price dividends beginning stock price 
we seek to achieve tsr in the top one third of the s p over the long term through a balanced approach that employs all four tsr sources revenue growth  margin expansion  dividends  and share repurchases 
we monitor our tsr performance relative to the s p on a rolling three year basis 
for the three year measurement period that ended december   we generated tsr of per year on average  compared to for the s p index 
that places us in the top of the s p  just shy of our top one third goal 
our incentive programs reward improved return on investment 
senior executives participate in a tsr based incentive program based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of approximately peers 
business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit s direct control 
customers we serve a broad suite of customers  with our largest customer representing approximately of our sales 
many are companies whose names are widely recognized  they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding  a variety of other manufacturers  and many major retailers 
major factors that impact our business many factors impact our business  but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand  raw material cost trends  and competition 
market demand market demand including product mix is impacted by several economic factors  with consumer confidence being most significant 
other important factors include disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  and interest rates 
all these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore affect demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
demand improved in several of our markets during as expected  we realized significant earnings leverage as unit volumes grew  and this led to improved margins 
over the last few years we have significantly reduced our fixed cost structure  but purposely retained spare production capacity 
accordingly  unit sales can increase appreciably without the need for large capital investment 
we have meaningful operating leverage that should further benefit earnings as market demand continues to improve 
with our current utilization levels  we should be able to readily accommodate over billion in revenue assuming current sales mix 
until our spare capacity is fully utilized  each additional million of sales from incremental unit volume is expected to generate approximately million to million of additional pre tax earnings 

table of contents part ii raw material costs in many of our businesses  we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials 
this purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have 
still  our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials many of which are commodities fluctuate 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  accordingly  our raw material costs generally move with the market 
our ability to recover higher costs through selling price increases is crucial 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
conversely  when costs decrease significantly  we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers 
the timing of our price increases or decreases is important  we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs  so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline 
steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity 
in most cases  the major changes both increases and decreases were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments 
in late  steel costs began increasing  and we raised our selling prices in early to recover the majority of the higher costs 
by mid year  market prices for certain types of steel had begun to decrease 
the margin pressure we experienced in the last half of resulted in part from lowering our selling prices selectively in advance of our average cost of steel declining  in order to maintain market share and minimize deterioration in product mix 
the alignment of costs and pricing improved in during the year  we experienced month to month variability in steel costs  but overall for  costs decreased slightly 
as a producer of steel rod  we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod 
steel scrap costs and metal margins were relatively stable for the majority of as mentioned above  in we experienced month to month variability in steel scrap costs and steel rod pricing  however for the full year  metal margins were comparable to our other raw materials include woven and non woven fabrics  foam scrap  and chemicals 
we have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years  and in most years  have been able to pass them through to our customers 
when we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs  this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components 
we experienced this de contenting effect in our residential furnishings segment in the back half of however selective selling price reductions helped contain this activity 
as our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address commodity inflation  our profit margins were negatively impacted 
we must continue to find ways to assist our customers in improving the functionality and reducing the cost of their products  while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations 
competition many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line 
in general  our competitors tend to be smaller  private companies 
many of our competitors  both domestic and foreign  compete primarily on the basis of price 
our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive  while delivering better product quality  innovation  and customer service 

table of contents part ii we continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore 
in addition to lower labor rates  foreign competitors benefit at times from lower raw material costs 
they may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates 
we typically remain price competitive  even versus many foreign manufacturers  as a result of our highly efficient operations  low labor content  vertical integration in steel and wire  and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities 
however  we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices  and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
the margin pressure we experienced in the last half of resulted in part from price competition in certain of our businesses as we reduced prices selectively to maintain market share in light of depressed industry volume 
premium non innerspring mattresses those that have either a foam or air core have experienced rapid growth in the us bedding market in recent years 
while still a relatively small portion of the total market in units approximately  these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars approximately due to their higher average selling prices 
we expect these products to continue to grow 
some of our traditional bedding customers are now offering mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel 
these hybrid products  which allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring  are being well received by consumers 
we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from china  south africa and vietnam which was brought to a favorable conclusion in early the current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant  ranging from to  and should remain in effect at least until early imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices  however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin 
in  leggett  along with several us manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping countervailing duty orders  formed a coalition and are working with members of congress  the us department of commerce  and us customs and border protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and or countervailing duty orders 
restructuring plan in december  we approved a restructuring plan to reduce our overhead costs and improve ongoing profitability 
the activities primarily entailed the closure of four underperforming facilities 
we incurred a million pre tax largely non cash charge in the th quarter of primarily related to this plan  which included million of long lived asset impairments and million of other restructuring related costs 
during  we incurred an additional million of restructuring related costs and million of long lived asset impairments related to this plan 
these activities were substantially complete by the end of and no significant additional costs related to the plan are expected 

table of contents part ii results of operations vs 
demand improved in many of our markets during growth in unit volumes was partially offset by lower trade sales at our steel mill sales shifted from trade to intra segment and changes in currency rates 
earnings increased significantly  from million in to million in this improvement reflects several factors  including lower restructuring related costs  higher unit volumes  benefits from special tax items  cost improvements  and earnings from the western pneumatic tube acquisition 
further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below 
consolidated results the following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during  and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes 
dollar amounts in millions  except per share data amount net sales year ended december  same location sales increase lower steel mill trade sales and currency approximate unit volume increase same location sales increase acquisition sales growth divestitures year ended december  net earnings attributable to leggett platt dollar amounts  net of tax year ended december  non recurrence of restructuring related costs from december non recurrence of building gains special net tax benefits higher effective tax rate higher interest expense other factors  including higher unit volumes  cost improvements  and acquisition earnings year ended december  earnings per share earnings per share improved demand in several of our markets led to higher sales in same location sales increased  with unit volume growth partially offset by a revenue decline from lower trade sales at our steel mill and changes in currency rates 
unit volumes grew during the year in automotive  us spring  adjustable bed  geo components  carpet underlay  and certain parts of our home furniture components business 
the decrease in trade sales of steel rod during was largely offset by an increase in intra segment rod sales  so total rod production for the year was roughly flat with 
table of contents part ii earnings increased significantly in due to several factors 
operationally  these included higher unit volumes  cost improvements  and earnings from the western pneumatic tube acquisition 
the other items detailed in the table above also collectively contributed to the earnings increase 
in  earnings were reduced by restructuring related costs primarily associated with the december plan discussed on page in  earnings benefited from special tax items  which included the elimination of a valuation allowance on canadian deferred tax assets 
lifo impact all of our segments use the first in  first out fifo method for valuing inventory 
in our consolidated financials  an adjustment is made at the corporate level ie outside the segments to convert about of our inventories to the last in  first out lifo method 
these are primarily our domestic  steel related inventories 
moderate inflation resulted in lifo expense of million in in  lower commodity costs led to a lifo benefit of million 
for further discussion of inventories  see note a to the consolidated financial statements on page interest and income taxes net interest expense in was million higher than in  primarily due to the issuance in august of million of long term notes 
the effective income tax rate of on continuing operations was lower than the incurred in the tax rate benefited from the fourth quarter release of a million valuation allowance on certain canadian deferred tax assets primarily tax loss carryforwards 
as a result of an increase in operating earnings in canada  the amalgamation of two canadian subsidiaries  and the restructuring of intercompany debt attributable in part to a change in canadian tax law  we now expect those carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to be utilized in future years 
the tax rate also benefited from the second quarter recording of a million deferred tax asset for the tax basis of a subsidiary which is likely to be realized in these benefits were partially offset by the fourth quarter accrual of million of withholding taxes on earnings in china  which was required since we no longer have specific plans to reinvest all these earnings within china 
we also experienced other  less significant  discrete tax items both favorable and unfavorable that substantially offset for the year 
excluding the net impact of all these items  our effective tax rate would have been approximately 
we expect an ongoing cash flow benefit of million to million per year for the next to years as the canadian tax loss carryforwards are utilized 
the tax rate benefited from changes in our mix of earnings among taxing jurisdictions  one time tax planning strategies  and the settlement of our through irs examination 
as a result of the tax planning strategies and tax audit  we recognized tax benefits of million in on january   president obama signed the american taxpayer relief act of  which retroactively extended certain corporate tax provisions 
although several of these provisions will benefit our tax rate  we do not expect a material impact as a result of this legislation 

table of contents part ii segment results in the following section we discuss sales and earnings before interest and taxes ebit for each of our segments 
we provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment ebit to consolidated ebit in note f to the consolidated financial statements on page dollar amounts in millions change in sales change same location sales sales residential furnishings commercial fixturing components industrial materials specialized products total intersegment sales elimination external sales change in ebit ebit margins ebit residential furnishings commercial fixturing components industrial materials specialized products intersegment eliminations other change in lifo reserve total this is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures 
these are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier 
segment margins are calculated on total sales 
overall company margin is calculated on external sales 
residential furnishings residential furnishings sales increased in  entirely from higher unit volumes 
demand improved in several of our residential markets during the year 
in our us spring business  innerspring unit volumes increased  in large part from growth of comfort core  which is our pocketed coil product offering 
strong market reception of hybrid mattresses is helping to drive growth in this category 
we again had significant growth in adjustable beds  with unit volumes up in sales also grew in geo components  carpet underlay  seating components  and sofa sleepers 
these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in furniture hardware unit volumes and declines in our international spring business 
ebit and ebit margins increased in  primarily due to higher sales and the absence of the december restructuring related costs of million 

table of contents part ii commercial fixturing components sales in commercial fixturing components decreased in  due to the divestiture of our uk based point of purchase display operation in january apart from the divestiture  sales in the segment were flat with volumes in the store fixtures business were roughly flat for the year  with significantly lower spending by certain retailers offset by large programs in the third quarter associated with a major customer re branding initiative 
sales in our office furniture components business were also essentially unchanged  which we believe was consistent with demand trends in the office seating market 
ebit and ebit margins increased in  primarily benefiting from prior cost improvement initiatives and the absence of the december restructuring related costs of million 
industrial materials sales in the segment increased in  with revenue from acquisitions partially offset by lower trade sales from our steel mill 
the decrease in trade sales of steel rod during was largely offset by an increase in intra segment rod sales  so total rod production for the year was roughly flat with the rod mill continues to operate at full capacity 
despite the negative sales comparisons they create  lower trade sales of rod are generally neutral to earnings if production levels are stable and we re consuming the rod in our own wire mills 
ebit and ebit margins increased versus  primarily due to the absence of the december restructuring related costs of million  cost improvements  and earnings from acquisitions 
ebit margins also increased during the year as a result of the change in sales from trade to intra segment at our steel rod mill 
this sales shift is beneficial to margins since it decreases our reported sales while preserving comparable ebit levels 
segment sales and ebit benefited from the acquisition in january of western pneumatic tube 
that business  which resides in the industrial materials segment  exceeded our initial first year forecast  and as expected  generated ebit margins greater than the company average 
specialized products in specialized products  sales increased in  with growth in automotive partially offset by changes in currency exchange rates 
sales also increased slightly in commercial vehicle products  but machinery volumes were down versus the prior year 
our automotive business continued to experience strong growth during in north america and asia  but sales declined in europe from currency impacts and ongoing economic weakness 
ebit and ebit margins increased in primarily from higher sales and the absence of the december restructuring related costs of million 
results from discontinued operations full year earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax  was not material in either year or 

table of contents part ii results of operations vs 
sales growth in was driven primarily by factors that bring little incremental earnings 
the main revenue catalyst was raw material related price inflation  but currency and a change in sales at our steel mill from intra segment to trade also contributed to the year over year increase 
across the remainder of the company as a whole  unit volume was up slightly 
full year earnings decreased  from million in to million in primarily from higher restructuring related costs 
further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below

unit volumes grew primarily due to a shift in the mix of sales at our steel mill from intra segment to trade 
across the bulk of our businesses  in aggregate  market demand increased slightly 

table of contents part ii demand improved in certain of our markets during  with automotive and office furniture leading the way 
in contrast  stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets 
many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness 
earnings decreased in  largely due to restructuring related costs associated with the decision in the fourth quarter to close certain manufacturing facilities 
other factors  including slightly higher unit volume  a lower effective tax rate  and higher selling  administrative  and other costs essentially offset during the year 
lifo impact all of our segments use the first in  first out fifo method for valuing inventory 
in our consolidated financials  an adjustment is made at the corporate level ie outside the segments to convert about of our inventories to the last in  first out lifo method 
these are primarily our domestic  steel related inventories 
in both and  moderate inflation led to full year lifo expense million in and million in 
for further discussion of inventories  see note a to the consolidated financial statements on page interest and income taxes net interest expense in was roughly flat with the consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate of was lower than the incurred in several factors contributed to the reduction  including changes in our mix of earnings among taxing jurisdictions  one time benefits from tax planning strategies  and tentative agreement reached with the irs regarding the examination of our through tax years 
as a result of the tax planning strategies and audit  we recognized tax benefits of million in this was comparable to a tax benefit realized in related to the irs examination in that year of certain tax credit claims  which was substantially offset by incremental taxes from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings in that year 
we also experienced other less significant  discrete tax items both favorable and unfavorable that substantially offset for the year 

table of contents part ii segment results in the following section we discuss sales and ebit for each of our segments 
we provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment ebit to consolidated ebit in note f to the consolidated financial statements on page dollar amounts in millions change in sales change same location sales sales residential furnishings commercial fixturing components industrial materials specialized products total intersegment sales elimination external sales change in ebit ebit margins ebit residential furnishings commercial fixturing components industrial materials specialized products intersegment eliminations other change in lifo reserve total this is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures

segment margins are calculated on total sales 
overall company margin is calculated on external sales 
residential furnishings residential furnishings sales increased in  primarily from inflation and currency  which generated little profit 
unit volume in the segment was flat 
demand in most of our residential markets continued to be soft as consumers postponed spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture 
full year unit volumes were essentially flat in our us spring business but declined in international spring and furniture hardware from pronounced market weakness mid year 
the only business in the segment that posted meaningful unit growth in was our adjustable bed business  where unit volumes grew for the full year 
ebit and ebit margins decreased versus  primarily due to higher restructuring related costs of million  less favorable sales mix  inflation  and other operating cost increases 
we initiated restructuring activities in the last half of in an effort to improve ongoing profitability  and part of that activity occurred in residential furnishings 
we consolidated four operations in the segment  including two carpet underlay plants  a canadian spring facility  and a fabric coating business 

table of contents part ii commercial fixturing components sales decreased in  largely from lower demand in our store fixtures business  as some of the large  value oriented retailers significantly curtailed both new store construction and remodeling activity during the year 
in contrast  market demand continued to improve in office furniture components as that business posted strong growth in ebit and ebit margins in the segment decreased versus  primarily due to lower sales in the store fixtures business 
our efforts to improve ongoing profitability resulted in the decision late in to consolidate one of our six remaining store fixture locations 
industrial materials sales increased  reflecting steel related price inflation and higher trade sales from our steel mill  both of which generated little incremental profit 
full year unit volumes declined in both wire drawing and steel tubing  reflecting weak bedding  furniture  and store fixtures end markets 
ebit and ebit margins decreased versus  mainly from higher restructuring related costs of million 
ebit margins also decreased during as a result of a change in sales from intra segment to trade at our steel rod mill 
this sales shift is dilutive to margins since it results in a higher level of reported sales without increasing the level of reported ebit 
reported earnings are roughly comparable despite whether rod is sold to our wire mills intra segment or to trade customers 
restructuring activities in late involved the closure of two facilities in the segment 
we closed one of our six domestic wire drawing operations and consolidated that volume into two of the remaining plants 
we also announced the closing of a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire dishwasher racks into the domestic appliance industry 
specialized products in specialized products  sales increased in  primarily reflecting improved demand across the major businesses in the segment 
changes in currency exchange rates also added to year over year sales growth 
automotive growth continued to benefit from the recovery in global industry production 
ebit increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales partially offset by higher restructuring related costs of million  raw material cost inflation  and currency impacts 
ebit margins were flat 
results from discontinued operations full year earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax  was not material in either year or 

table of contents part ii liquidity and capitalization our operations provide most of the cash we require 
debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs 
in  cash from operations increased significantly from higher earnings and improvements in working capital levels 
for over years  our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments 
we expect this once again to be the case in we ended with net debt to net capital at  slightly below the conservative end of our long term targeted range of  and consistent with year end levels 
the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital is presented on page in august  we issued million of year notes 
with the proceeds  we reduced our use of commercial paper and ended the year with our entire million commercial paper program and revolving credit agreement fully available 
uses of cash finance capital requirements cash is readily available to fund growth  both internally through capital expenditures and externally through acquisitions 

capitalexpenditures

acquisitions 
jpg 
capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain  modernize  and expand manufacturing capacity 
as shown in the chart above  capital expenditures have been stable in recent years 
in all of our businesses  we invest to maintain facilities and equipment 
we also invest to support new product introductions and specific product categories that are rapidly growing 
however  with excess productive capacity across our operations from continued low demand levels  we have had relatively low spending on expansion projects 
we expect capital expenditures of less than million in the expected increase versus primarily relates to new programs that we have been awarded  and that should contribute to earnings and cash flow beginning in 
table of contents part ii our strategic  long term  annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions 
we are seeking acquisitions within our growth businesses  and are looking for opportunities to enter new  higher growth markets carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage 
during through  acquisitions were a lower priority as we primarily focused on improving margins and returns of our existing businesses 
as a result  no significant acquisitions were completed in or in  we again turned our focus to acquisitions and began actively soliciting opportunities while maintaining our screening discipline 
in january  we purchased western pneumatic tube for million 
this acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure  leading positions in growing  profitable  attractive markets 
western established for us a strong competitive position in the higher return  higher growth aerospace market 
additional details about acquisitions can be found in note r to the consolidated financial statements on page pay dividends

dividendrate 
jpg 
dividends are the primary means by which we return cash to shareholders 
during  we declared four quarterly dividends  but paid five  given our decision to accelerate into december the dividend typically paid in january of million in anticipation of individual tax rate increases 
the chart above reflects that accelerated dividend payment 
in  we expect to return to our typical dividend schedule and pay the fourth quarter dividend in  therefore the cash requirement for dividends in will be lower  at approximately million 
maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority 
in  we increased the quarterly dividend to 
per share and extended to years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases  at an average compound growth rate of 
our targeted dividend payout is approximately of net earnings 
actual payout has been higher in recent years  but as earnings continue to grow  we expect to move into that target range 

table of contents part ii repurchase stock 
stockpurchases 
jpg 
stock repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders 
during the past three years  we repurchased a total of million shares of our stock and issued million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans  reducing outstanding shares by 
given the million cash outlay to acquire western pneumatic tube early in the year  our share repurchases in were below those of recent years 
during  we repurchased million shares at an average of and issued million shares at an average of 
two thirds of the issuances related to employee stock option exercises  which increased notably in with the significant share price appreciation during the year 
consistent with our stated priorities  we expect to use remaining operating cash after funding capital expenditures  dividends  and acquisitions to prudently buy back our stock  subject to the outlook for the economy  our level of cash generation  and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company 
we have been authorized by the board to repurchase up to million shares each year  but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable 
cash from operations cash from operations is our primary source of funds 
earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations 

cashfromoperationsjpg 

table of contents part ii cash from operations increased  to million during  on stronger earnings and improvements in working capital levels largely from reductions in accounts receivable 
in  cash from operations decreased primarily due to lower earnings 
we continue to closely monitor our working capital levels  and ended the year with adjusted working capital at of annualized sales  notably better than our target 
the table below shows this calculation 
we eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our operating efficiency and believe this provides a more useful measurement 
dollar amounts in millions current assets current liabilities working capital cash and cash equivalents current debt maturities adjusted working capital annualized sales adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales annualized sales equal th quarter sales million in and million in multiplied by we believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful  since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume 
the increase in adjusted working capital relates primarily to the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter dividend million 
the following table presents dollar amounts related to key working capital components at the end of the past two years 
amount in millions change trade receivables  net inventory  net accounts payable trade receivables decreased from year end levels  primarily due to lower trade sales late in the year in certain businesses and improved credit terms with certain customers 
inventory increased from year end  primarily due to i acquisitions  ii decisions to take advantage of temporarily lower commodity costs near the end of in certain businesses  and iii higher production in late for programs that ship in early accounts payable also increased primarily due to the opportunistic purchases of raw materials and higher production in late  both of which also impacted inventory levels 

table of contents part ii the next chart shows recent trends in key working capital components expressed in numbers of days at the end of the past five quarters 
working capital trends 
workingcapitaltrends 
jpg 
the trade receivables ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as ending net trade receivables quarterly net sales number of days in the quarter 
the inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as ending net inventory quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter 
the accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as ending accounts payable quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter 
changes in the quarterly days sales outstanding dso reflect normal seasonal fluctuations due to the timing of cash collection and other factors 
the decrease in the fourth quarter dso was driven by improved payment patterns with several large customers  and some customers taking advantage of cash discounts and other incentives for early payment 
in  we incurred million of customer bad debt expense as compared to million in  which is largely a reflection of a modest improvement in the financial stability of customers in the majority of our markets 
we expect dso in to follow our normal seasonal pattern 
our days inventory on hand dio increased compared to the prior year primarily due to decisions to take advantage of temporarily lower commodity costs near the end of in certain businesses and higher production in late for programs that ship in early we do not expect that either of these situations will increase our exposure to obsolete and slow moving inventory 
during both and  we recognized expense of million associated with obsolete and slow moving inventories 
we actively strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors  and over the last few years  have increased our days payable outstanding dpo by more than ten days 
we expect that we will be able to continue this favorable trend going forward 

table of contents part ii working capital levels vary by segment 
the commercial fixturing components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the store fixtures group 
this business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time 
capitalization this table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt outstanding scheduled maturities average interest rates average maturities in years revolving credit commercial paper total long term debt deferred income taxes and other liabilities equity total capitalization unused committed credit long term short term total unused committed credit current maturities of long term debt cash and cash equivalents ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x these rates include current maturities  but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities 
the rates also include amortization of interest rate swaps 
fixed charges include interest expense  capitalized interest  plus implied interest included in operating leases 
earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes  plus fixed charges 

table of contents part ii the next table shows the percent of long term debt to total capitalization at december  and  calculated in two ways long term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table 
long term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long term debt 
we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly 
we use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net debt total capitalization current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net capitalization long term debt to total capitalization net debt to net capitalization total debt which includes long term debt and current debt maturities increased million in  in part from the million cash outlay to acquire western pneumatic tube 
in august  we issued million aggregate principal of notes that mature in unless redeemed earlier 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  with interest payable semi annually beginning on february  the net proceeds of the notes were used to pay down commercial paper  which in turn provided borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes  the repayment of existing indebtedness  the funding of possible future acquisitions  and stock repurchases 
as a part of the above issuance  we also unwound the million forward starting interest swaps we had entered into during and recognized a loss of approximately million  which will be amortized over the life of the notes 
this results in a fully weighted effective interest rate of associated with the notes 

table of contents part ii short term borrowings we can raise cash by issuing up to million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders 
this agreement was renewed in  with a five year term ending in the credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to million 
when we issue letters of credit in this manner  our capacity under the agreement  and consequently  our ability to issue commercial paper  is reduced by a corresponding amount 
amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were dollar amounts in millions total program authorized commercial paper outstanding classified as long term debt letters of credit issued under the credit agreement total program usage total program available the average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during was million and million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter  the average and maximum amounts outstanding were million and million respectively 
commercial paper amounts increased in january from the million cash outlay to acquire western pneumatic tube 
subsequently  borrowing levels fluctuated due to normal changes in working capital funding requirements 
as discussed on the prior page  we used the proceeds from the notes we issued in august to pay down commercial paper  and ended the year with the entire million program available 
at year end  we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement  but we had million of stand by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing 
on april   we have million of notes that mature 
with anticipated operating cash flows  our commercial paper program  and our expected ability to issue debt in the capital markets  we believe we have more than sufficient funds available to repay this maturing debt  as well as support our ongoing operations  pay dividends  fund future growth  and repurchase stock 
accessibility of cash at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million primarily invested in interest bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less 
a substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations 
though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs  we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the us over a period of two to three years without material cost 
however  if we had to bring all the foreign cash back immediately  we would incur incremental tax expense of up to million 
in we brought back million of cash  and in we brought back million  in each case at no added tax cost 

table of contents part ii contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollar amounts in millions long term debt capitalized leases operating leases purchase obligations interest payments deferred income taxes other obligations including acquisitions  pensions  and reserves for tax contingencies total contractual cash obligations the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due 
purchase obligations primarily include open short term days purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities 
interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at december  at rates in effect at the end of the year 

table of contents part ii critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to do so  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and disclosures 
if we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change  and some of those changes could be significant 
our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management  at the time they are made  to be reasonable and appropriate 
estimates are adjusted for actual events  as they occur 
critical accounting estimates are those that are a subject to uncertainty and change  and b of material impact to our financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements 
we provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in note a to the consolidated financial statements on page description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of june and as triggering events occur 
in the past three years  no impairments have been recorded as a result of the annual impairment reviews 
in order to assess goodwill for potential impairment  judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit which is one level below reportable segments using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit 
the cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance 
margins  sales growth  and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model 
fair market value for one of the reporting units store fixtures exceeded book value by approximately 
the goodwill associated with this reporting unit is million  and is dependent on capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores 
retailer activity was roughly flat in  and the store fixtures reporting unit met full year expectations 
however  due to the project nature of this business  the predictability of future results is less certain than that of other reporting units 
if we are not able to maintain current performance levels  future impairments could be possible 
the remaining reporting units have fair market values that exceed carrying value by more than  and have goodwill of million 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill cont 
the market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio 
ratios are derived from comparable publicly traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit 
information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in note c on page other long lived assets other long lived assets are tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for other long lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured usually at a branch level 
impairments of other long lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place  or we decide to discontinue product lines completely 
our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets 
for assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value  fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets 
these impairments are unpredictable 
impairments were million in  million in  and million in the impairments were largely the result of lowered future business expectations at several underperforming locations that resulted in the decision to exit some unprofitable lines of business 
prior forecasts assumed a recovery in business levels primarily housing related industries that had not materialized by late inventory reserves we reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow moving ie not selling very quickly 
at december   the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was million approximately of fifo inventories 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory reserves cont 
if we have had no sales of a given product for months  those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely 
if we have more than a one year s supply of a product  we value that inventory at net realizable value what we think we will recover 
changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving 
the calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience on average 
additions to inventory reserves in were million  which were comparable to the previous year 
we do not expect obsolescence to change from current levels 
workers compensation we are substantially self insured for costs related to workers compensation  and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation 
our estimates of self insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay since we are self insured 
we consider a number of factors  including historical claim experience  demographic factors  and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers 
over the past five years  we have incurred  on average  million annually for costs associated with workers compensation 
average year to year variation over the past five years has been approximately million 
at december   we had accrued million to cover future self insurance liabilities 
internal safety statistics and cost trends have improved in the last several years 
we expect worker compensation costs to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future 
credit losses for accounts and notes receivable  we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible 
when we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay  we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible 
our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  industry and macroeconomic considerations  and historical loss experience 
a significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates 
the average annual amount of customer related credit losses was million less than of annual net sales over the last three years 
at december   our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled million about of our accounts and customer related notes receivable of million 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions credit losses cont 
our customers are diverse and many are small to medium sized companies  with some being highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning 
in and  bad debt expense averaged million 
we have not experienced any significant individual customer bankruptcies in the past two years 
we believe the financial health of our major customers has modestly improved  but some are highly leveraged  and this could cause circumstances to change in the future 
at december   we had million of non customer notes receivable  primarily related to divested businesses  and have recorded reserves of million for these notes 
most of these notes are to be paid by highly leveraged entities  which could result in the need for additional reserves in the future 
pension accounting for our pension plans  we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and the current value of those benefit obligations 
the pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid  which also impacts current year pension expense 
determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held bonds and equities 
the discount rates used to calculate the pension liability for our most significant plans decreased approximately basis points in due to lower corporate bond yields 
each basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by 
million and increases the plans benefit obligation by million 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions pension accounting cont 
other assumptions include rates of compensation increases  withdrawal and mortality rates  and retirement ages 
these estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations 
the expected return on assets in decreased to  compared to in and in a basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by 
million  but have no effect on the plans funded status 
assuming a long term investment horizon  we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption 
income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions  even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time 
these estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements 
subsequent to year end  we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns 
tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions  including among other things the timing and amounts of deductions  and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain 
our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions 
our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws  the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction  and the results of current tax audits and assessments 
potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
in  we accrued million for taxes on earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested in china 
if all non repatriated earnings were taxed  we would incur additional taxes of approximately million 
tax audits by various taxing authorities are expected to increase as governments continue to look for ways to raise additional revenue 
based upon past experience  we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this increased audit activity  however  we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes cont 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount  source  and timing of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts we believe have no more than a probability of being realized 
in addition  assumptions have been made regarding the non repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries 
those assumptions may change in the future  thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation 
the recovery of net operating losses nol s has been closely evaluated for the likelihood of recovery based upon factors such as the age of losses  viable tax planning strategies  and future taxable earnings expectations 
we believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary 
however  if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required  we could incur additional tax expense 
we assessed our ability to recover canadian nol and other deferred tax assets  and determined that previously recorded valuation allowances were no longer necessary 
therefore  we recorded income of million in the fourth quarter of related to this reversal 
contingencies we evaluate various legal  environmental  and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate 
if it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred  we accrue a liability for the reasonable estimate of the ultimate loss 
our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies ie  losses that may or may not occur contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur  and our estimate of the likely cost

shareholder derivative lawsuit on august   a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the new england carpenters pension fund in the circuit court of jasper county  missouri as case no 
ao cc suit 
the suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff  in the same court  on february  suit 
the suit was dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff failure to make demand on our board and shareholders 
as before  the plaintiff did not make such demand 
on april   the suit was dismissed without prejudice 
on may   the plaintiff filed an appeal to the missouri court of appeals 
on november   the missouri court of appeals reversed the trial court dismissal  and remanded the case back to the trial court finding that plaintiff sufficiently pled demand on the board and shareholders 
we filed a request for transfer to the missouri supreme court on december   which was denied by the court of appeals 
on january   we filed a transfer petition to the missouri supreme court 
on february   the missouri supreme court denied our request 
the case will be sent back to jasper county  missouri for further proceedings 
the suit was purportedly brought on our behalf  naming us as a nominal defendant  and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including david s 
haffner  karl g 
glassman  matthew c 
flanigan  ernest c

the plaintiff alleged  among other things  that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties  backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans  caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements  sold our stock while possessing material non public information  committed gross mismanagement  wasted corporate assets  committed fraud  violated the missouri securities act  and were unjustly enriched 
the plaintiff is seeking  among other things unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants  certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct  the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals  the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds  punitive damages  the rescission of certain unexercised options  and the reimbursement of litigation costs 
the plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from us 
we have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions 
we and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit in late october  asserting the plaintiff failed to make demand on our board and shareholders as required by missouri law  and  consistent with the court ruling in the suit  this failure to make demand should not be excused  the dismissal of the suit precludes the suit  the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder  the suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed  the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim  the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity  and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the december  grant 
as to this grant  the motions to dismiss advised the court that it was made under our deferred compensation program  which i provided that options would be dated on the last business day of december  and ii was filed with the sec on december  setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date 
we do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating cash flows or results of operations

million  under pta case no 

l p brazil filed its response denying any violation on january  
table of contents part ii we deny all of the allegations in these actions 
we believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves 
however  these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties 
at this time  we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating cash flows or results of operations 
patent infringement claim on january   in a case in the united states district court for the central district of california  the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of million based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs 
this action was originally filed on october   as case number cv rgk ssx under the caption imaginal systematic  llc v 
leggett platt  incorporated  simmons bedding company  and does through  inclusive 
leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify simmons bedding company against a claim for infringement 
on summary judgment motions  we unsuccessfully disputed each patent validity and denied that we infringed any patent 
at the jury trial on damages issues  the plaintiff alleged damages of million 
the court denied plaintiff attempt to win an attorney fee award and triple the pre verdict damages 
on april  we appealed the case to the federal circuit court of appeals 
oral argument was held on february  before a three judge appeal panel in the federal circuit in washington dc on february   the court of appeals issued a judgment affirming the million verdict against us 
we intend to request a rehearing of the court of appeals decision 
if a rehearing is not granted  we have the right to request further review to the us supreme court 
however  this review is discretionary 
if the case is finally affirmed and remanded to the trial court  the plaintiff might also request royalties for post verdict use of the machines 
if so  we intend to object to such request 
we also filed reexamination proceedings in the patent office case nos 
 filed february    and  filed february   challenging the validity of each patent at issue 
the patent office examiner ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of one of the three patents 
the patent office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second patent  but subsequently reversed that decision 
with respect to the third patent  the patent office examiner decision upheld the validity of all claims 
all three of these proceedings are currently on appeal before the board of patent appeals 
due to a change made to all of the machines  we do not believe that the machines currently use the feature alleged to have infringed the third patent 
at this time  we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating cash flows or results of operations 
new accounting standards we adopted new accounting guidance in  as discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements on page  which did not have a material impact on our current financial statements
