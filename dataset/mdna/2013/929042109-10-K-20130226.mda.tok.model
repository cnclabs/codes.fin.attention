critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
as real estate is undergoing development activities  all property operating expenses directly associated with and attributable to  the development and construction of a project  including interest expense  are capitalized to the cost of real property to the extent we believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the property 
the capitalization period begins when development activities are underway and ends when the project is substantially complete 
general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and tenant relationships and acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors  including historical operating results  known trends and market economic conditions 
identified intangibles are recorded at their estimated fair value  separate and apart from goodwill 
identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  were billion and billion  respectively 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets including acquired above market leases  tenant relationships and acquired in place leases were  and  respectively  and the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities  a component of deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets  were  and  respectively 
our properties  including any related intangible assets  are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis 
an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
impairment analyses are based on our current plans  intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  anticipated holding periods  or market conditions change  our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses 
critical accounting policies continued partially owned entities we consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest 
in determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity  we consider factors such as ownership interest  board representation  management representation  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity vie and we are the primary beneficiary 
we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a vie when we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
when the requirements for consolidation are not met  we account for investments under the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity 
equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period 
investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method 
investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value 
impairment analyses are based on current plans  intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared 
the ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities  including toys r us  was billion and billion  respectively 
mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable we invest in mortgage and mezzanine loans of entities that have significant real estate assets 
these investments are either secured by the real property or by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate 
we record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium 
we accrete or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method or straight line method  if the result is not materially different 
we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable 
a loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or as a practical expedient  to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if our estimates of the collectability of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of mortgage and mezzanine loans receivable were  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies continued allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  and  as of december  and  respectively 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds 
these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved 
hotel revenue income arising from the operation of the hotel pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue  food and beverage revenue  and banquet revenue 
income is recognized when rooms are occupied 
food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered 
trade shows revenue income arising from the operation of trade shows  including rentals of booths 
this revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred 
expense reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
management  leasing and other fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities 
this revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
cleveland medical mart revenue arising from the development of the cleveland medical mart 
this revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements using the criteria set forth in asc  multiple element arrangements  as we are providing development  marketing  leasing  and other property management services 
before we recognize revenue  we assess  among other things  its collectibility 
if our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes  the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
income taxes we operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders
