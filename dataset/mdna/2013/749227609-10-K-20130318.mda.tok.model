item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations sponsored companies for further discussion of this strategy 
financing strategy investments in loans and debt securities our strategy involves using multiple sources of short term financing to acquire assets with the ultimate goal of financing these investments on a long term  match funded basis or selling these assets 
match funding enables us to match the interest rates and maturities of our assets with the interest rates and maturities of our financing  thereby reducing interest rate risk and funding risks in financing our portfolio on a long term basis 
we expect to use a variety of short term funding sources  including warehouse facilities  repurchase agreements  bank credit facilities and bank participations  until we obtain permanent long term financing or a buyer for these assets 
we currently use short term financing provided by two cmbs facilities to originate cmbs eligible loans prior to their ultimate sale to cmbs securitizations and by a bridge loan facility to originate bridge loans 
we have financed a majority of our commercial real estate loan portfolio through two non recourse loan securitizations  rait cre cdo i  ltd  or rait i  and rait preferred funding ii  ltd  or rait ii 
rait i and rait ii are among the five securitizations referenced above where we serve as collateral manager 
we are expanding our use of loan participation arrangements with other lenders whereby such lenders acquire an interest in a loan that we that we have originated 
these arrangements may provide equivalent  senior or subordinated interests as between us and the other lender in the loan 
we financed most of our debt securities portfolio in a series of non recourse debt securities securitizations which provided long term  interest only  match funded financing for the trups and subordinated debenture investments 
as of december   we retained a controlling interest in two securitizations  taberna preferred funding viii  ltd  or taberna viii  and taberna preferred funding ix  ltd  or taberna ix  which are consolidated entities 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securitization summary below 
we seek to use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our financing strategies particularly where the loans we make with the proceeds of financing we obtain are not match funded with the financing 
reits generally are able to enter into transactions to hedge indebtedness used to acquire real estate assets  provided that the total gross income from such hedges and other non qualifying sources does not exceed of the reit s total gross income 
investments in real estate we have financed our portfolio of investments in commercial real estate through secured mortgages held by either third party lenders or our commercial real estate securitizations 
upon conversion of commercial real estate loans to real estate investments  we generally keep the existing financing provided by rait i and rait ii 
our investment portfolio our consolidated investment portfolio is currently comprised of the following asset classes commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans  other loans and preferred equity interests 
we originate and own senior long term mortgage loans  including cmbs eligible loans  short term bridge loans  subordinated  or mezzanine  financing and preferred equity interests 
these assets are in most cases non recourse or limited recourse loans secured by commercial real estate assets or real estate entities 
this means that we look primarily to the assets securing the loan for repayment  subject to certain standard exceptions 
we originate loans that are eligible to be sold to securitizations issuing commercial mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  which we refer to as cmbs eligible loans 
we may from time to time acquire existing commercial real estate loans from third parties who have originated such loans  including banks  other institutional lenders or third party investors 
where possible  we seek to maintain direct lending relationships with borrowers  as opposed to investing in loans controlled by third party lenders

investment in debt securities trups and subordinated debentures 
historically  we provided reits and real estate operating companies the ability to raise subordinated debt capital through trups and subordinated debentures 
trups are long term instruments  with maturities ranging from to years  which are priced based on short term variable rates  such as the three month london inter bank offered rate  or libor 
trups are unsecured and generally contain minimal financial and operating covenants 
we financed most of our debt securities portfolio in a series of non recourse securitizations which provided long dated  interest only  match funded financing to the trups and subordinated debenture investments 
as of december   we retained a controlling interest in two such securitizations taberna viii and taberna ix  which are consolidated entities 
we present all of the collateral assets for the debt securities and the related non recourse securitization financing obligations at fair value in our consolidated financial statements 
during  due to the credit performance of the underlying collateral  we received only our senior collateral management fees from these two securitizations 
we do not expect to add investments in this asset category for the foreseeable future due to market conditions

investment in debt securities other real estate related debt securities 
we have invested  and expect to continue to invest  in cmbs  unsecured reit notes and other real estate related debt securities 
unsecured reit notes are publicly traded debentures issued by large public reporting reits and other real estate companies 
these debentures generally pay interest semi annually 
cmbs generally are multi class debt or pass through certificates issued by cmbs securitizations secured or backed by single loans or pools of mortgage loans on commercial real estate properties 
our cmbs investments may include loans and securities that are rated investment grade by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies  as well as both unrated and non investment grade loans and securities

we also conduct the operations of our subsidiary  taberna realty finance trust  or taberna  irt and any reits we may sponsor in the future  which we collectively refer to as our reit affiliates  to each qualify as a reit 
for a discussion of the tax implications of our and our reit affiliates reit status to us and our shareholders  see material us federal income tax considerations contained in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
to qualify as a reit  we and our reit affiliates must continually satisfy various tests regarding sources of income  nature and diversification of assets  amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of common shares 
in order to satisfy these tests  we and our reit affiliates may be required to forgo investments that might otherwise be made 
accordingly  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our or our reit affiliates investment performance 
these requirements include the following for each of ourselves and our reit affiliates  at least of total assets and of gross income must be derived from qualifying real estate assets  whether or not such assets would otherwise represent our or our reit affiliates best investment alternative 
for example  since neither trups nor investments in the debt or equity of securitizations are qualifying real estate assets  to the extent that we have historically invested in such assets  or may do so in the future  taberna and we  to the extent that we invest in such assets must hold substantial investments in qualifying real estate assets  including mortgage loans and cmbs  which may have lower yields than such investments 
also  at least of each of our and our reit affiliates gross income in each taxable year  excluding gross income from prohibited transactions  must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the gross income test described above  as well as other dividends  interest  and gain from the sale or disposition of shares or securities  which need not have any relation to real property 
a reit s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a penalty tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property  other than foreclosure property  but including any mortgage loans  held in inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the prohibited transaction tax may apply to any sale of assets to a securitization and to any sale of securitization securities  and therefore may limit our and our reit affiliates ability to sell assets to or equity in securitizations and other assets 
overall  no more than of the value of a reit s assets may consist of securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss 
our trss that currently hold assets include rait jupiter holdings  llc the holding company for our interest in jupiter communities  rait trs  llc the holding company for advisors of our sponsored companies and independence securities  taberna capital management  llc the collateral manager for taberna viii and taberna ix  or tcm  and rait funding llc the holding company for crp commercial services  the entities that issued our junior subordinated notes  the entities party to our cmbs facilities referred to below  taberna viii  taberna ix and their co issuers 
our and our reit affiliates ability to grow or expand the fee generating businesses held in a trss  as well as the business of future trss we or our reit affiliates may form  will be limited by our and our reit affiliates need to meet this test 
the reit provisions of the internal revenue code limit our and our reit affiliates ability to hedge mortgage backed securities  preferred securities and related borrowings 
except to the extent provided by the regulations promulgated by the us treasury department  or the treasury regulations  any income from a hedging transaction we or our reit affiliates enter into in the normal course of business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made  or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred  to acquire or carry real estate assets  which is clearly identified as specified in the treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired  originated  or entered into  including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction  will not constitute gross income for purposes of the gross income test and will generally constitute non qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
to the extent that we or our reit affiliates enter into other types of hedging transactions  the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests 
as a result  we or our reit affiliates might have to limit use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through trss 
this could increase the cost of our or our reit affiliates hedging activities or expose it or us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we or it would otherwise want to bear 
there are other risks arising out of our and our reit affiliates need to comply with reit requirements

investment company act limits we seek to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company 
under section a of the investment company act  a company is not deemed to be an investment company if it neither is  nor holds itself out as being  engaged primarily  nor proposes to engage primarily  in the business of investing  reinvesting or trading in securities  and it neither is engaged nor proposes to engage in the business of investing  reinvesting  owning  holding or trading in securities and does not own or propose to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding of the value of its total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis  which we refer to as the test 
investment securities excludes us government securities and securities of majority owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the investment company act relating to issuers whose securities are held by not more than persons or whose securities are held only by qualified purchasers  as defined 
we rely on the test because we are a holding company that conducts our businesses through wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries 
as a result  the securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the investment company act  together with any other investment securities we may own  may not have a combined value in excess of of the value of our total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis 
based on the relative value of our investment in taberna  on the one hand  and our investment in rait partnership  on the other hand  we can comply with the test only if rait partnership itself complies with the test or an exemption other than those provided by sections c or c 
because the principal exemptions that rait partnership relies upon to allow it to meet the test are those provided by sections c c or c relating to subsidiaries primarily engaged in specified real estate activities  we are limited in the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries 
none of rait  rait partnership or any of their subsidiaries has received a no action letter from the sec regarding whether it complies with the investment company act or how its investment or financing strategies fit within the exclusions from regulation under the investment company act that it is using 
to the extent that the sec provides more specific or different guidance regarding  for example  the treatment of assets as qualifying real estate assets or real estate related assets  we may be required to adjust these investment and financing strategies accordingly 
see item a risk factors other regulatory and legal risks of our business loss of our investment company act exemption would affect us adversely 
competition we are subject to significant competition in all aspects of our business 
existing industry participants and potential new entrants compete with us for the available supply of investments suitable for origination or acquisition  as well as for debt and equity capital 
with respect to our sponsored companies  we compete with other sponsors of offerings by commercial real estate businesses for access to debt and equity capital 
we compete with many third parties engaged in real estate finance and investment activities  including other reits  specialty finance companies  savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  mutual funds  institutional investors  investment banking firms  lenders  governmental bodies and other entities 
with respect to our investments in real estate  we face significant competition from other owners  operators and developers of properties  many of which own properties similar to ours in markets where we operate 
competition may increase  and other companies and funds with investment objectives similar to ours may be organized in the future 
some of these competitors have  or in the future may have  substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk 
they may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from  among other things  a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies 
in addition  competition may lead us to pay a greater portion of the origination fees that we expect to collect in our future origination activities to third party investment banks and brokers that introduce borrowers to us in order to continue to generate new business from these sources

item a 
risk factors this section describes material risks affecting our business 
risks related to our business the commercial real estate finance industry has been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the us and global financial markets generally 
our business and operations depend on the commercial real estate finance industry generally  which in turn depends upon broad economic conditions in the us and abroad 
despite some recent improvements  the us economy is continuing to experience relatively high unemployment and slow growth 
a worsening of economic conditions would likely have a negative impact on the commercial real estate finance industry generally and on our business and operations specifically 
additionally  disruptions in the global economy may also have a negative impact on the commercial real estate market domestically 
adverse conditions in the commercial real estate finance industry could harm our business and financial condition by  among other factors  reducing the value of our existing assets  limiting our access to debt and equity capital  limiting our ability to originate new commercial real estate debt and otherwise negatively impacting our operations 
liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on outside sources of capital that have been negatively impacted by us and global economic conditions 
we require significant outside capital to fund and grow our businesses 
a primary source of liquidity for us has been the equity and debt capital markets  including issuances of common equity  preferred equity  trust preferred securities and convertible senior notes 
access to the capital markets and other sources of liquidity was severely disrupted during the us recession that began in and  despite improvements since the end of the recession  the markets could suffer another severe downturn and another liquidity crisis could emerge 
if we fail to secure financing on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts our taxable income may be reduced by limiting our ability to originate loans and other investments  reducing our fee income and increasing our financing expense 
a reduction in our net taxable income could impair our liquidity and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders 
we cannot assure you that any  or sufficient  funding or capital will be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us 
for information about our available sources of funds  refer to part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to the consolidated financial statements located in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
the price of our common shares and other securities historically has been volatile 
this volatility may affect the price at which anyone holding our common shares or other securities could sell them  and the sale of substantial amounts of our common shares or such other securities could adversely affect the price of our common shares or such other securities 
the market price for our common shares has varied between a high of on march  and a low of on june  in the twelve month period ending on march  this volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the common shares 
other securities we have issued have also had volatile market prices 
the market prices of our securities are likely to continue to be volatile and the trading volume subject to significant fluctuations in response to market and other factors  including the other risk factors discussed in this report  variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates  and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments 
our reliance on debt to finance investments may require us to make balloon payments upon maturity  upon the exercise of any applicable put rights or otherwise  and an increased risk of loss  may reduce our return on investments  reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders and possibly result in the foreclosure of any assets subject to secured financing 
we have historically incurred a debt to finance our investments  which could compound losses and reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders 
our debt service payments could reduce the net income available for distributions to our shareholders and reduce our liquidity available to make distributions to our shareholders each calendar year required for reit qualification 
most of our assets are pledged as collateral for borrowings 
in addition  the assets of the securitizations that we consolidate collateralize the debt obligations of the securitizations and are not available to satisfy our other creditors 
to the extent that we fail to meet debt service obligations  we risk the loss of some or all of our respective assets to foreclosure or sale to satisfy these debt obligations 
currently  our declaration of trust and bylaws do not impose any limitations on the extent to which we may leverage our respective assets 
we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flows will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the risk that we will be unable to refinance our indebtedness when it becomes due  or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our indebtedness 
included in our debt instruments are provisions providing for the lump sum payment of significant amounts of principal  whether upon maturity  upon the exercise of any applicable put rights or otherwise  which we refer to as balloon payments 
most of our debt provides for balloon payments that are payable at maturity 
if collateral underlying any secured credit facility we are party to defaults or otherwise fails to meet specified conditions  we may have to repay that facility to the extent it was secured by that collateral 
our ability to make these payments when due will depend upon several factors  which may not be in our control 
these factors include our liquidity or our ability to convert assets owned by us into liquidity on or prior to such put or maturity dates and the amount by which we have been able to reduce indebtedness prior to such put or maturity date though exchanges  refinancing  extensions  collateralization or other similar transactions any of which transactions may also have the effect of reducing liquidity or liquid assets 
our ability to accomplish these goals will be affected by various factors existing at the relevant time  such as the state of the national and regional economies  local real estate conditions  available interest rate levels  the lease terms for and equity in any related collateral  our financial condition and the operating history of the collateral 
if we are unable to pay  redeem  restructure  refinance  extend or otherwise enter into transactions to satisfy any of our debt  this could result in defaults under  and acceleration of  our debt and we may be required to sell assets in significant amounts and at times when market conditions are not favorable  which could result in our incurring significant losses 
our issuance of series d preferred shares with mandatory redemption rights and warrants and share appreciation rights with put rights may increase our risk of loss if we need to satisfy these redemption rights and put rights 
we have issued our series d preferred shares of beneficial interest which provide a holder with redemption rights in defined circumstances and warrants and share appreciation rights which have put rights in defined circumstances 
we expect that we may issue additional series d preferred shares and such warrants and share appreciation rights or similar securities in the future 
while these series d preferred shares and such warrants and share appreciation rights provide that any exercise of such redemption and put rights may be satisfied by rait issuing a note  the exercise of these redemption and put rights may adversely affect our liquidity and reduce amounts available for distribution to our shareholders 
we may seek to acquire  redeem  restructure  refinance or otherwise enter into transactions to satisfy our debt which may include any combination of material payments of cash  issuances of our debt and or equity securities  sales or exchanges of our assets or other methods 
we are aware that our collateralized debt obligation  or cdo  notes payable are currently trading at discounts to their respective face amounts and our other indebtedness may trade at such discounts in the future 
in order to reduce future cash interest payments  as well as future principal amounts due upon any applicable put dates  at maturity or upon redemption  or to otherwise benefit rait  we may  from time to time  purchase such cdo notes payable or other indebtedness for cash  in exchange for our equity or debt securities  or for any combination of cash and our equity or debt securities  in each case in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  exchange offers and consent solicitations or otherwise 
we will evaluate any such transactions in light of then existing market conditions  contractual restrictions and other factors  taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material and may materially reduce our liquidity or reduce or eliminate our ability to convert assets into liquidity 
any material issuances of our equity securities may have a material dilutive effect on our current shareholders 
if our securitizations secured primarily by commercial real estate loans  rait i and rait ii  were to fail to meet their performance tests  including over collateralization requirements  our cash flow would be materially reduced 
the terms of the securitizations we have structured generally provide that the principal amount of assets must exceed the principal balance of the related securities issued by them by a certain amount  commonly referred to as over collateralization 
the securitization terms provide that  if delinquencies and or losses exceed specified levels based on the analysis by the rating agencies or any financial guaranty insurer of the characteristics of the assets collateralizing the securities issued in the securitization  the required level of over collateralization may be increased or may be prevented from decreasing as would otherwise be permitted if losses or delinquencies did not exceed those levels 
in addition  a failure by a securitization to satisfy an over collateralization test typically results in accelerated distributions to the holders of the senior debt securities issued by the securitization entity 
our equity holdings and  when we acquire debt interests in securitizations  our debt interests  and our subordinated management fees  if any  are subordinate in right of payment to the other classes of debt securities issued by the securitization entity 
other tests based on delinquency levels or other criteria may restrict our ability to receive cash distributions from assets collateralizing the securities issued by the securitization entity or our ability to effectively manage the assets held in the securitizations 
we cannot assure you that any performance test will be satisfied 
we currently receive a substantial portion of our cash flow from rait i and rait ii through our retained interests in these securitizations and management fees paid to us for managing these securitizations 
if either or both of these securitizations were to fail to meet their respective over collateralization or other tests  our cash flow would be materially reduced 
the failure of securitizations in which we hold retained interests collateralized primarily by investment in debt securities  taberna viii  and taberna ix  to meet their performance tests has reduced  and we expect will continue to reduce  the cash flow we receive from these securitizations 
our remaining consolidated securitizations collateralized primarily by investments in debt securities  taberna viii and taberna ix  have not passed some of their over collateralization tests 
as a consequence  distributions to senior debt have been accelerated  resulting in the cessation of distributions on the subordinated debt and equity we hold in these securitizations as well as our subordinated management fees from these securitizations 
this has substantially reduced the cash flow we receive from these securitizations 
because we do not expect these securitizations will meet these tests for the foreseeable future  we expect that our cash flows from these transactions will remain limited to the senior management fees received from them 
we receive collateral management fees pursuant to collateral management agreements for services we provide as the collateral manager of rait i  rait ii  taberna preferred funding i  ltd  or taberna i  taberna viii and taberna ix 
if a collateral management agreement is terminated or if the securities serving as collateral for a securitization are prepaid or go into default  the collateral management fees will be reduced or eliminated 
we receive collateral management fees pursuant to collateral management agreements for acting as the collateral manager of rait i  rait ii  taberna i  taberna viii and taberna ix 
if all the notes issued by one of those securitizations are redeemed  or if the collateral management agreement is otherwise terminated  we will no longer receive collateral management fees from that securitization 
in general  a collateral management agreement may be terminated both with and without cause at the direction of holders of a specified supermajority in principal amount of the notes issued by the securitization 
furthermore  such fees are based on the total amount of collateral held by the securitizations 
if the securities serving as collateral for a securitization are prepaid or go into default  we will receive lower collateral management fees than expected or the collateral management fees may be eliminated 
in addition  collateral management agreements typically provide that if certain over collateralization tests are failed  the collateral management agreement may be terminated by a vote of the security holders resulting in our loss of management fees from these securitizations 
if any of our securitizations fail to meet over collateralization tests relevant to the securitization s most senior existing debt  an event of default may occur 
upon an event of default  our ability to manage the securitization may be terminated and our ability to attempt to cure any defaults in the securitization would be limited  which would increase the likelihood of a reduction or elimination of cash flow and returns to us in those securitizations for an indefinite time 
our investments in securitizations are exposed to greater uncertainty and risk of loss than investments in higher grade securities in these securitizations 
when we securitize assets such as commercial mortgage loans  mezzanine loans and trups  the various tranches of investment grade and non investment grade debt obligations and equity securities have differing priorities and rights to the cash flows of the underlying assets being securitized 
we structured our securitization transactions to enable us to place debt and equity securities with investors in the capital markets at various pricing levels based on the credit position created for each tranche of debt and equity securities 
the higher rated debt tranches have priority over the lower rated debt securities and the equity securities issued by the particular securitization entity with respect to payments of interest and principal using the cash flows from the collateral assets 
the relative cost of capital increases as each tranche of capital becomes further subordinated  as does the associated risk of loss if cash flows from the assets are insufficient to repay fully interest and principal or pay dividends 
since we own in many cases the bbb  bb  b and unrated debt and equity classes of securitizations  we are in a first loss position because the rights of the securities that we hold are subordinate in right of payment and in liquidation to the rights of higher rated debt securities issued by the securitization entities 
accordingly  we have incurred and may in the future incur significant losses when investing in these securities 
in the event of default  we may not be able to recover all of our respective investments in these securities 
in addition  we may experience significant losses if the underlying portfolio has been overvalued or if the values subsequently decline and  as a result  less collateral is available to satisfy interest  principal and dividend payments due on the related securities 
the prices of lower credit quality securities are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than higher rated investments  but are more sensitive to economic downturns or developments specific to a particular issuer 
current credit market conditions have caused a decline in the price of lower credit quality securities because the ability of obligors on the underlying assets to make principal  interest and dividend payments may be impaired 
in addition  existing credit support in a number of the securitizations in which we have invested have been  and may in the future be  insufficient to protect us against loss of our investments in these securities 
a number of the securitizations in which we have invested have suffered events of default or other events resulting in the termination for the foreseeable future of any distributions on the subordinated securities we hold 
representations and warranties made by us in connection with loan sales to securitization vehicles may subject us to liability that could result in loan losses and could harm our operating results and  therefore distributions we make to our shareholders 
in connection with loan sales to securitization vehicles  we are required to make representations and warranties regarding  among other things  the borrowers  guarantors  collateral  originators and servicers of the loans sold to the depositor of such assets into securitization trusts 
many of the representations and warranties we are required to make are based on similar representations and warranties made to us by the borrowers and guarantors and or on opinion letters  reports or insurance policies issued by third party providers 
while we have no reason to believe that any of the representations and warranties made to us are inaccurate  untrue or misleading in any material respect  we rely on them in making our representations and warranties without independent verification of such matters 
if any of the representations or warranties that we make are found subsequently to be incorrect  the depositor and certain other principal loan sellers may have recourse against us including  without limitation  requiring us to cure the breach or repurchase the asset s 
while we generally have recourse to loan originators if not us  borrowers  guarantors and or other third parties whose representations  warranties  certifications  reports and or other statements or work product we relied upon in making our representations and warranties  the originators  borrowers  guarantors and other third parties may not be able to honor their obligations to us 
we generally attempt to limit the potential remedies available to the depositor and other indemnified parties to the potential remedies that we have against the originators from whom we acquired the assets or the other responsible parties 
however  in some cases  the remedies available to the depositor or other indemnified parties may be broader than those available to us against the originators of the assets or the other responsible parties and  in the event the depositor or other indemnified parties enforces their remedies against us  we may not always be able to enforce whatever remedies are available to us against the originators of the loans or the other responsible parties 
furthermore  if we discover  prior to the securitization of an asset  that there is any fraud or misrepresentation with respect to the origination of such asset and the originator fails to repurchase the asset  then we may not be able to sell the asset or we may have to sell it at a discount 
our financing arrangements contain covenants that restrict our operations  and any default under these arrangements would inhibit our ability to grow our business  increase revenue and pay distributions to our shareholders 
our financing arrangements contain restrictions  covenants and events of default 
failure to meet or satisfy any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements 
these agreements may contain cross default provisions so that an event of default under one agreement will trigger an event of default under other agreements 
defaults generally give our lenders the right to declare all amounts outstanding under their particular credit agreement to be immediately due and payable  and enforce their rights by foreclosing on or otherwise liquidating collateral pledged under these agreements 
these restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities 
furthermore  our default under any of our financing arrangements could materially reduce our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
we operate in a highly competitive market which may harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
historically  we have been subject to significant competition in all of our business lines 
we compete with many third parties engaged in finance and real estate investment activities  including other reits  specialty finance companies  savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  mutual funds  institutional investors  investment banking firms and broker dealers  property managers  investment advisers  lenders  governmental bodies and other entities 
with respect to our sponsored companies  we compete with other sponsors of offerings by commercial real estate businesses for access to debt and equity capital 
some of these competitors have  or in the future may have  substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk 
as such  they have the ability to make larger loans and to reduce the risk of loss from any one loan by having a more diversified loan portfolio 
they may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from  among other things  a lower cost of  and greater access to  capital and enhanced operating efficiencies 
an increase in the general availability of funds to lenders  or a decrease in the amount of borrowing activity  may increase competition for making loans and may reduce obtainable yields or increase the credit risk inherent in the available loans 
competition may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us 
it may also result in higher prices  lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs  making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms and reducing the fee income we realize from the origination  structuring and management of securitizations 
it may also make it more difficult to obtain appreciation interests and increase the price  and thus reduce potential yields  on discounted loans we acquire 
with respect to our sponsored companies  competition may make it harder for our sponsored companies to raise capital 
we face significant competition in our investments in real estate from other owners  operators and developers of properties  many of which own properties similar to ours in markets where we operate 
such competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and reduce the rents we are able to charge 
these competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties  which may result in their owners being willing to rent space at lower rental rates than we would or providing greater tenant improvement allowances or other leasing concessions 
this combination of circumstances could adversely affect our revenues and financial performance 
loss of our management team or the ability to attract and retain key employees could harm our business 
the real estate finance business is very labor intensive 
we depend on our management team to manage our investments and attract customers for financing by  among other things  developing relationships with issuers  financial institutions and others 
the market for skilled personnel is highly competitive and has historically experienced a high rate of turnover 
due to the nature of our business  we compete for qualified personnel not only with companies in our business  but also in other sectors of the financial services industry 
competition for qualified personnel may lead to increased hiring and retention costs 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract or retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs or at all 
if we are unable to attract or retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel at manageable costs  it could impair our ability to manage our investments and execute our investment strategies successfully  thereby reducing our earnings 
our board of trustees may change our policies without shareholder consent 
our board of trustees reviews our policies developed by management and  in particular  our investment policies 
our board of trustees may amend our policies or approve transactions that deviate from these policies without a vote of or notice to our shareholders 
policy changes could adversely affect the market price of our shares and our ability to make distributions 
our board of trustees cannot take any action to disqualify us as a reit or to otherwise revoke our election to be taxed as a reit without the approval of a majority of our outstanding voting shares 
our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of business  and we may enter into new businesses  make future strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures  each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business 
our organizational documents do not limit us to our current business lines 
accordingly  we may pursue growth through strategic investments  acquisitions or joint ventures  which may include entering into new lines of business 
in addition  we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other companies  including reits  managers of investment products or originators of real estate debt 
to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions  enter into joint ventures  or enter into a new line of business  we will face numerous risks and uncertainties  including risks associated with the required investment of capital and other resources  the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk  combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements including those required under the internal revenue code and the investment company act 
entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar  or from which we are currently exempt  and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk 
if a new business generates insufficient revenue or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
in the case of joint ventures  we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon  and subject to liability  losses or reputation damage relating to  systems  controls and personnel that are not under our control 
we engage in transactions with related parties and our policies and procedures regarding these transactions may be insufficient to address any conflicts of interest that may arise 
under our code of business conduct  we have established procedures regarding the review  approval and ratification of transactions which may give rise to a conflict of interest between us and any employee  officer  trustee  their immediate family members  other businesses under their control and other related persons 
in the ordinary course of our business operations  we have ongoing relationships and have engaged in transactions with several related entities 
these procedures do not guarantee that all potential conflicts will be identified  reviewed or sufficiently addressed 
our transactions with  and investments in  certain securitization vehicles may create perceived or actual conflicts of interest 
we have engaged in transactions with  and invested in  certain of the securitization vehicles under which we also serve as collateral manager  and may do so in the future 
these transactions have included  and may include in the future  surrendering for cancellation notes we hold issued by these vehicles and exchanges of our or others securities with these vehicles for assets collateralizing these vehicles 
in addition  we have previously  and may in the future  purchase investments in these vehicles that are senior or junior to  or have rights and interests different from or adverse to  other investors or credit support providers in the debt or other securities of such securitization vehicles 
such situations may create perceived or actual conflicts of interest between us and such other investors or credit support providers for such investors 
our interests in such transactions and investments may conflict with the interests of such other investors or credit support providers at the time of origination or in the event of a default or restructuring of a securitization vehicle or underlying assets 
furthermore  if we are involved in structuring the securitization vehicles or such securitization vehicles are structured as our subsidiaries  then our managers may have conflicts between us and other entities managed by them that purchase debt or other securities in such securitization vehicles with regard to setting subordination levels  determining interest rates  pricing the securities  providing for divesting or deferring distributions that would otherwise be made to equity interests  or otherwise setting the amounts and priorities of distributions to the holders of debt and equity interests in the securitization vehicles 
although we seek to make decisions with respect to our securitization vehicles in a manner that we believe is fair and consistent with the operative legal documents governing these vehicles  perceived or actual conflicts may create dissatisfaction among the other investors in such vehicles or litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 
appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and our reputation could be damaged if we fail to deal appropriately with one or more perceived or actual conflicts of interest 
regulatory scrutiny of  or litigation in connection with  such conflicts of interest could materially adversely affect our ability to manage or generate income or cash flow from our securitizations business  cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract investors for future vehicles 
the organization and management of our sponsored companies may create conflicts of interest 
we are currently sponsoring  and may sponsor in the future  the offerings of sponsored companies  including the offering of irt 
we expect the sponsored companies will be managed by us and will not be listed on a major exchange 
the sponsored companies currently hold  or may hold in the future  assets that we determine should be acquired by them and doing so may create conflicts of interest  including between investors in any sponsored companies and our shareholders  since many investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for one or more of the sponsored companies and other investment vehicles 
additionally  our management and other real estate and debt finance professionals may face conflicts of interest in allocating their time among rait and the sponsored companies 
although as a company we will seek to make these decisions in a manner that we believe is fair and consistent with the operative legal documents governing these investment vehicles  the transfer or allocation of these assets may give rise to investor dissatisfaction or litigation or regulatory enforcement actions 
appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest 
regulatory scrutiny of  or litigation in connection with  conflicts of interest would have a material adverse effect on our reputation which would materially adversely affect our ability to manage or generate income or cash flow from our sponsored companies and our ability to attract investors for future vehicles 
our ability to raise capital and attract investors in our sponsored companies is critical to their respective success and ability to grow and depends on our ability to attract a sales force in our subsidiary  independence securities  our affiliated licensed broker dealer responsible for such capital raising 
the sponsored companies will depend upon our ability to attract purchasers of equity interests  which will depend largely upon the efforts of the sales force in independence securities  our affiliated licensed broker dealer responsible for such capital raising 
our ability to grow our sponsored companies will depend on our ability to retain and motivate our sales force and other key personnel and to strategically recruit  retain and compensate new personnel 
however  we may not be successful in our efforts to recruit  retain and motivate the required personnel as the market for qualified professionals is extremely competitive 
if we do not retain an effective sales force  or our sales professionals join competitors or form competing companies  it could limit the ability of our sponsored companies to raise capital  which would reduce their ability to carry out their business strategy and reduce our ability to derive income and other benefits from our sponsored companies 
we are exposed to loss if lenders under our repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities or other short term debt liquidate the portfolio assets collateralizing or otherwise providing credit support for such debt 
moreover  assets financed by us pursuant to our repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities or other short term debt may not be suitable for refinancing through  or sales to  future securitization transactions  which may require us to seek more costly financing for these assets  to liquidate assets or to repurchase these assets 
we have entered into repurchase agreements  and may in the future enter into other repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities or other debt with similar terms 
our lenders have the right under our current repurchase agreements  and may have the right under such other debt  to liquidate assets acquired thereunder upon the occurrence of certain events  such as an event of default 
we are exposed to loss if the proceeds received by the lender upon any such liquidation are insufficient to satisfy our obligation to the lender 
we are also subject to the risk that the assets subject to such repurchase agreements  warehouse facilities or other debt with similar terms might not be suitable for refinancing through  or sales to  future securitization transactions 
if we were unable to refinance these assets through  or sell these assets to  future securitization transactions  we might be required to seek more costly financing for these assets  to liquidate assets or to repurchase assets under time constraints that may not produce the optimal return to us 
we will lose money on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transaction defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the transaction term  or if the value of the underlying security has declined as of the end of the term or if we default on our obligations under the repurchase agreement 
when we engage in a repurchase transaction  we generally sell securities to the transaction counterparty and receive cash from the counterparty 
the counterparty must resell the securities back to us at the end of the term of the transaction 
because the cash we receive from the counterparty when we initially sell the securities to the counterparty is less than the market value of those securities  if the counterparty defaults on its obligation to resell the securities back to us we will incur a loss on the transaction 
we will also incur a loss if the value of the underlying securities has declined as of the end of the transaction term  as we will have to repurchase the securities for their initial value but would receive securities worth less than that amount 
any losses we incur on our repurchase transactions could reduce our earnings  and thus our cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
our financing of our reit qualifying assets with repurchase agreements and warehouse facilities could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
we have entered into and intend to enter into  sale and repurchase agreements under which we nominally sell certain reit qualifying assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets 
we believe that we will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as the owners of the assets that are the subject of any such agreement notwithstanding that we may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement 
it is possible  however  that the internal revenue service  or irs  could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement  in which case our ability to qualify as a reit would be adversely affected because it would reduce the amount of assets that helps us meet relevant reit asset tests 
similarly  if any of our reit qualifying assets are subject to a repurchase agreement and are sold by the counterparty in connection with a margin call  the loss of those assets could impair our ability to qualify as a reit because it would reduce the amount of assets that helps us meet relevant reit asset tests 
accordingly  unlike other reits  we may be subject to additional risk regarding our ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a reit 
if we deconsolidate any of rait i  rait ii  taberna viii or taberna ix or our sponsored companies  it may have a material effect on our financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and the accounts of our majority owned and or controlled subsidiaries and of entities that are variable interest entities  or vies  where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of such entities in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  consolidation 
if we were to cease serving as the collateral manager for any of rait i  rait ii  taberna viii or taberna ix and or if we determined that our retained interests in any such securitizations no longer made us its primary beneficiary  our determination to consolidate such securitization could change 
if we deconsolidate any of these securitizations for these or any other reasons  such deconsolidation would have a material effect on our financial statements  including a material reduction of our assets  liabilities  equity and income 
similarly  we expect that the securities offerings we are sponsoring for our sponsored companies will result in our holding minority interests in the sponsored companies 
if we held minority interests  if we were to cease serving as the advisor for any sponsored company for any reason and or if we determined that our retained interests in any such sponsored company no longer made us its primary beneficiary that could affect our determination to consolidate such sponsored company 
we have contributed a substantial amount of assets to irt and may make similar transfers of our assets to other sponsored companies in the future and irt and these other sponsored companies may acquire other assets and otherwise engage in significant activity while we consolidate them 
if we deconsolidate irt or any sponsored company that engaged in significant activity while we consolidated it for these or any other reasons  such deconsolidation may have a material effect on our financial statements  including a material reduction of our assets  liabilities  equity and income 
quarterly results may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future quarterly performance 
our quarterly operating results could fluctuate  therefore  you should not rely on past quarterly results to be indicative of our performance in future quarters 
factors that could cause quarterly operating results to fluctuate include  among others  variations in our investment origination volume  variations in the timing of repayments of debt financing  variations in the amount of time between our receipt of the proceeds of a securities offering and our investment of those proceeds in loans or real estate  market conditions that result in increased cost of funds  the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets  general economic conditions and other factors referred to elsewhere in this section 
risks related to our investments our reserves for loan losses may prove inadequate  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we maintain loan loss reserves to protect against potential losses and conduct a review of the adequacy of these reserves on a quarterly basis 
our general loan loss reserve reflects management s then current estimation of the probability and severity of losses within our portfolio  based on this quarterly review 
in addition  our determination of asset specific loan loss reserves relies on material estimates regarding the fair value of loan collateral 
estimation of ultimate loan losses  provision expenses and loss reserves is a complex and subjective process 
as such  there can be no assurance that management s judgment will prove to be correct and that reserves will be adequate over time to protect against potential future losses 
such losses could be caused by factors including  but not limited to  unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific assets  borrowers  industries in which our borrowers operate or markets in which our borrowers or their properties are located 
if our reserves for credit losses prove inadequate we may suffer additional losses which would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations 
we may not realize gains or income from investments and have realized  and may continue to realize  losses from some of our investments  including our portfolio of debt securities 
we seek to generate both current income and capital appreciation 
however  our investments may not appreciate in value and  in fact  a substantial portion of our investments have declined  and may continue to decline  in value 
in addition  some of the financings that we originated and the loans and securities in which we invest have defaulted  and may continue to be in default on interest and or principal payments 
accordingly  we may not be able to realize gains or income from investments and may realize losses 
any gains that we do realize may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience 
any income that we realize may not be sufficient to offset our respective expenses 
our portfolio of debt securities has been adversely affected by  and may continue to be adversely affected by  economic developments affecting the business sectors in which our borrowers operate  including homebuilders  residential mortgage providers  commercial mortgage providers  office  specialty finance  retail  hospitality and storage  resulting in a substantial reduction in their fair value which adversely affects our financial performance and a substantial decrease in the cash flow we receive from the securitizations holding debt securities 
we cannot assure you that the fair value we reflect for any asset or liability in any particular reporting period will not change adversely in a subsequent reporting period 
uninsured and underinsured losses may affect the value of  or our return from  our real estate 
our properties  and the properties underlying our loans  have comprehensive insurance in amounts we believe are sufficient to permit the replacement of the properties in the event of a total loss  subject to applicable deductibles 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as earthquakes  sinkholes  floods  hurricanes and terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable 
also  inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors might make it impractical to use insurance proceeds to replace a damaged or destroyed property 
if any of these or similar events occurs  it may reduce our return from an affected property and the value of our investment 
real estate with environmental problems may create liability for us 
the existence of hazardous or toxic substances on a property will adversely affect its value and our ability to sell or borrow against the property 
contamination of real estate by hazardous substances or toxic wastes not only may give rise to a lien on that property to assure payment of the cost of remediation  but also can result in liability to us as owner  operator or lender for that cost 
many environmental laws can impose liability whether we know of  or are responsible for  the contamination 
in addition  if we arrange for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances at another site  we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up and removing those substances from the site  even if we neither own nor operate the disposal site 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses  and may materially limit our use of our properties and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  future or amended laws  or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing environmental requirements  may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
our investment portfolio may have material geographic  sector  property type and sponsor concentrations 
we may have material geographic concentrations related to our investments in commercial real estate loans and properties 
the reits and real estate operating companies in whose securities we invest in may also have material geographic concentrations related to their investments in real estate  loans secured by real estate or other investments 
we also have material concentrations in the property types that comprise our commercial loan portfolio and in the industry sectors that comprise our unsecured securities portfolio 
we also have material concentrations in the sponsors of properties that comprise our commercial loan portfolio 
where we have any kind of concentration risk in our investments  an adverse development in that area of concentration could reduce the value of our investment and our return on that investment and  if the concentration affects a material amount of our investments  impair our ability to execute our investment strategies successfully  reduce our earnings and reduce our ability to make distributions 
our due diligence efforts before making an investment may not identify all the risks related to that investment 
before originating a loan or investment for  or making a loan to or investment in  an entity  we will assess the strength and skills of the entity s management and other factors that we believe will determine the success of the loan or investment 
in making the assessment and otherwise conducting customary due diligence  we expect to rely on available resources and  in some cases  an investigation by third parties 
this process is particularly important and subjective with respect to newly organized entities because there may be little or no information publicly available about the entities 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the due diligence processes we conduct will uncover all relevant facts or that any investment will be successful 
our investments are relatively illiquid which may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises and any sales may be at a loss to us 
our commercial real estate loans and our investments in real estate are relatively illiquid investments and we may be unable to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions or dispose of these assets quickly or at all in the event we need additional liquidity 
we make and hold investments in securities issued by private companies and other illiquid investments 
a portion of these investments may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities 
the illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises and may impair the value of these investments 
any sales of investments we make may result in our recognizing a loss on the sale 
our subordinated real estate investments such as mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests in entities owning real estate involve increased risk of loss 
we invest in mezzanine loans and other forms of subordinated financing  such as investments consisting of preferred equity interests in entities owning real estate 
because of their subordinate position  these subordinated investments carry a greater credit risk than senior lien financing  including a substantially greater risk of non payment 
if a borrower defaults on our subordinated investment or on debt senior to us  our subordinated investment will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid off  which may result in our being unable to recover the full amount  or any  of our investment 
a decline in the real estate market could reduce the value of the property so that the aggregate outstanding balances of senior liens may exceed the value of the underlying property 
where debt senior to our investment exists  the presence of inter creditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents  assign our loans  accept prepayments  exercise our remedies through standstill periods and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers 
bankruptcy and borrower litigation can significantly increase the time needed for us to acquire the underlying collateral in the event of a default  during which time the collateral may decline in value 
in addition  there are significant costs and delays associated with the foreclosure process 
in the event of a default on a senior loan  we may elect to make payments  if we have the right to do so  in order to prevent foreclosure on the senior loans 
when we originate or acquire a subordinated investment  we may not have the right to service senior loans 
the servicers of the senior loans are responsible to the holders of those loans  whose interests will likely not coincide with ours  particularly in the event of a default 
accordingly  the senior loans may not be serviced in a manner advantageous to us 
it is also possible that  in some cases  a due on sale clause included in a senior mortgage  which accelerates the amount due under the senior mortgage in case of the sale of the property  may apply to the sale of the property if we foreclose  increasing our risk of loss 
we have loans that are not collateralized by recorded or perfected liens on the real estate underlying our loans 
some of the loans not collateralized by liens are secured instead by deeds in lieu of foreclosure  also known as pocket deeds 
a deed in lieu of foreclosure is a deed executed in blank that the holder is entitled to record immediately upon a default in the loan 
loans that are not collateralized by recorded or perfected liens are subordinate not only to existing liens encumbering the underlying property  but also to future judgments or other liens that may arise as well as to the claims of general creditors of the borrower 
moreover  filing a deed in lieu of foreclosure with respect to these loans will usually constitute an event of default under any related senior debt 
any such default would require us to assume or pay off the senior debt in order to protect our investment 
furthermore  in a borrower s bankruptcy  we will have materially fewer rights than secured creditors and  if our loan is secured by equity interests in the borrower  fewer rights than the borrower s general creditors 
our rights also will be subordinate to the lien like rights of the bankruptcy trustee 
moreover  enforcement of our loans against the underlying properties will involve a longer  more complex  and likely  more expensive legal process than enforcement of a mortgage loan 
in addition  we may lose lien priority in many jurisdictions  to persons who supply labor and materials to a property 
for these and other reasons  the total amount that we may recover from one of our investments may be less than the total amount of that investment or our cost of an acquisition of an investment 
we may not control the special servicing of the mortgage loans or other debt underlying the debt securities in which we invest and  in such cases  the special servicer may take actions that could adversely affect our interest 
in circumstances where we do not maintain a first mortgage position  overall control over the special servicing of the mortgage loans or other debt underlying the debt securities in which we invest may be held by a directing certificate holder which is typically appointed by the holders of the most subordinate class of such debt security then outstanding 
we ordinarily do not have the right to appoint the directing certificate holder 
in connection with the servicing of the specially serviced loans  the related special servicer may  at the direction of the directing certificate holder  take actions that could adversely affect our interest 
acquisitions of discounted loans may involve increased risk of loss 
we may acquire existing loans at a discount from both the outstanding balances of the loans and the appraised value of the properties underlying the loans 
these loans typically are in default under the original loan terms or other requirements and are subject to forbearance agreements 
a forbearance agreement typically requires a borrower to pay to the lender all revenue from a property after payment of the property s operating expenses in return for the lender s agreement to withhold exercising its rights under the loan documents 
acquiring loans at a discount involves a substantially higher degree of risk of non collection than loans that conform to institutional underwriting criteria 
we do not acquire a loan unless material steps have been taken toward resolving problems with the loan  or its underlying property 
financing with high loan to value ratios may involve increased risk of loss 
a loan to value ratio is the ratio of the amount of our financing  plus the amount of any senior indebtedness  to the appraised value of the property underlying the loan 
we expect to continue to hold loans with high loan to value ratios 
by reducing the margin available to cover fluctuations in property value  a high loan to value ratio increases the risk that  upon default  the amount obtainable from the sale of the underlying property may be insufficient to repay the financing 
preferred equity investments in reits and real estate operating companies may involve a greater risk of loss than traditional debt financing and specific risks relating to particular issuers 
we have invested  and may continue to invest in preferred securities of reits and real estate operating companies  depending upon our ability to finance such assets directly or indirectly in accordance with our financing strategy 
preferred equity investments involve a higher degree of risk than traditional debt financing due to a variety of factors  including that such investments are subordinate to debt and are not secured by property underlying the investment 
furthermore  should an issuer of preferred equity default on our investment  we would only be able to proceed against the issuer  and not the property owned by the issuer 
in most cases  a preferred equity holder has no recourse against an issuer for a failure to pay stated dividends  rather  unpaid dividends typically accrue and the preferred shareholder maintains a liquidation preference in the event of a liquidation of the issuer of the preferred securities 
an issuer may not have sufficient assets to satisfy any liquidation preference to which we may be entitled 
as a result  we may not recover some or all of our investments in preferred equity securities 
the commercial mortgage loans in which we invest and the commercial mortgage loans underlying the cmbs in which we invest are subject to delinquency  foreclosure and loss  which could result in losses to us that may result in reduced earnings or losses and reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders 
we hold substantial portfolios of commercial mortgage loans and cmbs which are secured by multi family or other commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure 
the ability of a borrower to repay a non recourse loan secured by an income producing property typically depends primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower 
if the net operating income of the property is reduced  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
net operating income of an income producing property can be affected by  among other things tenant mix  success of tenant businesses  property management decisions  property location and condition  competition from comparable types of properties  changes in laws that increase operating expense or limit rents that may be charged  any need to address environmental contamination at the property  the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property  changes in national  regional or local economic conditions and or specific industry segments  declines in regional or local real estate values  declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates  increases in interest rates  real estate tax rates and other operating expenses  changes in governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  including environmental legislation  acts of god  terrorism  social unrest and civil disturbances 
in the event of any default under a commercial mortgage loan held directly by us  we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a commercial mortgage loan borrower  the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the bankruptcy court  and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law 
foreclosure of a commercial mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process  which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan 
cmbs evidence interests in or are secured by a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial mortgage loans 
accordingly  the mortgage backed securities in which we invest are subject to all of the risks of the underlying mortgage loans 
if we are unable to improve the performance of commercial real estate properties we take control of in connection with restructurings  workouts and foreclosures of investments  our financial performance may be adversely affected 
we have taken control of properties underlying our commercial real estate investments in connection with restructurings  workouts and foreclosures of these investments 
if we are unable to improve the performance of these properties from their performance under their prior owners  our cash flow may be adversely affected if the properties cash flow is insufficient to support payments due on any related debt and we may not be able to sell these properties at a price that will allow us to recover our investment 
we may need to make significant capital improvements to our properties in order to remain competitive 
our investments in real estate may face competition from newer  more updated properties 
in order to remain competitive  we may need to make significant capital improvements to these properties 
in addition  if we need to re lease a property  we may need to make significant tenant improvements 
any financing of such improvements may reduce our ability to operate the property profitably and  if financing is not available  we may be use our available cash resources which would reduce our cash flow  liquidity and ability to make distributions to shareholders 
lease expirations  lease defaults and lease terminations may adversely affect our revenue 
lease expirations  lease defaults and lease terminations may result in reduced revenue from our real estate if the lease payments received from replacement tenants are less than the lease payments received from the expiring  defaulting or terminating tenants 
in addition  lease defaults by one or more significant tenants  lease terminations by tenants following events causing significant damage to the property or takings by eminent domain  or the failure of tenants under expiring leases to elect to renew their leases  could cause us to experience long periods with reduced or no revenue from a property and to incur substantial capital expenditures in order to obtain replacement tenants 
see item properties  for a ten year lease expiration schedule for our non residential properties as of december  risks relating to the fair value of our assets and liabilities a decline in the market value of the assets we finance pursuant to repurchase agreements or warehouse facilities may result in margin calls that may force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions 
our current repurchase agreements allow  and we expect any warehouse facilities and repurchase agreements we enter into in the future to allow  our lender to make margin calls that would require us to make cash payments or deliver additional assets to our lender in the event that there is a decline in the market value of the assets that collateralize our repurchase agreements or debt under our warehouse facilities 
as a result  a decline in the market value of assets collateralizing any such debt may result in our lenders initiating margin calls and requiring a pledge of additional collateral or cash 
posting additional collateral or cash to support our borrowings would reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets  which could adversely affect our business 
as a result  we could be forced to sell some of our assets in order to maintain liquidity 
forced sales typically result in lower sales prices than do market sales made in the normal course of business 
if our investments were liquidated at prices below the amortized cost basis of such investments  we would incur losses  which could result in a rapid deterioration of our financial condition 
a portion of our assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our management and  as a result  there may be uncertainty as to the value of these investments 
we reflect certain investments in securities  certain cdo notes payable  certain derivative instruments and other assets and liabilities at fair value in our balance sheet  with all changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
most of these investments are securities or other assets that are not publicly traded 
the fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable 
for further discussion of the fair value of our financial instruments  see
