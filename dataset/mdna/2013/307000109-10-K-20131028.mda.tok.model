we continue to focus on improving our purchase markups through improved price management  expansion of our global sourcing efforts  and the continued development of our private brand assortment

income taxes the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to foreign tax benefits realized in connection with the company global sourcing efforts and a decrease in the reserves for uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources general we have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents increased million  as compared to fiscal  and our operating cash flows were million 
we believe our operating cash flows  proceeds from sale leaseback transactions  and credit facilities are sufficient to fund our regular operating needs  capital expenditure program  share repurchases  cash dividend payments  and principal and interest payments 
we have availability under our two credit facilities to borrow up to million less standby letters of credit needed for collateral for our insurance programs of million to supplement operating cash flows 
during fiscal  to help supplement our operating cash flows and to support our growth initiatives  including our significant merchandise expansions and our fee development program  we had borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and had an average daily outstanding balance of million during fiscal working capital at the end of fiscal was million compared to million at the end of fiscal we believe operating cash flows and capacity under existing credit facilities will continue to provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations and growth initiatives 
restricted cash and investments we have restricted cash and investments to serve as collateral for certain of our insurance obligations that are held at our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary 
these restricted funds cannot be withdrawn from our account without the consent of the secured party 
as of august   we held million in this restricted account  of which million was included in restricted cash and investments and million was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of august   we held million in this restricted account  of which million was included in restricted cash and investments and million was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the classification between current and non current is based on the timing of expected payments of the secured insurance obligations 
previously  these obligations were collateralized using standby letters of credit under our revolving credit facilities 
we made this change to achieve savings in the cost of collateralizing our insurance obligations 
additionally  in conjunction with the sale leaseback transactions completed in fiscal and fiscal  certain proceeds from the transactions were placed into an escrow account with an independent third party in connection with like kind exchange transactions  which permits the deferral of a portion of the tax gain associated with the sale of the stores 
the company intended to use these proceeds to purchase additional new stores and was required to do so within days from the closing of the transactions to realize the deferral 
during the day deferral period  these assets were classified as restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheets 
we had no restricted cash and investments balance related to these transactions as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal fee development program and sale leaseback transactions we occupy most of our stores under operating leases 
as part of our new store growth strategy  we have created a fee development program fee development program  intended to provide us with a more cost effective means to finance the construction of new and relocated store locations 
under the company previous model for opening newly constructed stores  once a viable store site was located  a developer would acquire the land and construct a store 
store construction was funded by the developer through construction loans 
upon completion of the construction  the store would be leased to the company 
the total construction cost of the store  and ultimate lease cost to the company  would be impacted by the developer construction and financing costs 
under the fee development program  once a viable store site is located  the company acquires the land  funds the construction with its own capital  and pays the developer a fee for its work on the project 
this program results in a lower total construction cost of the store because the company weighted average borrowing rate  based on its investment grade credit rating  is lower than 
table of contents interest rates on construction loans its developers could obtain 
under this program  the company owns the store throughout the construction phase and upon completion of construction 
as the company current real estate strategy is to not own store locations  the company has used  and intends to continue to use  sale leaseback transactions to sell stores it owns as a result of the fee development program and concurrently lease them back 
by completing sale leaseback transactions  the company monetizes the value of the stores it sells 
the company then intends to re invest the proceeds into the fee development program to construct more stores 
during fiscal  we invested in projects at a cost of million under this program 
during fiscal  the company completed sale leaseback transactions under which it sold a total of stores and parcels of land to unrelated third parties for net proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
upon closing of the transactions  the company realized a gain on the sale of the stores of million  of which approximately million was recognized immediately and approximately million was deferred and will be amortized over the initial lease term 
during fiscal  the company completed sale leaseback transactions under which it sold a total of stores to unrelated third parties for net proceeds of million 
upon closing of the transactions  the company deferred a gain of approximately million realized on the sale of the stores and will amortize the gain over the initial lease term 
concurrent with these sales  we entered into agreements to lease the properties back from the purchasers over an initial lease term of years upon completion of construction 
the master leases for each transaction include an initial term of years and four  five year renewal options and provides for the company to evaluate each store individually upon certain events during the life of the lease  including individual renewal options 
the company classifies these leases as operating leases  actively uses the leased properties and considers the leases as normal leasebacks under asc credit facilities on november   the company entered into a new four year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to million 
the credit facility matures on november   and provides for two  one year extensions that require lender consent 
any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates

capital expenditures for fiscal were million  compared with million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the growth in capital expenditures during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily related to increased investments in new stores  including investments in fee development stores 
in fiscal we spent million related to new stores  million on our store renovation program  million to support our supply chain  including the completion of our eleventh distribution center  million related to corporate and technology investments  and million on existing stores 
the increase in capital expenditures during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to increased new store openings including stores opened under our fee development program  the completion of the construction of our tenth distribution center  investments in fixtures to support our expanded assortment of consumables  and investments related to renovations  relocations and expansions

additionally  in fiscal  we continued to expand our global sourcing team  develop stronger processes to help us integrate our sourcing activities with our category management efforts and expand our supplier network 
as a result of this global expansion and the increased activities being performed by our global sourcing team members  we had million of cash and cash equivalents in these foreign entities as of august  we are not dependent on dividends from our foreign 
table of contents entities to fund our domestic operations 
unremitted earnings from foreign entities  which are considered to be invested indefinitely  would become subject to us income taxes if they were remitted as dividends or were lent to a domestic entity 
cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million during fiscal to million  as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to a reduction in payments for merchandise inventories in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which was offset partially by changes in prepayments and other current assets and income taxes  all in the ordinary course of business 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease was due primarily to an increase in merchandise inventories in fiscal as noted above  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which was offset partially by changes in prepayments and other current assets and higher net income  all in the ordinary course of business

off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases included in the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments section above 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
asu requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
the asu is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those periods beginning after december  the asu will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories our inventories are valued using the retail method  based on retail prices less mark on percentages  which approximates the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
we record adjustments to inventory through cost of sales when retail price reductions  or markdowns  are taken against on hand inventory 
in addition  we make estimates and judgments regarding  among other things  initial markups  markdowns  future demand for specific product categories and market conditions  all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation 
these estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period 
while we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components  if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates 
this risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise 
we estimate inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory inventory shrinkage for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date 
the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage 
table of contents was million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts 
stores receive a physical inventory at least annually 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal property and equipment we state property and equipment at cost 
we calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
for leasehold improvements  this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease generally between five and fifteen years  including reasonably assured renewal options  or the asset s useful economic life 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the increase in gross property and equipment  before depreciation  is not commensurate with capital expenditures due to the significant amount of assets sold during the year under sale leaseback transactions 
we generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment 
we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  our impairment losses on fixed assets  which typically relate to normal store closings  have not been material to our financial position and results of operations 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on property and equipment 
insurance liabilities we are primarily self insured for health care  property loss  workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability costs 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and employees 
our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims  and are not discounted 
we review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates 
we also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical  workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability claims 
the insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense  sales  number of vehicles  and the frequency and severity of claims 
the estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or if the historical trend is not indicative of future trends  then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction in expense  which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
we record our liabilities for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability costs on a gross basis  and record a separate insurance asset for amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  our gross liabilities and the related insurance asset are separated into current and non current amounts on the consolidated balance sheets 
our total liabilities for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability costs were million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal and million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal the current portion of the liabilities is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  and the non current portion is included in other liabilities 
the insurance assets related to these amounts totaled million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal and million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal the current portion of the assets is included in prepayments and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets  and the non current portion is included in other assets
