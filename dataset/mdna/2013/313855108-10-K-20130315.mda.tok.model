critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of equipment  environmental vehicles  vehicle mounted aerial platforms  parts  service and maintenance contracts 
the company recognizes revenue for products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
a product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
for most of the company s product sales  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped  however  occasionally title passes later or earlier than shipment due to customer contracts or letter of credit terms 
if at the outset of an arrangement the company determines the arrangement fee is not  or is presumed not to be  fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
workers compensation and product liability reserves due to the nature of the products manufactured  the company is subject to product liability claims in the ordinary course of business 
the company is partially self funded for workers compensation and product liability claims with various retention and excess coverage thresholds 
after the claim is filed  an initial liability is estimated  if any is expected  to resolve the claim 
this liability is periodically updated as more claim facts become known 
the establishment and update of liabilities for unpaid claims  including claims incurred but not reported  is based on the assessment by the company s claim administrator of each claim  an independent actuarial valuation of the nature and severity of total claims and management s estimate 
the company utilizes a third party claims administrator to pay claims  track and evaluate actual claims experience and ensure consistency in the data used in the actuarial valuation 
management believes that the reserve established at december  appropriately reflects the company s risk exposure 
the company has not established a reserve for potential losses resulting from the firefighter hearing loss litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k 
if the company is not successful in its defense after exhausting all appellate options  it will record a charge for such claims  to the extent they exceed insurance recoveries  at the appropriate time 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to its net assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october  goodwill is tested for impairment based on a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the company generally determines the fair value of its reporting units using two valuation methods the income approach discounted cash flow analysis method  and the market approach guideline public company method 
under the income approach discounted cash flow analysis method the key assumptions consider projected sales  cost of sales and operating expenses 
these assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan  growth rates for revenues and operating expenses and margin assumptions 
an additional key assumption under this approach is the discount rate  which is determined by looking at current risk free rates of capital  current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment 
if our assumptions relative to growth rates were to change or were incorrect  our fair value calculation may change  which could result in impairment 
under the market approach guideline public company method the company identified several publicly traded companies  including federal signal  which we believe have sufficiently relevant similarities 
for these companies  the company calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to ebitda 
similar to the income approach discussed above  sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and their respective growth rates are key assumptions utilized 
the market prices of the company s common stock and other guideline companies are additional key assumptions 
if these market prices increase  the estimated market value would increase 
if the market prices decrease  the estimated market value would decrease 
the results of these two methods are weighted based upon management s evaluation of the relevance of the two approaches 
in the evaluation  management determined that the income approach provided a more relevant measure of each reporting unit s fair value and used it to determine reporting unit fair value 
management used the market approach to corroborate the results of the income approach 
management used the income approach to determine fair value of the reporting units because it considers anticipated future financial performance 
the market approach is based upon historical and current economic conditions which might not reflect the long term prospects or opportunities for the business segment being evaluated 
the company had no goodwill impairments for its continuing operations in  and adverse changes to the company s business environment and future cash flows could cause us to record impairment charges in future periods  which could be material 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k for a summary of the company s goodwill and definite lived intangible assets and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k for discussion of impairment charges recorded for the discontinued fstech group 
pensions the company sponsors domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension costs 
the following table summarizes the impact that a change in these assumptions would have on the company s operating income in millions assumption change basis point increase basis point decrease discount rate return on assets employee compensation levels the weighted average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is set by reference to published  high quality bond indices 
however  these indices give only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the indices do not precisely match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan 
for this reason  we also consider the individual characteristics of the plan  such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  when setting the discount rate 
the weighted average discount rate used to measure us pension liabilities decreased from in to in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k for further discussion 
an incremental component is added for the expected return from active management based on the plan s experience and on historical information obtained from the plan s investment consultants 
these forecasted gross returns are reduced by estimated management fees and expenses  yielding a long term rate of return of per annum for the expected asset return assumption is based upon a long term view  therefore  we do not expect to see frequent changes from year to year based on positive or negative actual performance in a single year 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate recovery of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income  and other factors such as the taxing jurisdiction in which the asset is to be recovered 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent that  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
in the year ended december   we recorded a valuation allowance of million against our net domestic deferred tax assets based on our assessment of past operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
specifically  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we had three years of cumulative domestic losses for continuing operations 
in and  we recorded additional valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  against our domestic deferred tax assets 
we believe having three years of cumulative losses limits our ability to look to future taxable income as a source for recovering our deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and  as a result  we may increase or decrease our valuation allowance in future periods 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also provides guidance on de recognition and classification  and requires companies to elect and disclose their method of reporting interest and penalties on income taxes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate this risk  the company utilizes interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leveraged derivatives contracts 
interest rate risk the company manages its exposure to interest rate movements by targeting a proportionate relationship between fixed rate debt to total debt generally within percentages between and 
the company uses funded fixed rate borrowings as well as interest rate swap agreements to balance its overall fixed floating interest rate mix 
during the month of june  floating to fixed interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million matured and that portion of the company s debt was left floating rate 
since the floating rate of interest the company receives on its revolving credit facility has favorable pricing further enhanced by historically low libor rates  the company decided to maintain a percentage of floating rate debt outside of the to targets 
the following table presents the principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s total debt obligations held at december  in millions expected maturity date fair value thereafter total variable rate debt average interest rate see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this form k for a description of these agreements 
a basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates in would have increased or decreased interest expense by million  respectively 
foreign exchange rate risk although the majority of sales  expenses and cash flows are transacted in us dollars  the company has exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro and the british pound 
if average annual foreign exchange rates had collectively weakened against the us dollar by  pre tax earnings in would have decreased by million from foreign currency translation 
the company has foreign currency exposures related to buying and selling in currencies other than the local currency in which it operates 
the company utilizes foreign currency options and forward contracts to manage these risks 
forward exchange contracts are recorded as a natural hedge when the hedged item is a recorded asset or liability that is revalued each accounting period  in accordance with asc topic  foreign currency matters 
for derivatives designated as natural hedges  changes in fair values are reported in the other expense line of the consolidated statements of operations
