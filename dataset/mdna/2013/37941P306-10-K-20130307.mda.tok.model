item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note segment information included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f market overview gas turbine power generation  process and cogeneration market 
all gas turbine power plants combine a gas turbine with a generator to produce electricity 
in a simple cycle gas turbine plant  the hot exhaust coming out of the gas turbine is vented to the atmosphere through an exhaust stack 
in a combined cycle plant  the hot exhaust coming out of the gas turbine is fed into a heat recovery steam generator commonly referred to as an hrsg  the hrsg captures much of the heat from the gas turbine exhaust to generate steam  which in turn is used to power a steam turbine and generate more electricity before the exhaust is vented into the atmosphere 
we 
table of contents manufacture products that are critical components of both simple cycle and combined cycle plants  including filter houses  inlet and exhaust systems and turbine and generator components 
we also engineer and manufacture specialized diverter dampers that are used in some combined cycle plants between the gas turbines and the hrsg 
we believe manufacturers of equipment and components supporting gas turbine power plants are well positioned to benefit from the need for new or more efficient power generation infrastructure 
the advantages of power generation plants utilizing gas turbine technologies versus other technologies include lower construction costs  shorter construction periods  improved operating efficiency  lower emissions of co  minimal other environmental impact  flexibility to expand plant capacity  smaller geographical footprint  and rapid start up and shutdown time 
as a provider of equipment for simple and combined cycle gas turbine power plants  we expect to benefit from the forecasted growth of gas turbine power plant capacity related to the factors listed above 
industrial services industry and market 
the us industrial services industry is a multi billion dollar industry broadly defined as routine modification  maintenance and technical services provided to industrial facilities ranging from manufacturing facilities to power generation plants 
the industry continues to benefit from a shift towards outsourcing as plant operators seek to alleviate financial constraints  reduce labor costs  increase labor utilization and productivity and eliminate operational redundancies 
we expect that power industry demand for these services will be driven by the following factors in the future aging infrastructure 
according to the us department of energy s doe energy information administration  more than half of the electrical generating capacity in the us was placed in service before coupled with the relatively limited number of large scale power generation facilities being constructed in the us  the efforts to maintain older plants of all types and take advantage of newer and more efficient technologies at existing sites have created opportunities for companies providing these services 
increasing demand for nuclear plant maintenance 
the us currently has operating nuclear reactors that generate approximately of annual electric production 
these nuclear reactors have been in operation for an average of more than years and require extensive ongoing engineering and maintenance services to support operations and improve performance 
nuclear power plants in the us are subject to a rigorous program of us nuclear regulatory commission nrc oversight  inspection  preventive and corrective maintenance  equipment replacement and equipment testing 
nuclear power plants are required by the nrc to go offline to refuel at intervals of no more than months and to perform condition monitoring and preventive maintenance during every refueling outage 
initially  commercial nuclear power plants in the us were licensed to operate for years  reflecting the amortization period generally used by electric utility companies for large capital investments 
in  the nrc issued the first license renewal to a nuclear power plant  extending its license for an additional years beyond its original year license allowing operations to continue for the long term 
as of august  the nrc had extended the licenses of reactors  over two thirds of the us fleet 
in all  about reactors are expected to operate for years  with owners undertaking increasing modification  maintenance and construction capital projects to upgrade these facilities 

table of contents new nuclear reactor construction 
currently there are six new nuclear reactors at four sites in the early stages of construction or being re commissioned in the us our services division is involved in each of these projects at varying levels 
we are one of three contractors with a qualified and audited nuclear quality assurance nqa program which is required to perform contract services at the new build reactors 
in addition  we are one of a limited number of companies qualified to perform comprehensive services in us nuclear power plants under rules issued by the nrc 
under these rules  owners of nuclear facilities must qualify contractors by requiring the contractors to demonstrate that they will comply with nrc regulations on quality assurance  reporting of safety issues  security and control of personnel access and conduct 
with respect to capital project work  we may be engaged as a general contractor or subcontract our services to full scope engineering  procurement and construction contractor epc firms 
we maintain good relationships with those firms that may be engaged to manage the full scope of the new operations as well as with the end customers who often specifically request that we provide certain aspects of a particular project based on their historical experience with us 
business strategy our growth strategy is to build a market leadership position in our targeted segments  utilizing our strong brands  application expertise and re investment in new products and services offerings

item a 
risk factors 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors  any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results 
risk factors related to our operations a substantial portion of our services division revenue deals directly with nuclear power 
the cost of operating a nuclear power plant could cause utilities to consider less costly power generation options 
the shutdown of nuclear power plants could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the demand for our nuclear services in the services division depends on the continued operation of nuclear power plants 
if nuclear power plants do not remain cost competitive compared to other power generation options  utilities could choose to shut down operations at nuclear power plants 
the cost competitiveness of operating a nuclear power plant could be affected by factors such as an adverse change in us policy  increased maintenance costs and continued low natural gas prices 
the us government has been supportive of increased investment in nuclear power as it represents approximately of the total power generating capacity in the us however  if the us government changed its policy or if public acceptance of nuclear technology declines  demand for nuclear power could be negatively affected and potentially increase the regulation of the nuclear power industry 
because our services division deals directly with nuclear power  utilities opting to replace costly nuclear power plants with less costly power generation options could have a material effect on our operations 
if our costs exceed the estimates we use to set the fixed prices of our contracts  our earnings will be reduced 
the majority of our product sales contracts and a portion of our nuclear and industrial services contracts are entered into on a fixed price basis 
these fixed price contracts have a limited ability to recover any cost overruns 
contract prices are established based in part on our projected costs  which are subject to a number of assumptions 
the costs that we incur in connection with each contract can vary  sometimes substantially  from our original projections 
because of the large scale and complexity of our contracts  unanticipated changes may occur  such as customer budget decisions  design changes  delays in receiving permits and cost increases  as well 
table of contents as delays in delivery of our products 
we often are contractually subject to liquidated damages for late delivery 
unanticipated cost increases or delays may occur as a result of several factors  including increases in the cost of commodities primarily steel plate  labor or freight  unanticipated technical problems  suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform  requiring modified execution plans or re work  and decreases in labor efficiency realized 
cost increases or overruns that we cannot pass on to our customers or our payment of liquidated damages under our contracts will lower our earnings 
increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our gross margins 
if we are unable to control the quality or timely production of products manufactured or services provided by our subcontractors  our reputation could be adversely affected and we could lose customers 
if we are unable to recover any advance progress payments made to subcontractors  our profitability would be adversely affected 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture and assemble a substantial portion of our products as well as provide some specialty services 
subcontractors account for a significant percentage of our manufacturing costs 
the quality and timing of production by our subcontractors is not totally under our control 
our subcontractors may not always meet the level of quality control and the delivery schedules required by our customers 
the failure of our subcontractors to produce quality products in a timely manner could adversely affect our reputation and result in the cancellation of orders for our products  significant warranty and repair costs and the loss of customers 
alternatively  we could be required to move subcontract manufacturing to other locations  resulting in increased costs 
in addition  we make advance progress payments to subcontractors in anticipation of their completion of our orders 
we may be unable to recover those advances if a subcontractor fails to complete an order  which may adversely affect our profitability 
our future revenue and operating results may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
our quarterly and annual revenue and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
our product sales contracts stipulate customer specific delivery terms that  coupled with other factors beyond our control  may result in uneven recognition of revenue and earnings over time 
customer imposed delays can significantly impact the timing of revenue recognition 
due to our relatively large average contract size  our product sales volume during any given period may be concentrated in relatively few orders  intensifying the magnitude of these fluctuations 
furthermore  some of our operating costs are fixed 
as a result  we may have limited ability to reduce our operating costs in response to unanticipated decreases in our revenue or the demand for our products in any given reporting period 
therefore  our operating results in any reporting period may not be indicative of our future performance 
because we must make significant estimates related to potential costs when we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis  these costs may change significantly from reporting period to reporting period based on new project information 
for example  if labor efficiency experienced on a project is lower than we estimated at the outset of the project  the costs incurred on the project will increase and the percentage of completion may be reduced from earlier estimates 
in addition  most of our product revenue is based on fixed price contracts  and the relative profitability can vary significantly between contracts 
as a result  our profitability can vary from reporting period to reporting period based on the specific contract mix 

table of contents we may not be able to maintain or expand our business outside the us because of numerous factors outside our control 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in doing business outside the us including labor unrest  regional economic uncertainty  sovereign debt issues including the european debt crisis  political instability including unrest in the middle east  restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country  currency exchange rate fluctuations  export duties and quotas  expropriations  us and international customs and tariffs  current and changing regulatory environments  potentially adverse tax consequences  availability of financing  unfavorable commercial terms and conditions  and potential for adverse dispute resolution outcomes 
these factors may impact our ability to meet product delivery commitments in foreign countries that could result in a decline in revenue or profitability and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our business outside the us we conduct our manufacturing operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the us we have manufacturing facilities and subcontractors in many countries outside of the us including china  poland  romania  the middle east and mexico  and increasing our manufacturing footprint to localize in emerging markets is an important element of our strategy 
there are a number of risks associated with doing business internationally  including a exposure to local economic and political conditions  b social unrest such as risks of terrorism or other hostilities  c currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls  d export and import restrictions  and e the potential for shortages of trained labor 
in particular  there has been social unrest in the middle east and mexico and any increased violence in or around our manufacturing facilities could impact our business by disrupting our supply chain  and the delivery of products to customers 
in addition  the increased violence in or around our manufacturing facilities could present several risks to our employees who may be directly affected by the violence and may result in a decision by them to relocate from the area  or make it difficult for us or our subcontractors to recruit or retain talented employees 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us is unpredictable and vary from country to country 
any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our financial results 
a substantial portion of our revenue is from sales of equipment for gas turbine power plants 
during periods of declining construction of new gas turbine power plants  the market for our products is significantly diminished 
the demand for our products depends on the continued construction of gas turbine power generation plants 
the power generation equipment industry has experienced cyclical periods of slow growth or decline 
in periods of 
table of contents decreased demand for new gas turbine power plants  our customers may be more likely to decrease expenditures on the types of products and systems that we supply and  as a result  our future revenue may decrease 
these projects typically require funding from a healthy credit market as well 
as long as credit markets are tight  funding could be difficult to obtain therefore delaying or even cancelling these types of projects entirely 
a rise in the price or a shortage in the supply of natural gas could affect the profitability or operations of gas turbine power plants  which could adversely affect our future revenue 
these and other factors may temper demand for our products 
if in a particular geographic area prices of natural gas are so high or the supply of natural gas is so limited as to make the construction of new gas turbine power plants uneconomical in that geographic area  we may not derive any future revenue from projects in that geographic region unless and until those factors are reversed 
environmental laws and regulations have played a part in the increased use of gas turbine technology in various jurisdictions 
these laws and regulations may change or other jurisdictions may not adopt similar laws and regulations 
changes in existing laws and regulations could result in a reduction in the building and refurbishment of gas turbine power plants 
in addition  stricter environmental regulation could result in our customers seeking new ways of generating electricity that do not require the use of our products 
furthermore  although gas turbine power plants have lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of electricity provided than coal fired power plants  emissions from gas turbine power plants remain a concern and attempts to reduce or regulate emissions could increase the cost of gas turbine power plants and result in our customers switching to alternative sources of power 
other current power technologies  improvements to these technologies and new alternative power technologies that compete or may compete in the future with gas turbine power plants could affect our sales and profitability 
any change in the power generation industry that results in a decline in the construction of new combined cycle and simple cycle power plants or a decline in the upgrading of existing simple cycle power plants to combined cycle power plants could materially adversely affect our sales 
a small number of major customers account for a significant portion of our revenue  and the loss of any of these customers could negatively impact our business 
we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue 
in  four customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue and approximately of our backlog at the end of the year 
in  three customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue and approximately of our backlog at the end of the year 
in  three customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue and approximately of our backlog at the end of the year 
for a listing of our major customers  see note major customers and concentration of credit risk included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f other than their obligations under firm orders placed in our backlog  none of our customers have a long term contractual obligation to purchase any material amounts of products or services from us 
all of our firm orders contain cancellation provisions  which permit us to recover only our costs and a portion of our anticipated profit if a customer cancels its order 
if a customer elects to cancel  we would not realize the full amount of future revenue included in our backlog 
we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue 
because our major customers represent a large part of our business  the loss of any of our major customers could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
several of our customers have the ability to internally source some of the products we manufacture 
any increase in this activity could reduce our sales 
our business volumes with each of our largest customers are highly dependent on power generation capacity additions for our products division and on operations and maintenance budgets for us utilities for our services division 
fluctuations in any of these factors could materially adversely impact our results 

table of contents the dollar amount of our backlog  as stated at any time  is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue 
when we receive a firm order for a project from a customer  it is added to our backlog 
however  customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control and we may be unable to replace any canceled orders with new orders 
to the extent projects are delayed  the timing of our revenue could be affected 
if a customer cancels an order  we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred 
typically  however  we have no contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog contracts in the event of cancellation 
in addition  projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time 
revenue recognition occurs over extended periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays 
fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the fact that we may receive a small number of relatively large orders in any given reporting period that may be included in our backlog 
because of these large orders  our backlog in that reporting period may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent reporting periods 
our backlog  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue or of long term industry trends 
the success of our business is partially dependent upon maintaining our safety record 
our ability to obtain new business and retain our current business  particularly in our services division  is partially dependent on our continuing ability to maintain a safety record that exceeds the industry average 
if we fail to maintain superior safety performance  or if serious accidents occur in spite of our safety procedures  our revenue and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our dependence on suppliers and subcontractors could expose us to the risk of loss in our operations 
we rely significantly on suppliers to obtain necessary materials and subcontractors to perform manufacturing and services 
although we are not dependent on any single supplier or subcontractor  any substantial limitation on the availability of required suppliers or subcontractors could negatively impact our operations 
the risk of a lack of available suppliers or subcontractors may be heightened as a result of recent market and economic conditions 
to the extent we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  we could experience losses in the performance of our operations 
our former operating unit has been named as a defendant in asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
our former operating unit has been named as a defendant in a limited number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
neither we nor our predecessors ever mined  manufactured  produced or distributed asbestos fiber  the material that allegedly caused the injury underlying these actions 
the bankruptcy court s discharge order issued upon emergence from bankruptcy extinguished the claims made by all plaintiffs who had filed asbestos claims against us before that time 
we believe the bankruptcy court s discharge order should serve as a bar against any later claim filed against us  including any of our subsidiaries  based on alleged injury from asbestos at any time before emergence from bankruptcy 
in all of the asbestos cases finalized post bankruptcy  we have been successful in having such claims dismissed without liability 
moreover  during  we secured insurance coverage that will help to reimburse the defense costs and potential indemnity obligations of our former operating unit relating to these claims 
nonetheless  findings of liability on our part in any of these cases that were filed against us after we emerged from bankruptcy that remain unresolved could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
efforts to increase our size through acquisitions will involve risks that could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
we intend to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities  some of which may be material to our business and financial performance 
we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons  including acquisition financing not being available on acceptable terms or at all  
table of contents encountering difficulties identifying and executing acquisitions  increased competition for targets  which may increase acquisition costs  consolidation in our industry reducing the number of acquisition targets  and competition laws and regulations preventing us from making certain acquisitions 
in addition  there are potential risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions  including the failure to successfully integrate and realize the expected benefits of an acquisition 
for example  with any past or future acquisition  there is the possibility that the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture  technological and product synergies  economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected  management may be distracted from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate acquired businesses  we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities  unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations and systems  we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business  we may experience problems in retaining customers  and problems may arise in entering new markets in which we may have little or no experience 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations is costly  and our ongoing operations may expose us to environmental liabilities 
our operations are subject to laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or human health and safety 
we are subject to various us federal statutes and the regulations implementing them  as well as similar laws and regulations at the state and local levels and in other countries in which we operate 
if we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations  we may be subject to significant liabilities for fines  penalties or damages  or lose or be denied significant operating permits 
for example  if employees of our services division accidentally release hazardous substances while working at a customer s facility  we may be subject to fines and costs of clean up as well as lawsuits by third parties 
in addition  some environmental laws impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating releases of hazardous substances without regard to fault and on a joint and several basis  so that in some circumstances  we may be liable for costs attributable to hazardous substances released into the environment by others 
a defect in our products could result in unanticipated warranty costs or product liability not covered by our insurance  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we generally provide warranties for terms of three years or less on our products 
these warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products 
warranty claims could result in significant unanticipated costs 
the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could also temporarily delay the sale of new products and adversely affect our reputation 
in addition  we may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage 
the sale and servicing of complex  large scale equipment used in a variety of locations and climates  and 
table of contents integrating a variety of manufactured and purchased components entails an inherent risk of disputes and liabilities relating to the operation and performance of the equipment and the health and safety of the workers who operate and come into contact with the machinery 
because our products are used primarily in power plants  claims could arise in different contexts  including the following fires  explosions and power surges that can result in significant property damage or personal injury  and equipment failure that can result in personal injury or damage to other equipment in the power plant 
for example  a failure of a filter house provided by us could result in significant damage to costly precision components of the gas turbine generator that takes in conditioned air from the filter house 
this  in turn  could cause the owner of the gas turbine to seek to recover significant damages from us 
the insurance policies we maintain to cover claims of this nature are subject to deductibles and recovery limitations as well as limitations on contingencies covered  and we may  therefore  suffer losses from these claims for which no insurance recovery is available 
expiration of the price anderson act s indemnification authority could have adverse consequences on our services division 
we provide services to the nuclear industry through our services division 
the price anderson act promotes the nuclear industry by offering broad indemnification to commercial nuclear power plant operators and the doe for liabilities arising out of nuclear incidents at power plants licensed by the nrc and at doe nuclear facilities 
that indemnification protects not only the nrc licensee or doe prime contractor  but also others like us who may be doing work under contract or subcontract for a licensed power plant or under a doe prime contract 
to date  there has been no occasion for a determination of whether the price anderson act s indemnification provisions apply to all nuclear liabilities that might be incurred by a radioactive materials cleanup contractor 
the energy policy act of extended the period of coverage to include all nuclear power reactors issued construction permits through december  a problem related to our provision of services at a nuclear facility could lead to a damage claim against us for which we might not be entitled to indemnification 
in addition  any well publicized problem with those services  whether actual or perceived  could adversely affect our reputation and reduce demand for our services 
our revenue would be adversely affected if our patents and other intellectual property rights are unable to protect our proprietary products 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights to the technologies and know how used in our proprietary products and software programs 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of trade secret  unfair competition and similar laws and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
we cannot provide assurance that we can meaningfully protect all of our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology  or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology 
if we were required to commence legal actions to enforce our intellectual property or proprietary rights or to defend ourselves against claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others  we could incur substantial losses and or costs and divert management s attention from operations 

table of contents our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  including engineers  skilled workers and key officers  could have an adverse effect on us 
our ability to attract and retain qualified professional and or skilled personnel in accordance with our needs  either through direct hiring  subcontracting or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  is an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed personnel 
our ability to successfully execute our business strategy depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified  experienced mechanical  design  structural and software engineers  service technicians  marketing and sales personnel in our products and services divisions 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers  and we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers 
if we are unable to retain qualified personnel  the roles and responsibilities of those employees will need to be filled  which may require that we devote time and resources to identifying  hiring and integrating new employees 
in addition  the failure to attract and retain key employees  including officers  could impair our ability to sustain or expand our operations  to provide services to our customers and conduct our business effectively 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic slowdowns and reductions in private industry and government spending 
in times of general economic contraction  our revenue  profits and our financial condition may be adversely affected and will not necessarily rise in tandem with general economic expansion 
the industries we serve historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general slowdowns in us and international economies 
consequently  our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate depending on the demand for products and services from these industries 
orders for new electrical power generation capacity are placed by our customers with long lead times 
consequently  our bookings and revenue may rise or fall sharply as total industry orders tend to follow pronounced cycles of general expansion and contraction 
during a contraction phase  limited investment in new projects  deferrals of planned projects and project cancelations may significantly reduce our potential recognition of revenue and profits 
at the end of an expansion phase  the existence of excess capacity will negatively affect power prices which results in a reduction in new orders 
in addition to being cyclical in nature  our revenue does not correlate precisely with changes in actual or forecasted new capacity due to timing differences in revenue recognition 
during periods of declining demand for power  many of our customers may face budget shortfalls or may delay capital spending that may decrease the overall demand for our products and services 
our customers may find it more difficult to obtain project financing due to limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the global credit markets 
in addition  our customers may demand better pricing terms and their ability to timely pay our invoices may still be affected by the recent economic slowdown 
if private industry and government spending are reduced  then our revenue  net income and overall financial condition may be adversely affected 
systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate 
we depend on our information technology systems for many aspects of our business 
our business may be adversely affected if our systems are disrupted by security breaches or if we are unable to improve  upgrade  integrate or expand our systems to meet our changing needs 
a failure to successfully implement new systems could adversely affect our business 
any damage  delay or loss of critical data associated with our systems may delay or prevent certain operations and may materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents the supply and cost of materials we use in manufacturing our products fluctuates and could increase our operating costs 
steel is a significant portion of the raw materials used in our products 
local shortages of steel plate sometimes arise and it is possible that an adequate supply of steel will not continue to be available in all locations on terms acceptable to us 
the materials we use in our products are subject to price fluctuations that we cannot control 
changes in the cost of raw materials can have a significant effect on our gross margins 
rapid increases in material prices are difficult to pass through to customers 
if we are unable to pass on these higher costs  our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 
our participation in multiemployer pension plans could adversely impact our liquidity and results of operations 
we contribute to over multiemployer pension plans throughout the us we believe that our responsibility for potential withdrawal liabilities associated with participating in multiemployer pension plans is limited because the building and construction trades exemption should apply to the substantial majority of our plan contributions 
however  pursuant to the pension protection act of and other applicable law  we are exposed to other potential liabilities associated with plans that are underfunded 
as of december   we had been notified that certain pension plans were in critical funding status 
currently  certain plans are developing  or have developed  a rehabilitation plan that may call for a reduction in participant benefits or an increase in future employer contributions 
therefore  in the future  we could be responsible for potential surcharges  excise taxes and or additional contributions related to these plans which could impact our liquidity and results of operations 
additionally  market conditions and the number of participating employers remaining in each plan may result in a reorganization  insolvency or mass withdrawal that could materially affect the funded status of multiemployer plans and our potential withdrawal liability  if applicable 
we continue to actively monitor  assess and take steps to limit our potential exposure to any surcharges  excise taxes  additional contributions and or withdrawal liabilities 
foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects 
we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in us dollars or in the currencies of our expenditures 
however  we do enter into contracts that subject us to foreign exchange risks  particularly to the extent contract revenue are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
we may seek to minimize our exposure from foreign exchange risks by limiting foreign currency contracts to those currencies where we have ongoing operating expenditures or entering into hedge contracts if there are limited ongoing expenditures in the same currencies 
however  these actions may not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks 
new legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays to our customers and our operations 
members of the u 
s congress and the us environmental protection agency epa are reviewing more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing  a technology which involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production 
both the us congress and the epa are studying whether there is any link between hydraulic fracturing and soil or ground water contamination or any impact on public health or the environment 
legislation has been introduced before congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process 
in addition  some states have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing 
any new laws  regulation or permitting requirements regarding hydraulic fracturing could lead to delays in the construction of new gas turbine power plants and or increased operating costs for existing gas turbine power plants which could negatively impact demand for our products 

table of contents we are subject to anti bribery laws in the countries in which we operate 
failure to comply with these laws could result in our becoming subject to penalties and the disruption of our business activities 
many of the countries in which we transact business have laws that restrict the offer or payment of anything of value to government officials or other persons with the intent of gaining business or favorable government action 
we are subject to these laws in addition to being governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act restricting these types of activities 
in addition to prohibiting certain bribery related activity with foreign officials and other persons  these laws provide for recordkeeping and reporting obligations 
any failure by us  our subcontractors  agents or others who work for us on our behalf to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties 
the failure to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could also result in the disruption of our business activities 
a change in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our earnings  which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations 
we continue to assess the impact of various legislative proposals  including us federal and state proposals  and modifications to existing tax treaties  that could result in a material increase in our taxes 
we cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation 
however  if such proposals were to be enacted  or if modifications were to be made to certain existing treaties  the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on us  including increasing our tax burden  increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
work disruptions resulting from the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements or otherwise could result in increased operating costs and affect our operating performance 
certain of our temporary services division craft employees  koontz wagner employees and mexico employees are represented by labor unions with which we have collective bargaining agreements 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disruptions associated with a lengthy strike or the expiration or renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements or other work stoppage at our mexico facility or at our customer locations  which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue 
new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses  may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers 
on august   under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the sec adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals  known as conflict minerals  in their products  whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties 
we are currently evaluating whether these requirements apply to us 
companies that are subject to the rules must conduct due diligence  disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing  availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain components incorporated in our products 
in addition  to the extent the rules apply to us  we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements  including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products 
since our supply chain is complex  we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the diligence procedures that we implement  which may harm our reputation 

table of contents in such event  we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free 
we may incur additional healthcare costs arising from federal healthcare reform legislation 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of were signed into law in the us this legislation extends health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured 
the changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional healthcare and other costs 
risk factors related to our liquidity and capital resources volatility and uncertainty of the credit markets may negatively impact us 
we intend to finance our existing operations and initiatives with existing cash and cash equivalents  investments  cash flows from operations and potential borrowings under our revolving credit facility entered into on february  if adverse national and international economic conditions continue or deteriorate further  it is possible that we may not be able to fully draw upon our revolving credit facility and we may not be able to obtain new financing on favorable terms 
in addition  deterioration in the credit markets could adversely affect the ability of many of our customers to pay us on time and the ability of many of our suppliers to meet our needs on a competitive basis 
if we cannot access necessary additional funds on acceptable terms  our business and operations may be negatively impacted 
our inability to obtain adequate surety bonding or letters of credit could reduce our ability to bid on new work  which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and business prospects 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to customers and may be required to provide letters of credit 
these bonds and letters of credit provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if security is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain a bond or letter of credit on terms commercially acceptable to us  we may not be able to pursue that project 
in addition  bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost as a result of general conditions that affect the insurance and bonding markets 
surety bonds and letters of credit may cease to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
the limitations and covenants contained in our revolving credit facility could constrain our ability to borrow additional money  sell assets and make acquisitions 
compliance with these restrictions and covenants may limit our ability to fully implement elements of our business strategy 
our revolving credit facility contains a number of limitations and covenants that could limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to borrow money or make capital expenditures  incur liens  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  merge or sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  and make acquisitions 
in addition  our revolving credit facility contains other covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios  including total leverage and interest coverage 

table of contents if we are unable to remain in compliance with our financial covenants currently in effect under our revolving credit facility or obtain additional amendments or waivers from our lenders  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures and business acquisitions  restructure or refinance our indebtedness  decline certain business opportunities from customers or seek additional capital 
if we were required to write down our goodwill or other indefinite lived long term assets  our results of operations and stockholders equity could be materially adversely affected 
we have approximately million of goodwill and indefinite lived long term assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we are required to review goodwill and indefinite lived long term assets for impairment at least annually in accordance generally accepted accounting principles in the us if our results of operations decline  an impairment may be triggered 
if we were required to write down our goodwill or long lived assets  our results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates and from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
portions of our operations are located in foreign jurisdictions and a portion of our billings is paid in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets could therefore cause fluctuations in revenue derived from foreign operations 
for example  a decrease in the value against the us dollar of the foreign currency we receive for a project as to which a significant portion of our costs are incurred in us dollars would adversely affect our revenue  as expressed in us dollars  and our net income from that project 
in addition  sales of products and services are affected by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
changes in foreign currency rates can also affect the costs of our products purchased or manufactured outside the us changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
risk factors related to our common stock our common stock  which is listed on the nasdaq stock market  may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations and our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid 
the market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control  including the following the risk factors described in this item a  the significant concentration of ownership of our common stock in the hands of a small number of institutional investors  a shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry  general conditions in our customers industries  and general conditions in the security markets 
some companies that have volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to security class action suits filed against them 
if a suit were to be filed against us  regardless of the outcome  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise  either by us  a member of management or a major stockholder  or the perception that these sales could occur  could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
the limited liquidity for our common stock could affect your ability to sell your shares at a satisfactory price 
our common stock is relatively illiquid 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
the average daily trading volume in our common stock  as reported by the nasdaq global select market  for the trading days ending on december  was less than  shares 
a more active public market for our common stock may not develop  which could adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock 
moreover  a thin trading market for our stock could cause the market price for our common stock to fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole 
without a larger float  our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and  as a result  the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile 
in addition  in the absence of an active public trading market  stockholders may be unable to liquidate your shares of our common stock at a satisfactory price 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock 
on may   our board of directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we would pay quarterly dividends on our common stock and authorized the repurchase of up to two million shares of our common stock 
whether we continue these programs and the amount and timing of such dividends and or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends and or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and agreements of the company applicable to the declarations and payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of stock 
future dividends and stock repurchases  their timing and amount  as well as the relative allocation of cash between dividends and stock repurchases  may be affected by  among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for organic initiatives and strategic transactions  including acquisitions  debt service requirements  our credit rating  changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws  and changes to our business model 
in addition  the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors  including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from purchasing shares 
our dividend payments and or stock repurchases may change from time to time  and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all 
a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price

industry trends and outlook products division 
demand for our product lines has historically fluctuated with industrial demand for new power generating capacity and energy infrastructure 
our products are sold globally and there is generally about nine to months from when the order is booked until it is shipped for our braden business unit and the production cycle is generally four months or less for our consolidated fabricators  tog and koontz wagner business units 
demand for our products is based on worldwide economic growth and long term views regarding natural gas as an energy source 
with forecasted long term growth in global energy demand and an increased focus on shale gas development in north america and other markets  we believe that demand for gas fired power generation plants is likely to strengthen over time due to their relatively quick construction times  low capital costs and low carbon emissions as compared to other forms of fossil fueled power plants 
while renewable energy sources could reduce future gas fired power additions  we believe gas fired power generation is likely to continue to be the preferred choice for stand by capacity to complement intermittent forms of renewable energy 
we also believe that renewable energy sources have a higher cost when compared to traditional forms of power generation 
economic recovery has typically been accompanied by a rise in commodity prices 
we expect the demand for power generating capacity additions in certain emerging markets will out pace growth in developed markets over the near term 
in regions where natural gas is plentiful  we expect that gas fired power generation is likely to be the preferred fuel source for baseload power 
various developed and emerging markets are making capital investments in natural gas pipelines and related infrastructure 
these investments could contribute to more stabilized natural gas pricing which is generally favorable to the gas fired power generation market as a whole 
us and international markets have been slow to recover since the global financial crisis that began in growth of the world economy has weakened during  and is expected to remain subdued in during the first half of  we saw increases in certain markets  led by the middle east and the us however  new orders in the second half of slowed considerably in response to a slowing recovery in the us  a prolonged recovery in europe  and slowing growth in the global economy 
continued political and social unrest in the middle east and north africa could result in supply disruptions  order delays or both  which could adversely affect our financial results 
within europe  we expect demand for new power projects to remain low principally as a result of the european sovereign debt crisis which may also impact global infrastructure investment 
while we believe that our contract terms  procurement procedures and global customer base make it less likely that a change in foreign currency rates could have a significant impact on operating results  there remains significant uncertainty regarding the euro in should the european economic or sovereign debt crisis result in heightened volatility  our results of operations could be affected 
our overall long term outlook remains positive as demand increases for global power generation capacity additions  but has been affected by short term headwinds resulting from continued macro economic uncertainties and a slowing global recovery 
natural gas power generation remains a less expensive and a lower emission alternative to coal fired power generation  and we are in a strong position to take advantage of this once a sustainable recovery takes hold for utility scale turbine projects 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we expanded our oem offerings with the acquisition of koontz wagner and our repair and replacement parts product line with the acquisition of tog 
these acquisitions allow us to broaden our product and service offerings to the power generation market as well as to expand into the oil and gas pipeline infrastructure market 
currently  orders from the oil and gas pipeline infrastructure market are robust and we anticipate this market to be a source of revenue growth in for our business 
we expect our products division revenue in to remain flat with as the increase in revenue from our new koontz wagner and tog businesses will offset a decline in our braden business 
we expect the near term market to be challenging due to a limited number of new gas turbine installations putting pressure on gross margins in services division 
demand for plant upgrades  modification and maintenance services in the us has been positively impacted by the aging infrastructure of nuclear power generation facilities and the tendency of plant owners electing to outsource these services as a means of reducing fixed costs 
our level of plant modification and maintenance work performed at nuclear power plants trended downward in and is expected to return to normalized levels in with period to period fluctuations resulting from the timing of particular outages within our customer base 
within our modification and maintenance services  our customers have experienced lower demand for power as a result of current economic conditions and the mild winter in our customers are also experiencing increased competition due to low natural gas prices 
as a result  some of our customers reduced the scope of elective maintenance projects 
capital spending constraints and deferred maintenance requirements negatively impacted revenues in but we expect an increased volume of bid activity in in addition to our traditional modification and maintenance services  we are seeking to align with complementary service providers to provide turn key epc services for larger capital and maintenance projects 
we see this alignment as an area of continued future growth that would allow us to reach new customers and markets and would provide cyclical offsets to the timing of refueling outages in our traditional modification and maintenance business 
we also expanded our service offerings with other complementary offerings including valve maintenance and repair services and unique coating applications that enhance the value of the coatings to allow customers to obtain a longer coating life 
while we provide most of our specialty services as an addendum to our traditional modification and maintenance services at power plants  we also service customers in other segments of the market including pulp and paper and conventional power 
as a result of economic conditions in those segments  the growth opportunities for our specialty services are focused on niche service offerings  typically within our existing customer base 
we participated in all of the us new and re start nuclear plant projects in our performance in has positioned us to increase our level of participation in we also made investments through workforce additions in to position us for additional nuclear work as well as expand our end markets 
these investments increased our operating costs slightly in  but will provide resources that will develop opportunities for long term growth 
in connection with the fukushima  japan incident in march  the nrc has issued preliminary guidance related to certain modifications on the us nuclear fleet  but the timing and scope of such modifications remain uncertain as us utilities evaluate how these preliminary guidelines will apply to their nuclear sites 
we do anticipate some projects to begin to materialize by the second half of from this guidance 
our overall long term outlook remains positive as we believe the us nuclear industry will continue to utilize third party contractors to service the aging infrastructure under an increasing regulatory environment that drives baseline maintenance and capital investments 
executing our business strategy and other costs 
as we seek to execute our business strategy we anticipate an increase in selling and administrative expenses as we invest in technologies and develop our team 
in addition  
table of contents the potential effects of implementing and compliance with the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of act on our selling and administrative expenses are uncertain 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included under page f of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
we are organized in two reportable segments  the products division and the services division 
substantially all of our revenue within the products division are derived from fixed priced contracts 
within the services division  we enter into a variety of contract structures including cost plus reimbursements  time and material contracts and fixed price contracts 
the determination of the contract structure within the services division is based on the scope of work  complexity and project length and customer preference and contract terms 
we expense pre contract costs as incurred 
change orders are included in total estimated contract revenue when they can be reliably estimated and it is probable that the change order will be approved by the customer or realized 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
in our products division  revenue for gas turbine auxiliary and control house equipment is recognized on the completed contract method  typically when the unit is delivered and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
revenue for the selective catalytic emission reduction scr product line in the products division and the fixed price contracts in the services division are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract since management has the ability to produce reasonably dependable estimates of contract billings and contract costs 
we use the level of profit margin that is most likely to occur on a contract 
if the most likely profit margin cannot be precisely determined  the lowest probable level of profit in the range of estimates is used until the results can be estimated more precisely 
our estimate of the total contract costs to be incurred at any particular time has a significant impact on the revenue recognized for the respective period 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability  final contract settlements and resolution of claims may result in revisions to costs and income  and the effects of such revisions are recognized in the period that the revisions are determined 
estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which they first become apparent 
under percentage of completion accounting  management must also make key judgments in areas such as the percentage of completion  estimates of project revenue  costs and margin  estimates of total and remaining project hours and liquidated damages assessments 
any deviations from estimates could have a significant positive or negative impact on our results of operations 
products division revenue for gas turbine auxiliary and control house equipment is recognized on the completed contract method  typically when the unit is shipped 
certain of these contracts specify separate delivery dates of 
table of contents individual equipment units or require customer acceptance of a product 
in circumstances where separate delivery dates of individual equipment units exist  we recognize revenue when the customer assumes the risk of loss and title for the equipment  which is generally the date the unit is shipped  and corresponding costs previously deferred are charged to expense 
in circumstances where the contract requires customer acceptance of a product in addition to transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer  revenue is either recognized i upon shipment when we are able to demonstrate that the customer specific objective criteria have been met or ii upon customer acceptance 
once title and risk of loss have transferred and  where applicable  customer acceptance is complete  we have no further performance obligations 
our scr product line follows percentage of completion method based on cost to cost input measures 
regardless of contract provisions  we require that the customer assumes risk of loss and title  and the installation is operating according to specifications or is an uninstalled unit that has been accepted by the customer for revenue to be recognized 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability  final contract settlements and resolution of claims may result in revisions to job costs and income amounts that are different than amounts originally estimated 
cost plus and time and material contracts represent the majority of the contracts in the service division 
for these contract types  we recognize revenue when services are performed based upon an agreed upon price for the completed services or based upon the hours incurred and agreed upon hourly rates 
some of our contracts include provisions that adjust contract revenue for safety  schedule or other performance measures 
on cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and includes applicable mark up earned through the date services are provided 
fixed price contracts are recognized under the percentage of completion method using cost to cost measures 
we may incur costs subject to change orders  whether approved or unapproved by the customer  and or claims related to certain contracts 
we determine the probability that such costs will be recovered based upon evidence such as past practices with the customer  specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or verbal approvals 
we treat items as a cost of contract performance in the period incurred and will recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated 
revenue and cost of revenue for the discontinued deltak business unit were recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of actual hours incurred to date in relation to total estimated hours for each contract 
this method was used because management considered expended labor hours to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
long lived assets 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc subsequent measurement impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we group long lived assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable according to asc impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if circumstances require a long lived asset be tested for possible impairment  we first compare undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to the carrying value of the asset 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values and third party independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
we have determined that no events or change in circumstances have occurred that indicate that the carrying amount of any of our long lived assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill  we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change to suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on the testing of goodwill impairment giving entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment before having to calculate the fair 
table of contents value of a reporting unit  however  we did not choose the qualitative assessment only option 
consequently  we executed a quantitative based impairment test as of december  during  and  we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill and concluded that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the related carrying value and therefore no impairment was recorded 
we also assess goodwill at the end of a quarter if a triggering event occurs 
in determining whether an interim triggering event has occurred  management monitors i the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test and ii significant changes to future expectations 
in connection with the acquisitions  we increased the products division goodwill by million 
in connection with the sale of the deltak business unit in  we reduced the products division goodwill by million on august  and performed an assessment as of the transaction date of the reporting unit affected and concluded that the estimated fair value of the affected reporting unit substantially exceeded the related carrying value and therefore no impairment was recorded 
we estimate a portion of the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach by utilizing a discounted cash flow model based on several factors including balance sheet carrying values  historical results  our most recent forecasts  and other relevant quantitative and qualitative information 
we discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital at the date of evaluation 
we also use the market approach to estimate the remaining portion of our reporting unit valuation 
this technique utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate 
while the income approach has the advantage of utilizing more company specific information  the market approach has the advantage of capturing market based transaction pricing 
preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments that we base primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  and general market conditions 
significant changes in these forecasts  the discount rate selected  or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
the combined estimated fair value of all of our reporting units from the weighted total of the market approach and income approach often results in a premium over our market capitalization  commonly referred to as a control premium 
the calculated control premium percentage is evaluated and compared to an estimated acceptable midpoint percentage 
in the event that the calculated control premium is above this midpoint  a portion of the excess control premium is allocated to reduce the fair value of each reporting unit in order to further assess whether any reporting units have incurred goodwill impairment 
assessing the acceptable control premium percentage requires judgment and is impacted by external factors such as observed control premiums from comparable transactions derived from the prices paid on recent publicly disclosed acquisitions in our industry 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize in income the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date 
under asc income taxes asc  fasb requires companies to assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence  and utilizing a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous operating history are given more weight than its future outlook  although we do consider future taxable income projections  ongoing tax planning strategies and the limitation on the use of carryforward losses in determining valuation allowance needs 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we did not place valuation allowances against foreign tax credits generated in in accordance with asc based on the company s future strategy  its recent utilization of net operating loss nol carryforwards  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical operating income  projected future taxable income  and projected foreign source income  it is reasonably possible that certain foreign tax credit valuation allowances may be released in the near term in accordance with asc the potential range of foreign tax credit valuation allowance releases are projected to be between and million 
we recognized future cash tax benefits in the fourth quarter of of million related to the increase of deferred tax assets 
we also recognized non recurring  non cash tax benefits in the fourth quarter of of million related to the release of asc liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of december  in the second quarter of  we significantly reduced our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for intangible assets  accruals and us nol carryforwards in accordance with asc management s assessment in and included consideration of all available positive and negative evidence including  among other evidence  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carry back and carry forward periods  recent utilization of nol carryforwards  historical operating income  projected future taxable income  including foreign source income  customer concentration  tight credit markets  and tax planning strategies 
based on the weight of the available evidence  we determined that it was more likely than not that the us and foreign nol carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards generated during were realizable based on the guidance provided in asc based on expectations of taxable income  foreign source income and the ten year carryforward  foreign tax credits generated in are expected to be realized and did not require a valuation allowance 
because the us nol carryforwards were expected to be realized due to and future year s income  only the portion attributable to future year s income was released as a discrete event during the second quarter of the remainder was allocated to subsequent interim periods in as income was realized and would have adjusted the estimated annual effective tax rate 
we recognized a non recurring  non cash tax benefit in the second quarter of for continuing operations of million related to the release of valuation allowances as of june  our income allowed interim period decreases to the valuation allowance of million and million for third quarter and fourth quarter of  respectively 
additionally  there were partially offsetting increases to valuation allowances in the second and fourth quarters of of million and million  respectively  for state nol modifications 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined it was more likely than not that a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards were realizable and released the valuation allowance recorded against the portion of foreign tax credit carryforwards deemed realizable 
accordingly  we recognized a non recurring  non cash tax benefit at december  of million related to the partial release of the valuation allowance in regards to foreign tax credit carryforwards 
we continue to record valuation allowances against a portion of foreign tax credit carryforwards and certain state nol carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that taxable income of the appropriate character will not be recognized in the appropriate jurisdictions before the carryforwards expire 
as of december   we have valuation allowances of million and million recorded against foreign tax credit carryforwards and state nol carryforwards  respectively 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we believe that our benefits and accruals recognized are appropriate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretation of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is determined to be different than the amounts recorded  those differences will impact income tax 
table of contents expense in the period in which the determination is made 
we anticipate we will release million of accruals of uncertain tax positions as the statute of limitations related to these liabilities will lapse in warranty costs 
we estimate warranty costs based on past warranty claims  specific identification method  sales history and applicable contract terms 
our warranty terms vary by contract but generally extend for no more than three years after delivery or completion of services 
we manage our exposure to warranty claims by having our field service and quality assurance personnel regularly monitor projects and maintain ongoing and regular communications with our customers 
insurance 
we self insure a portion of our risk for health benefits and workers compensation 
we maintain insurance coverage for other business risks including general liability insurance 
we retain exposure to potential losses based on deductibles  coverage limits  and self insured retentions 
we charged approximately million  million and million to expense during the years ended december   and  respectively  with respect to health benefits  general liability and workers compensation claims incurred and related insurance premiums for excess claim coverage for continuing operations 
our reserves as of december  and consisted of estimated amounts unpaid for reported and unreported claims incurred 
our accrual for all self insured risk retention as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding as security for possible workers compensation claims 
recent accounting guidance 
for a discussion of recent accounting guidance and the expected impact that the guidance could have on our consolidated financial statements  see note summary of significant accounting policies included in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
year results selected financial and operating data for our reportable business segments for the most recent three years is summarized below 
this information  as well as the selected financial data provided in item and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k  should be referred to when reading our discussion and analysis of results of operations below 

table of contents our summary financial results during the years ended  and are as follows in thousands years ended december  products revenue services revenue total revenue cost of products revenue cost of services revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling and administrative expenses reorganization expense income operating income interest expense  net other expense income  net income from continuing operations before income tax income tax expense benefit income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax loss gain on disposal  net of tax income from discontinued operations net income products operating results for our products division reflect higher shipment volumes for our braden and consolidated fabricators business units compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased activity in the middle east and the us gross margins realized during the year ended december  were materially similar to those realized in during  we also expanded our oem offerings with the acquisition of koontz wagner and our repair and replacement parts product line with the acquisition of tog  both acquisitions closed during the third quarter of services volumes in our services division depend in significant part upon our customers scheduling of refueling outages and timing of capital project work  which historically has varied from year to year and within each calendar year 
as a result  the volume of outage work in any calendar year may vary as compared to prior years and during the course of the year as projects are commenced and completed 
during  we experienced a reduction in refueling outage work at nuclear power plants as a result of capital spending constraints and deferred maintenance requirements in response to lower electricity demand and two consecutive mild winters in and offsetting the reduction in refueling outage work was a higher level of capital project work compared to related to our participation on new build and re start nuclear project sites in the us our margins realized during have improved from due to operational execution and efficient project management on capital projects 

table of contents backlog our backlog consists of firm orders or blanket authorizations from our customers 
backlog may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period due to the timing of customer commitments 
the time between receipt of an order and actual completion  or delivery  of our products varies from a few weeks  in the case of inventoried precision parts  to a year or more  in the case of custom designed gas turbine auxiliary equipment  scr system and other major plant components 
we add a booking to our backlog for products division orders when we receive a purchase order or other written contractual commitment from a customer 
we reduce products division backlog as revenue is recognized  or upon cancellation 
the maintenance services we provide through our services division are typically carried out under long term contracts spanning several years 
upon signing a multi year maintenance contract with a customer for services  we add to our backlog only the first twelve months of work that we expect to perform under the contract 
additional work that is not identified under the original contract is added to our backlog when we reach an agreement with the customer as to the scope and pricing of that additional work 
capital project awards are typically defined in terms of scope and pricing at the time of contractual commitment from the customer 
upon receipt of a customer commitment  capital project bookings are added to our backlog at full contract value regardless of the time frame anticipated to complete the project 
maintenance services and capital project bookings are removed from our backlog as work is performed and revenue is recognized  or upon cancellation 
backlog is not a measure defined by generally accepted accounting principles  and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog amounts 
backlog may not be indicative of future operating results and projects in our backlog may be cancelled  modified or otherwise altered by our customers 
the following table shows our backlog  by segment  as of december   and in thousands backlog as of december  products backlog services backlog total our products division backlog as of december  decreased from december  by million 
included in our products division backlog as of december  was million related to the acquisitions 
excluding the acquisitions  products division backlog decreased by million from december  this decrease was primarily driven by heavy volume shipments during the fourth quarter outpacing new orders 
proposal activity is robust for oil and gas pipeline infrastructure projects  and power generation project proposals remain steady with a heavier mix expected to ship in or later 
excluding the effects of the acquisitions  the ratio of orders booked to orders shipped was to during the year ended december  our services division backlog as of december  increased from december  by million 
the increase in backlog from december  was primarily due to the renewal of a multi year maintenance and modification contract as well as scope expansion on multi year new build and re start nuclear project sites 
the build in backlog from new project bookings more than offset the impact of lower backlog from our core maintenance and modification services due to customer budget constraints 
of the million in services division backlog as of december   we expect an estimated million to convert to revenue beyond the ratio of project awards added to backlog to services rendered was to during the year ended december  
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue in thousands variance products revenue services revenue total products revenue 
the composition of our products division revenue varies from period to period based on our product mix  the strength of various geographic markets we serve and our ability to address those markets 
the geographic dispersion of where products were shipped during the years ended and was as follows in thousands variance united states canada europe mexico asia middle east south america other total the million or increase in products division revenue during the year ended december   compared to the corresponding period in  was primarily due to increased shipments to the middle east and the us and incremental revenue of million associated with the acquisitions as compared to the year ended december  project shipments delayed by customer requests during the first half of shipped in the second half of project delivery dates often change after a project is added to our backlog due to project site logistics or customer driven change orders among other reasons including transportation logistics 
services revenue 
the decrease in services division revenue of million or during the year ended december   was primarily due to an approximate million in net revenue reduction from outage work in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decline in outage work was primarily related to two fewer planned outages in as compared to as well as decreases in scope due to deferred maintenance and customer spending constraints 
in addition  million in revenue recognized in was attributable to a contract that has since expired 
the impact of these volume reductions was partially offset by approximately million from increased construction support work at new build and re start nuclear reactor sites and approximately million of increased capital project work 

table of contents gross profit margin in thousands variance gross profit products gross margin gross profit services gross margin total gross profit gross margin products 
the increase in products division gross profit during the year ended december  of million compared to the corresponding period in  was primarily due to increases in revenue associated with higher shipment volumes  which impacted gross profit dollars by approximately million 
in addition  the acquisitions favorably impacted gross profit dollars by approximately million 
the effect of the volume increase was partially offset by a decrease in realized gross margin percentage 
contributing to the decrease in gross margin percentage were increased warranty costs of million and unfavorable absorption of million related to expansion for our parts manufacturing capacity 
services 
the decrease in services division gross profit during the year ended december  of million compared to the corresponding period in  was primarily due to the decrease in revenue  which impacted gross profit dollars by approximately million 
the effect of the volume reduction was partially offset by an increase in gross margin percentage primarily due to million related to improved operational execution  efficient project management on capital projects in and a million favorable insurance retention reserve adjustment based on an updated actuarial estimate due to continued improvements in our safety record

our ability to access the maximum amount of availability is dependent upon certain conditions as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement 
cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility represent our primary sources of short term liquidity 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and our available borrowings will be adequate to satisfy our working capital needs  general corporate purposes  capital expenditures  interest payments on our unused borrowing capacity  common stock repurchases  dividends on our common stock and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations over the next months

included in our total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was approximately million maintained in our non us operations and subsidiaries 
in general  these resources are not available to fund our us operations unless the funds are repatriated to the us  which would expose us to taxes we presently have not accrued in our results of operations 
we presently have no plans to repatriate these funds to the us as we believe the liquidity generated by our us operations and our unused borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of our us operations 
the primary elements of our working capital accounts are accounts receivable  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  other assets  accounts payable  billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and other accrued liabilities 
we continually monitor our accounts receivable and manage our operating cash flows by managing the working capital accounts in total  rather than by the individual elements 
this comprehensive view of working capital  taking into account each of the six primary elements listed  is both common and useful in our project based industry  as it facilitates reviews of cash flow information at the total working capital level 
our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
we cannot be assured that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings in addition to our revolving credit facility will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing above our revolving credit facility will continue to be available in the future or that it will be available under terms acceptable to us 
failure to obtain sufficient capital could materially hinder our future expansion strategies

the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
we may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and or equity issuances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
we have established policies to monitor and control these market risks 
foreign exchange rate risk 
we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have from time to time used derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency transactions 
we did not enter into any such instruments as of or during the year ended december  we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure is volatility of interest rates  primarily in the us we manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swap agreements 
we are subject to interest rate changes on our libor based variable interest rate under our revolving credit facility
