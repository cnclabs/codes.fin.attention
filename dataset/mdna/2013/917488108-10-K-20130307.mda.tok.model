item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations currency amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
overview in  sales  gross profits  operating profits  net income and earnings per share were substantially higher compared to on march   utmd acquired femcare see note 
the comparison between and is affected by the fact that results only include the business activity of femcare group ltd after march  change net sales gross profit operating income income before tax net income earnings per share a comparison of profit margins in to follows gross profit margin operating income margin net income margin the company s continued excellent profitability in allowed it to pay down the five year term loans that it incurred to finance the purchase of femcare group ltd in march faster than required  while retaining utmd s programs of dividend payments to its shareholders and share repurchases 
with regard to utmd s four product categories  sales in gynecology urology products was its highest category in both and in  gynecology urology  neonatal  blood pressure monitoring accessories and labor delivery device sales were    and of total sales  respectively 
in  the same product categories were   and of total sales  respectively 
simply stated  with the acquisition of femcare  utmd is now much more a gynecology medical device company 
the company s new product development activities will reflect that change in emphasis 
the improvement in gross profit margin gpm and operating profit margin opm in was due to realization of operating synergies from the femcare acquisition 
the gpm benefited from direct sales in ireland and the uk of utah devices which were previously sold through distributors  from better utilization of manufacturing capabilities in ireland due to pulling in work previously subcontracted out to third parties by femcare and from a more favorable product mix over a full year compared to of the prior year 
the higher opm in was due to higher gpm  lack of acquisition expenses experienced in the prior year  improved productivity of s m and g a resources  and a dilution of foreign subsidiary operating expenses when consolidating into us dollar usd terms as a result of a stronger usd 
utmd s net income margin nim was up due to the higher opm  lower interest expense resulting from lower loan balances and a lower income tax provision 
the effective consolidated income tax provision rate for was three percentage points lower than in due to a lower corporate income tax rate in the uk  a higher portion of pretax income in the lower taxed sovereignties of ireland and the uk and a favorable income tax accrual adjustment in ireland 
earnings per share eps of were slightly more diluted than in by the exercise of employee options 
the number of diluted shares for calculating eps were up from over the years  utmd has been able to effectively offset dilution from its option plans  which were approved by shareholders  by its share repurchase program  which remains utmd s objective going forward 
there were a few significant changes in utmd s balance sheet at december  from december  current assets increased million cash investments increased million  while inventories decreased million  current liabilities decreased million and notes payable declined million 
shareholders equity increased million net of cash dividends paid to shareholders of million and share repurchases of million 
measures of the company s liquidity and overall financial condition improved in as utmd reduced its debt 
utmd s current ratio current assets to current liabilities increased to at the end of from a year earlier  and the total debt ratio total liabilities to total assets declined to from at the end of cash generation remained strong enough to increase quarterly cash dividend payout rate to shareholders by and repurchase  shares while at the same time paying down the loan principal balances more rapidly than required 
ending days in accounts receivable improved to from inventory balances were lower at year end than at the end of the return on average shareholders equity prior to the payment of dividends increased to in compared to for productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year end total assets were  compared to  at the end of current assets increased  due to a  increase in cash  offset by decreases in receivables and inventories 
the two components of femcare intangibles at year end were identifiable intangibles of  reduced from  on march  by accumulated amortization of  and goodwill of  the productivity of total assets average total asset turns total sales divided by average total assets for the year in was compared to in the decline was due to the increase in assets from the femcare acquisition for only a portion of property  plant and equipment pp e assets are comprised of utah  ireland and england manufacturing molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software  and facilities 
ending net consolidated pp e depreciated book value of all fixed assets decreased as a result of in depreciation  capital expenditures of and the year end effect of usd currency exchange rates on the value of pp e in england and ireland 
the net book value of pp e in the us decreased during  and in ireland decreased femcare s ending net book value of pp e was after depreciation of average pp e turns sales divided by net pp e increased about because sales increased and year end net pp e decreased 
in contrast to utmd  femcare leases its facilities and subcontracts most of its manufacturing 
the year end net book value after accumulated depreciation of consolidated pp e was of actual acquisition cost 
since utmd s pp e is in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity  the continued productivity of fixed assets will remain a source of future profitability 
in  the utah facility was expanded to consolidate oregon operations 
in  new pp e purchases are not expected to exceed depreciation of fixed assets 
year end inventories decreased from the beginning of the year 
average inventory turns were compared to in despite lower inventories at the end of  because the beginning inventory balance did not include femcare 
net after allowance for doubtful accounts year end trade accounts receivable a r balances decreased due to collection of slow paying international accounts 
average days in a r on december  of days  based on q shipments  was down from days at the end of this performance remained well within management s continuing trade a r objective of days 
the company believes any older a r will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end compared to the end of  year end current assets increased  and year end current liabilities decreased  this had a leveraged effect on the current ratio  which improved to from at the end of the increase in current assets resulted from a  increase in cash 
year end and cash and investment balances were  and  representing and of total assets  respectively 
the end of working capital amount exceeds utmd s needs for managing normal operations  meeting current interest and debt repayment obligations  and paying shareholder dividends 
it is also sufficient for periodically repurchasing enough shares to offset dilution from employee and director options and internally financing organic growth 
if  however  utmd has the opportunity for another major accretive acquisition  current working capital might not be sufficient 
utmd paid a net  for femcare in march the remaining principal balance of the loans incurred to help purchase femcare as of december  using the year end gbp to usd conversion rate is  because the remaining femcare loan payments are fixed and cannot be paid early without penalty  utmd expects to use just  to reduce loan balances in  following use of  in and  in even after continued shareholder dividend payments  utmd anticipates increasing cash balances during  unless another acquisition  or unusual investment in pp e or technology  or significant share repurchase opportunities occur 
without currently identified opportunities for significant uses of cash  utmd s current ratio at the end of will be higher than at the end of net intangible assets were  at the end of compared to  at the end of net intangible assets after accumulated amortization are comprised of the capitalized costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property including technology rights  and identifiable intangibles and goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
the femcare intangible assets purchased by utmd in are described in note utmd s goodwill balance was  at the end of under current us gaap  goodwill is not expensed unless and until the market value of the acquired entity becomes impaired 
the three prior acquisitions of  and continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business 
utmd does not expect the current goodwill value associated with the four acquisitions including femcare to become impaired in purchases of intangibles in were  while there was  in amortization expense 
the non cash amortization expense of femcare identifiable intangible assets was  the non cash amortization expense of femcare identifiable intangible assets will be about  depending on the usd gbp exchange rate on  of expense 
net intangible assets at the end of represented of total assets  compared to at the end of b liabilities 
at the end of  utmd s total liabilities decreased  from the end of the resulting year end total debt ratio was  compared to at the end of total liabilities decreased primarily because of repayment of the term loans which had a year end balance of  that utmd obtained to help finance the femcare acquisition in the deferred tax liability created as a result of the fifteen year tax consequence of the amortization of the femcare identifiable intangible assets had a year end balance of  down from  a year earlier 
the ireland subsidiary debt was fully retired during from a loan balance of at the end of the femcare uk loan declined  in book value  compared to principal payments of  in great britain pound gbp terms  the note declined from  at the end of to  at the end of the differences between the decline in the period end balances and the principal payments during the year resulted from timing of currency exchange rates applied to balance sheet balances 
principal payments on the femcare us loan were  as the note declined from  at the end of to  at the end of utmd has now repaid the entire variable interest rate portion of the usd note  and anticipates repaying the remaining gbp and usd balances ratably over the remaining life to march year end consolidated current liabilities were  lower than at year end as a result of paying off the variable interest rate portion of the usd loan  which reduced the current portion of the loan by  and from paying a portion of accrued management bonuses in december instead of in january in addition to liabilities stated on the balance sheet  utmd has operating lease and purchase obligations described in note results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales in were  compared to  in and  in the company believes that revenue should be recognized at the time of shipment as title generally passes to the customer at the time of shipment  or completion of services performed under contract 
revenue recognized by utmd is based upon documented arrangements and fixed contracts in which the selling price is fixed prior to acceptance and completion of an order 
revenue from product or service sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped or service completed and invoiced  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
there are no post shipment obligations which have been or are expected to be material to financial results 
there are circumstances under which revenue may be recognized when product is not shipped  which meet the criteria of sab the company provides engineering services  for example  design and production of manufacturing tooling that may be used in subsequent utmd manufacturing of custom components for other companies 
this revenue is recognized when utmd s service has been completed according to a fixed contractual agreement 
terms of sale are established in advance of utmd s acceptance of customer orders 
in the us  ireland  uk and australia  utmd generally accepts orders directly from and ships directly to end user clinical facilities  as well as third party med surg distributors  under utmd s standard terms and conditions t c of sale 
about of utmd s domestic end user sales go through third party med surg distributors which contract separately with clinical facilities to provide purchasing  storage and scheduled delivery functions for the applicable facility 
utmd s t c of sale are substantially the same in the us  ireland  uk and australia 
utmd may have separate discounted pricing agreements with a clinical facility or group of affiliated facilities based on volume of purchases 
pricing agreements with clinical facilities  or groups of affiliated facilities  if applicable  are established in advance of orders accepted or shipments made 
for existing customers  past actual shipment volumes determine the fixed price by part number for the next agreement period of one  two or three years 
for new customers  the customer s best estimate of volume is accepted by utmd for determining the ensuing fixed prices for the agreement period 
new customers typically have one year agreements 
prices are not adjusted after an order is accepted 
for the sake of clarity  the separate pricing agreements with clinical facilities based on volume of purchases disclosure is not inconsistent with utmd s disclosure above that the selling price is fixed prior to the acceptance of a specific customer order 
utmd may from time to time establish a similar fixed price agreement with a group purchasing organization gpo in the us gpos are bargaining agents for member hospitals  not customers of utmd 
except for an administrative fee  generally of utmd s sales to a gpo s members  the t c of gpo agreements are not materially different from utmd s standard t c of sale 
total global consolidated sales in were up  or from consolidated sales were   and  in calendar years  and  respectively 
domestic sales were  in  compared to  in and  in the increase in was due to a million increase in filshie clip system sales to cooper surgical  inc coo 
the increase resulted from the fact that sales to coo were only for the part of following the march femcare acquisition 
in  total sales to coo were  or of total sales 
coo has forecasted its purchases from utmd in will be about lower than in  with the difference all in the first quarter of international foreign sales in were  compared to  in and  in international sales were of global consolidated sales in  in and in in addition to the benefit of a higher sales volume to absorb the overhead costs of its critical infrastructure  a significant benefit of the femcare acquisition for utmd was the geographic diversification of sales outside the us utmd sold devices to international distributors in in addition to a greater number of overseas sales distribution entities  utmd plans to continue to better cross utilize distributors previously representing one or the other of femcare or utmd  but this integration project continues somewhat slowly as distributors evaluate and learn about the other specialized product lines relative to their individual market needs  and utmd adjusts its distribution agreements 
as a measure of better utilization of existing distributors  in utmd sold more than  worth of devices to international distributors compared to in of the international sales  were to customers in europe compared to in and in femcare shipped of utmd s total international sales in both and utmd s ireland subsidiary utmd ltd 
shipped of total international sales in usd terms in  compared to in and in while the standard of living in the us continues to decline and government intervention in the us health care market continues to increase  utmd expects growth in its international sales will continue to outpace domestic sales growth 
utmd groups its sales into four general product categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease including letz  endometrial tissue sampling  transvaginal uterine sonography  diagnostic laparoscopy  surgical contraception and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal critical care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies  including providing vascular access  enteral feeding  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components as well as molded parts and assemblies sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors enjoy a significant market share and may have differentiated product features protected by patents 
global revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
international revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
as a summary description of revenues in the above tables obstetrics 
the decline in total obstetrics l d device sales in was the result of lower utilization of specialty devices in us hospitals together with restrictive us gpo administrative agreements 
us domestic obstetric product sales declined 
international obstetric device sales decreased due to overstocking by a few international distributors in the gynecology electrosurgery urology es gyn product category includes all of femcare s products 
es gyn sales in excluding femcare increased 
with femcare  es gyn sales increased 
domestic es gyn sales increased  while international es gyn sales increased 
the domestic sales increase was due to sales to cooper surgical inc  described above 
the es gyn international sales increase included direct sales in the uk and ireland at end user prices instead of distributor prices  as well as an unusual purchase of in electrosurgery equipment and supplies for a far east clinical customer 
neonatal intensive care unit nicu device sales decreased in the us and remained about the same internationally 
the us decline was consistent with utmd s experience described for the obstetrics product category 
blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm 
us domestic bpm sales increased  while international bpm sales increased 
this category includes molded components and assemblies some of which are not related to medical devices sold to other companies oem customers for use in their products 
the us increase was due to a increase in oem sales 
utmd s second largest customer in  beijing sak  purchased million of deltran blood pressure monitoring kits from utmd ltd ireland for use in china  compared to million in looking forward to  in addition to the lower coo forecast for its purchases of the filshie clip system for us distribution  utmd does not expect the far east electrosurgery supplies program purchase to repeat in  and anticipates that severely economically challenged us hospital purchases of specialty neonatal and l d devices may decline another offsetting the projected declines  utmd expects to continue obtaining benefits from its joint distribution rationalization program initiated after the acquisition of femcare in march  including selling devices directly in ireland  uk and australia at end user prices that were previously sold to distributors at wholesale prices 
if correct about the attractiveness of its new system  utmd expects to gain in finesse sales 
new distributors recruited in in emerging markets should add another in sales 
international bpm kit sales should continue to grow by perhaps  as china sak  utmd s largest bpm kit customer at  in  has committed to purchasing a comparable amount in finally  utmd expects that its us oem customer business which grew by in should increase another in netting the above together  excluding the possibility of an acquisition or successful introduction of not yet announced new products  utmd s best estimate for global consolidated sales is a decline of about  which is about equal to the projected decline in the coo forecast by itself 
b gross profit 
utmd s consolidated gross profit  the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacturing  including purchasing raw materials  forming components  assembling  inspecting  testing  packaging  sterilizing and shipping products  from net revenues  was  compared to  in and  in average gross profit margins gpms  gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales  were in compared to in and in despite increases in raw materials costs and unit labor costs in  utmd s gpm was percentage points higher in than in the improvement was due to a more favorable product mix over a full year compared to of the prior year  substantially better utilization of manufacturing direct labor and overhead costs in ireland  and better efficiencies in utah molding operations from providing a greater volume of molded part components both to intercompany as well as external oem customers 
the ireland subsidiary gpm is lower than the average consolidated utmd gpm because almost all of the finished devices sold by utmd ltd were to third party international distributors at discounted wholesale prices 
bpm devices themselves are generally commodities now  and the costs of manufacturing in ireland  in particular labor related costs  are higher than in utah 
ireland subsidiary gross profits in euros were in compared to in and in the associated gpms were in  in and in the higher gpm in was due the fact that sales increased while loaded direct labor increased and manufacturing overhead costs increased 
the gains in productivity in direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs were partially offset by marginally higher direct materials costs which increased 
the femcare group subsidiary gross profits in gbp were  compared to  in the associated gpms were in and in the decline was due primarily to higher direct materials costs 
going forward  utmd expects to realize a benefit from its own manufacturing quality and cost disciplines for certain femcare devices 
in particular  utmd will be able to increasingly employ its utah molding capabilities and ireland assembly and packaging operations 
in the us  gross profits were  in compared to  in and  in the associated gpms were in  in and in with lower sales in  utmd expects that its consolidated gross profits will be about lower as a result of increases in fixed labor and overhead costs absorbed by lower revenues  higher costs of employee benefits including medical plan costs and unemployment taxes  inflation in the cost of raw materials and a less favorable product mix than in as the company succeeds in bringing the manufacture of some femcare products in house  and continues to increase sales to end users rather than to distributors  it will help offset the unfavorable factors outlined above 
taking all factors together  utmd estimates that the net impact to its consolidated gpm in will be a reduction to about from in c operating income 
operating income is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  product development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
consolidated operating expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in the following table provides a comparison of operating expense categories for the last three years 
s m expenses r d expenses g a a litigation expense provision g a b corporate legal expenses g a c stock option compensation expense g a d management bonus accrual g a e outside accounting audit tax expenses g a f intangible asset amortization g a g acquisition expenses g a h all other g a expenses g a expenses total total operating expenses operating expenses of sales consolidated operating income in was  compared to  in and  in utmd s operating income margin oim  operating income divided by total sales  was in  compared to in and in the utmd ltd ireland subsidiary oim in was compared to in and in femcare s oim was compared to in utmd us oim in was compared to in and in looking forward to  utmd projects its consolidated oim will be about i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  attending clinical meetings and medical trade shows  administering customer agreements  advertising  processing orders  shipping  paying commissions to outside representatives and funding gpo fees 
in markets where utmd sells directly to end users  which in was the us  ireland  uk and australia  the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of employing direct sales representatives  including associated costs of travel  subsistence and communications 
the trade off between higher gross profit margins for selling directly at end user prices is higher s m expenses as a percent of sales 
this is reflected in the increase in s m expenses in after the acquisition of femcare 
s m expenses include all customer support costs including training 
in general  training is not required for utmd s products since they are well established and have been clinically widely used 
written instructions for use are packaged with all finished devices 
although utmd does not have any explicit contracts with customers to provide training  it does have third party purchasing organization agreements in the us and uk under which it agrees to provide hospital members in service and clinical training as required and reasonably requested 
utmd promises prospective customers that it will provide  at no charge in reasonable quantities  copies of videotapes and other instruction materials developed for the use of its products 
utmd provides customer support from offices in the us  ireland  uk and australia by telephone  and employed representatives on a geographically dispersed basis  to answer user questions and help troubleshoot any user issues 
occasionally  on a case by case basis  utmd may utilize the services of an independent practitioner to provide educational assistance to clinicians 
all in service and training expenses are routinely expensed as they occur 
except for the consulting services of independent practitioners  all of these services are allocated from fixed s m overhead costs included in operating expenses 
historically  marginal consulting costs have been immaterial to financial results  which is also utmd s expectation for the future 
as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in compared to in and in s m expenses are expected to be about of sales in because utmd expects lower sales which will increase the ratio for the same amount of expenses  expects to have sales people on board throughout the year who were hired in  and plans for additional trade shows  and other marketing initiatives 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing any necessary premarketing clinical trials  regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
as a percent of sales  r d expenses were in compared to in and in utmd will continue to opportunistically invest in r d 
in  r d expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to be consistent with prior years 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  corporate risk management  corporate governance  protection of intellectual property  amortization of identifiable intangibles and legal costs 
in most of these functional areas  there was a lot of redundancy immediately following the femcare acquisition  in addition to one time costs associated with the acquisition 
as a percent of total sales  g a operating expenses were in compared to in and in utmd expects to control g a expenses to about of sales in primarily as a result of reducing its litigation expense 
in summary  in  utmd expects operating expenses about the same as in as a percent of sales  with higher s m expenses offset by lower g a expenses  and r d expenses remaining about the same 
if successful in achieving its sales and gross profit targets stated above  the resulting opm of about would yield operating profits in the range of to million  a decline of about compared to d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income noi includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology  rent from leasing underutilized property to others  income earned from investing the company s excess cash and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses noe which include interest on bank loans  bank service fees and excise taxes 
the medical device excise tax mdet  a component of the patient protection and affordable care act  known commonly as obamacare went into effect after december  the excise tax is of domestic sales of medical devices listed with the fda 
medical devices designed for human use will be taxed  whether or not they are sold for human use  eg veterinarian uses or laboratory use are also taxed 
the justification for the tax given by lawmakers is that medical device companies will enjoy greater sales as a result of obamacare  and they therefore should share in subsidizing the cost of obamacare 
the evidence from utmd s perspective is the opposite fewer of utmd s physician preference devices are being used as us hospitals struggle to hold costs down under obamacare 
the impact of the tax will be felt beyond  as costs associated with administering  tracking  collecting  and paying the tax will be significant 
utmd believes this tax should be recognized as part of its non operating expenses 
net noe combination of noe and noi was in compared to net noe of in and noi of in the largest portion of noe was interest expense on bank loans 
all the other components of noe noi summed to in net noe 
utmd estimates net noe in will be about  lower than in despite the addition of the mdet 
this is because lower interest expense and lack of the impairment charge in more than offset the new mdet 
interest expense 
in  utmd paid in interest expense on the femcare and ireland loans  compared to in and in on just the ireland loan 
the interest expense results from borrowing   and  in march for the purchase of femcare  and   in december to allow the repatriation of profits generated by utmd s ireland subsidiary since inception in through please see note below 
due to decreasing loan principal balances  utmd estimates that its interest expense will be about in investment of excess cash 
investment income including gains and losses on sales in was  compared to in and in average lower interest rates and the use of over million cash in the femcare acquisition caused the reduction from cash in the us is generally currently held in non interest bearing bank accounts because avoiding the bank operating fees which would result from lower balances more than offsets the interest that can be earned at current interest rates 
utmd estimates investment income will also be in royalties 
femcare receives a royalty from licensing the use of the filshie clip intangibles to cooper surgical  inc as part of its us exclusive distribution agreement 
royalties in were compared to in utmd expects to receive in filshie royalties in presently  there are no arrangements under which utmd is receiving royalties from other parties 
other noi 
income received from renting unused warehouse space in ireland and parking lot space in utah for a cell phone tower  offset by bank fees and excise taxes  was in  in and in in  utmd recognized a tax effected impairment on its citigroup stock investment  resulting in a net other noi loss of ie  a noe 
utmd expects other noi will be about in mdet 
the mdet begins in utmd estimates that about one third of its consolidated revenues will be subject to the excise tax 
therefore  utmd estimates the mdet will be about in income before taxes ebt result from subtracting non operating expense from operating income 
consolidated ebt was  in compared to  in and  in ebt margin is ebt divided by total sales 
utmd s consolidated ebt margin was in  in and in the ebt of utmd ltd 
ireland was in  in and in the respective ebt margins of utmd ltd 
ireland were in  in and in femcare s ebt was  compared to  in  ebt margin was in and in utmd is targeting consolidated ebt in the range of to million  a decrease of about compared to  consistent with the decline in gross profits and operating income 
e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes  often called the bottom line 
net income was  in   in and  in the effective consolidated corporate income tax provision rate was  and for the same periods respectively 
year to year fluctuations in the tax rate will result from variation in ebt contribution from subsidiaries in jurisdictions with different corporate income tax rates 
femcare in the uk had an income tax rate of in q and a rate of for the last three quarters of the uk income tax rate of will decline to as of april  the income tax rate for femcare australia has been and will remain at 
profits of the ireland subsidiary are taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products  and a rate on rental and other types of income including domestic sales 
ebt contribution of utmd us operations are currently taxed at a combined federal and state rate prior to special us tax exclusions such as the manufacturing profit deduction  accelerated depreciation of certain assets and r d tax credit 
higher marginal income tax rates would apply for ebt in the us above million 
the possibility of lower corporate income tax rates in the us is not anticipated in utmd s projection for management expects the consolidated average income tax provision rate to be about a half percentage point of ebt lower than the rate due to a greater proportion of consolidated ebt coming from ireland and a lower tax rate in the uk 
utmd s net income margin nim  net income expressed as a percentage of sales  was in  in and in despite the new onerous mdet  utmd projects its nim be comparable to utmd s profitability has consistently ranked it in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies  and has been the primary driver for excellent returns on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money  ie  have exercise prices below the applicable period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were in  in and in if utmd achieves the projections above  eps in will be in the range of share 
to put it simply  the difference between projected eps and actual eps will be about per share for the new mdet and another for a higher average number of diluted shares 
in summary  management expects revenues and net income in to decline about  and gross profit  operating income  ebt  and eps to be down about compared to the ending weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands  compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was shares  compared to in and in actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd after payment of dividends to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable time period 
roe includes balance sheet measures as well as income statement measures 
roe for was before payment of dividends 
roe for was before payment of dividends 
roe for was zero because in utmd paid out all of its net income to shareholders in the form of cash dividends 
prior to the payment of dividends  utmd s roe was 
utmd s roe is primarily driven by its high net income margin 
utmd s roe was higher than in despite lower asset turns and debt ratio  because of its significant improvement in profitability 
utmd s roe before dividends has averaged per year over the last years 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without diluting shareholder interest 
for example  a roe will financially support annual growth in revenues without having to issue more stock 
looking forward  roe may be about before dividends since average shareholder equity is expected to be about million higher without additional share repurchases and net income is expected to be about lower 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options  totaled  in  compared to  in and  in the largest changes in compared to were a net income increase of  and benefits to cash of  from decreased inventories and  for increased accounts payable 
a  decrease in accrued expenses was the largest change that used cash 
other changes were generally consistent with effective working capital management and higher sales activity 
the company s payment of  to acquire femcare was the most significant use of cash in utmd liquidated a net of  of investments to help finance the acquisition 
in investing activities  during utmd used for capital expenditures  for intangible assets  and received from the sale of investments 
cash used for investing activities in was split quite evenly between capital expenditures of  for property and equipment and  as a result of purchases of liquid investments in an effort to maximize returns on excess cash balances while maintaining safety and liquidity 
the large difference in capital expenditures in compared to the two other years was due to utmd s  investment in facility expansion in order to consolidate oregon operations into utah 
in  utmd received a net  from selling and buying investments 
the company borrowed  in to help finance the purchase of femcare 
for the year  utmd paid  in shareholder cash dividends compared to  during in  utmd received  and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options 
employees and directors exercised a total of  option shares in  with  shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options 
option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
the company received a tax benefit from option exercises in utmd repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of during  an average cost of per share 
by comparison  in  utmd received and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
the company received a tax benefit from option exercises in utmd did not purchase any of its own shares in the open market during in  utmd received and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee stock options
