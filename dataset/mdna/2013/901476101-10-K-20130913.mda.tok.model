the fiscal fourth quarter rate was favorably impacted by a favorable change in italian tax law of million 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
during fiscal  the company continued to incur operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where the loss carryforward period is unlimited 
the company has evaluated the realizability of the net deferred tax assets related to these jurisdictions and concluded that based primarily upon recent losses in these jurisdictions and failure to achieve targeted levels of improvement  a full valuation allowance continues to be necessary

however  if the company elects to make voluntary contributions in fiscal  it intends to do so using cash from operations and  if necessary  from available borrowings under existing credit facilities 
net working capital decreased million  or approximately  in fiscal  and the current ratio increased from at june  to at june  the decrease in net working capital was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of a significant decrease in sales in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable due to the significant reduction in inventory in the fourth fiscal quarter of twin disc expects capital expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal these anticipated expenditures reflect the company s plans to continue investing in modern equipment and facilities  its global sourcing program and new products as well as expanding capacity at facilities around the world 
management believes that available cash  the credit facility  cash generated from future operations  existing lines of credit and potential access to debt markets will be adequate to fund twin disc s capital requirements for the foreseeable future

table of contents other matters critical accounting policies the preparation of this annual report requires management s judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the policies management considers most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following accounts receivable twin disc performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjusts credit limits based on payment history and the customer s credit worthiness as determined by review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
in addition  senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivable balances may be uncollectible 
although our accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost has been determined by the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the inventories located in the united states  and by the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
management specifically identifies obsolete products and analyzes historical usage  forecasted production based on future orders  demand forecasts  and economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
the adjustments to the reserve are estimates that could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from the actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
goodwill in conformity with us gaap  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment might exist 
the company performs impairment reviews for its four reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions or third party valuations 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
based upon the goodwill impairment review completed at the end of fiscal  it was determined that the fair value for each of the reporting units significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore goodwill was not impaired 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units  management is required to make estimates of future operating 
table of contents results  including growth rates  and a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions  among others 
our development of future operating results incorporates management best estimates of current and future economic and market conditions which are derived from a review of past results  current results and approved business plans 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions  economic factors and or market indicators could materially change the estimated fair values of the company s reporting units and  therefore  impairment charges could be required in the future 
the following are key assumptions to our discounted cash flow model business projections we make assumptions about the level of sales for each fiscal year including expected growth  if any 
this assumption drives our planning for volumes  mix  and pricing 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels eg  capacity utilization  cost performance  etc these assumptions are key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans that are reviewed annually during the annual budget process 
discount rates when measuring a possible impairment  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital for a potential market participant 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
there are a number of assumptions that management makes when calculating the appropriate discount rate  including the targeted leverage ratio 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
for property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets  excluding indefinite lived intangible assets  the company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
fair value is primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses  however  other methods may be used to substantiate the discounted cash flow analyses  including third party valuations when necessary 
refer to note g of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impairment recorded in fiscal warranty twin disc engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its suppliers 
however  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the extent of the market affected by the failure and the expense involved in satisfactorily addressing the situation 
the warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for warranty costs  management takes into consideration the term of the warranty coverage  historical claim rates and costs of repair  knowledge of the type and volume of new products and economic trends 
while we believe the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable in the future could differ materially from what actually transpires 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the company provides a wide range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement health care coverage 
plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the company s 
table of contents measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  retirement and mortality tables  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the approach used to determine the annual assumptions are as follows discount rate based on the aon hewitt aa above median curve at june  as applied to the expected payouts from the pension plans 
this yield curve is made up of corporate bonds rated aa or better 
expected return on plan assets based on the expected long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers historical returns earned on the funds 
compensation increase reflect the long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates based upon the irs generational mortality table for annuitants and non annuitants for fiscal  and health care cost trend rates developed based upon historical cost data  near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year end measurements of assets and obligations 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources  the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
during fiscal  the company concluded that it was more likely than not that certain net deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions would not be realized  resulting in the recording of a valuation allowance totaling  recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance designed to clarify the financial statement presentation requirements of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists

the amended guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the company s third quarter of fiscal 
see note m of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the additional disclosures required by this new guidance 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued amended guidance that simplifies how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 
after an assessment of certain qualitative factors  if it is determined to be more likely than not that an indefinite lived asset is impaired  entities must perform the quantitative impairment test 
otherwise  the quantitative test is optional 
the amended guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the company s fiscal  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial results 
in september  the fasb issued a standards update that is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
this update permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic intangibles goodwill and other 
this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the company s fiscal 
this standards update did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements

discussion of the company s accounting policies and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements

the company currently has a million revolving loan agreement  which is due to expire on may  in accordance with the loan agreement as amended  the company borrows at libor plus an additional add on  between and  depending on the company s total funded debt to ebitda ratio 
due to the relative stability of interest rates  the company did not utilize any financial instruments at june  to manage interest rate risk exposure 
a percent increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would result in a change in pretax interest expense of approximately  commodity price risk the company is exposed to fluctuation in market prices for such commodities as steel and aluminum 
the company does not utilize commodity price hedges to manage commodity price risk exposure 
direct material cost as a percent of total cost of goods sold was for fiscal currency risk the company has exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations

gains and losses resulting from these contracts offset the foreign exchange gains or losses on the underlying assets and liabilities being hedged 
the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions 
gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income as the changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognized and generally offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in the same period
