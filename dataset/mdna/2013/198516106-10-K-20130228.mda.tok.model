additionally  we license our columbia trademarks across a range of apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment 
sales and distribution we sell our products through a mix of wholesale distribution channels  our own direct to consumer channels  independent distributors and licensees 
the majority of our sales are generated through wholesale channels which include small  independently operated specialty outdoor and sporting goods stores  regional  national and international sporting goods chains  and large regional  national and international department store chains 
we sell our products to independent distributors in various countries where we generally do not have direct sales operations 
we sell our products directly to consumers through our own network of branded and outlet retail stores and online in each of our geographic segments 
our direct to consumer operations are designed to elevate consumer perception of our brands  manage inventory  increase consumer and retailer awareness of and demand for our products  model compelling retail environments for our products and build stronger emotional brand connections with consumers over time 
our branded retail stores and e commerce sites allow us to showcase a broad selection of products and to support the brand s positioning with fixtures and imagery that may then be replicated and offered for use by our wholesale customers 
these stores and sites provide high visibility for our brands and products and help us to monitor the needs and preferences of consumers 
in addition  we operate outlet stores  which serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing us to sell a significant portion of excess  discontinued and out of season products while maintaining the integrity of our brands 
we operate in four geographic segments the united states  latin america and asia pacific laap  europe  middle east and africa emea  and canada  which are reflective of our internal organization  management  and oversight structure

we plan to consolidate our canadian distribution functions at our london facility in in some instances  we arrange to have products shipped directly from the independent factories that manufacture our products to customer designated facilities in canada 
marketing we believe our brand names and trademarks provide a competitive advantage and help to differentiate our products in the marketplace 
marketing supports our position in the marketplace  helps drive alignment through established seasonal initiatives  builds brand equity  raises global brand relevance and awareness  infuses our brands with excitement and stimulates consumer demand for our products worldwide 
during  the cost of our marketing programs represented approximately of net sales 
our integrated marketing efforts are designed to deliver consistent messages about the performance benefits  innovative technologies and styling of our products 
we utilize a variety of means to deliver our messages  including online advertising and social media sites  television and print publications  experiential events  branded retail stores in selected high profile locations  enhanced product displays in partnership with various wholesale customers  and consumer and trade public relations efforts 
we also reinforce our marketing and product innovation messages through selected sponsorships of key outdoor influencers  organizations  events and teams that serve as inspirational models of excellence to customers 
we work closely with our key wholesale customers to reinforce our brand message through cooperative online  television  radio and print advertising campaigns  as well as in stores using branded visual merchandising display tools 
we employ a staff of in store marketing and merchandising coordinators  who visit our customers retail locations in major cities around the world to ensure that our products are favorably presented 
our global internet marketing sites are used by consumers to research our products features and benefits  to interact with content created to inform and entertain about each brand and its technologies  to be directed to nearby retailers where they can purchase our products  and to directly purchase products for delivery in most of our major direct distribution markets 
working capital utilization we design  develop  market and distribute our products  but do not own or operate manufacturing facilities 
as a result  most of our capital is invested in short term working capital assets  including cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable from customers  and finished goods inventory 
at december   working capital assets accounted for approximately of total assets 
as a result  the degree to which we efficiently utilize our working capital assets can have a significant impact on our profitability  cash flows and return on invested capital 
the overall goals of our working capital management efforts are to maintain the minimum level of inventory necessary to deliver goods on time to our customers to satisfy end consumer demand  and to minimize the cycle time from the purchase of inventory from our suppliers to the collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers 
demand planning and inventory management as a branded consumer products company  inventory represents one of the largest and riskiest capital commitments in our business model 
we design and develop our seasonal product lines to months in advance of their availability to consumers in retail stores 
as a result  our ability to forecast and produce an assortment of product styles that match ultimate seasonal wholesale customer and end consumer demand and to deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner can significantly affect our sales  gross margins and profitability 
for this reason  we maintain and continue to make substantial investments in information systems  processes and personnel that support our ongoing demand planning efforts 
the goals of our demand planning efforts are to develop a collaborative forecast that drives the timely purchase of an adequate amount of inventory to satisfy demand  to minimize transportation and expediting costs necessary to deliver products to customers by their requested delivery dates  and to minimize excess inventory to avoid liquidating excess  end of season goods at discounted prices 
failure to achieve our demand planning goals could reduce our revenues and or increase our costs  which would negatively affect our gross margins  profitability and brand strength 
in order to manage inventory risk  we use incentive discounts to encourage our wholesale customers and independent distributors to place orders at least six months in advance of scheduled delivery 
we generally solicit orders from wholesale customers and independent distributors for the fall and spring seasons based on seasonal ordering deadlines that we establish to aid our efforts to plan manufacturing volumes to meet demand for each of our selling seasons 
we use those advance orders  together with forecasted demand from our direct to consumer operations  market trends  historical data  customer and sales feedback and other important factors to estimate the volumes of each product to purchase from our suppliers around the world 
from the time of initial order through production  receipt and delivery  we attempt to manage our inventory to reduce risk 
we typically ship the majority of our advance fall season orders to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in june and continuing through november 
similarly  the majority of our advance spring season orders ship to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in december and continuing through may 
generally  orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment 
our inventory management efforts cannot entirely eliminate inventory risk due to the inherently unpredictable nature of unseasonable weather  consumer demand  the ability of customers to cancel their advance orders prior to shipment  and other variables that affect our customers ability to take delivery of their advance orders when originally scheduled 
to minimize our purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery  we place a significant amount of orders for our products with independent factories prior to receiving our customers advance orders and we maintain an inventory of select products that we anticipate will be in greatest demand 
in addition  we build calculated amounts of inventory to support estimated at once orders from customers and auto replenishment orders on certain long lived styles 
credit and collection we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of each customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist us in scheduling production with our suppliers and delivering seasonal products to our customers on time  we offer customers discounts for placing advance orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before peak seasonal shipping periods 
these extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectable receivables 
in order to manage the inherent risks of customer receivables  we maintain and continue to invest in information systems  processes and personnel skilled in credit and collections 
in some markets and with some customers we use credit insurance or standby letters of credit to minimize our risk of credit loss 
sourcing and manufacturing we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and virtually all of our products are manufactured to our specifications by independent factories located outside the united states 
we generally do not maintain long term manufacturing commitments 
we believe that the use of independent factories enables us to substantially limit our capital expenditures and avoid the costs and risks associated with owning and operating large production facilities and managing large labor forces 
we also believe that the use of independent factories greatly increases our production capacity  maximizes our flexibility and improves our product pricing 
we manage our supply chain from a global and regional perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment  including political risks  factory capacity  import limitations and costs  raw material costs  availability and cost of labor and transportation costs 
however  without long term or reserved commitments  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate or timely production capacity or favorable pricing terms 
our apparel  accessories and equipment are manufactured in approximately countries  with vietnam and china accounting for approximately of our apparel  accessories and equipment production 
our footwear is manufactured in three countries  with china and vietnam accounting for approximately of our footwear production 
our five largest apparel  accessories and equipment factory groups accounted for approximately of global apparel  accessories and equipment production  with the largest factory group accounting for of global apparel  accessories and equipment production 
our five largest footwear factory groups accounted for approximately of global footwear production  with the largest factory group accounting for of global footwear production 
in addition  a single vendor supplies the majority of the zippers used in our products 
most of our largest suppliers have multiple factory locations  thus reducing the risk that unfavorable conditions at a single factory or location will have a material adverse effect on our business 
we maintain manufacturing liaison offices in a total of seven asian countries 
we also maintain a manufacturing liaison office in richmond  california 
personnel in these manufacturing liaison offices are direct employees of columbia  and are responsible for overseeing production at our independent factories 
we believe that having employees physically located in these regions enhances our ability to monitor factories for compliance with our policies  procedures and standards related to quality  delivery  pricing and labor practices 
our quality assurance process is designed to ensure that our products meet our quality standards 
we believe that our quality assurance process is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products 
in addition  independent contractors that manufacture products for us are subject to our standards of manufacturing practices smp 
columbia sources products around the world and values legal  ethical and fair treatment of people involved in manufacturing our products 
each factory producing products for us is monitored regularly against these standards

competition the markets for apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment are highly competitive 
in each of our geographic markets  we face significant competition from numerous and varying competitors  some of which are larger than us and have more marketing resources and operational capabilities with which to compete  and others that are smaller with fewer marketing resources  but deeply entrenched in local markets 
some markets  such as our asian markets  have grown significantly over the last five years and have attracted a large number of competitive local and global brands 
in other markets  such as europe  we face competition from smaller brands that hold significant market share in one or several european markets  but are not viable competitors in other key markets 
some of our large wholesale customers also market competitive apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment under their own private labels 
in addition  our direct to consumer channels expose us to branded competitors who operate retail stores in outlet malls and key metropolitan markets  as well as competitors who sell product online 
our licensees also operate in very competitive markets  such as those for apparel  footwear  sunglasses and watches 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the end use market for active outdoor apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment are brand strength  product innovation  product design  functionality  durability and price 
in addition to competing for end consumer and wholesale market share  we also compete for manufacturing capacity of independent factory groups  primarily in asia  for retail store locations in key markets  and for experienced management  staff and suppliers to lead  operate and support our global business processes 
each of these areas of competition requires distinct operational and relational capabilities and expertise in order to create and maintain long term competitive advantages 
government regulation many of our international shipments are subject to existing or potential governmental tariff and non tariff barriers to trade  such as import duties and potential safeguard measures that may limit the quantity of various types of goods that may be imported into the united states and other countries 
these trade barriers often represent a material portion of the cost to manufacture and import our products 
our products are also subject to domestic and foreign product safety and environmental standards  laws and other regulations  which are increasingly restrictive and complex 
as we strive to achieve technical innovations  we face a greater risk of compliance issues with regulations applicable to products with complex technical features  such as electrical heating components 
although we diligently monitor these standards and restrictions  a state  federal or foreign government may impose new or adjusted quotas  duties  safety requirements  material restrictions  or other restrictions or regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business 
our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows may be materially adversely affected by these and other risks 
please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 
our success depends on our business strategies our business strategies are designed to achieve sustainable  profitable growth by creating innovative products  focusing on product design  utilizing innovations to differentiate our brand from competitors  ensuring that our products are sold through brand enhancing distribution partners around the world  increasing the impact of consumer communications to drive demand for our brands and sell through of our products  making sure our products are merchandised and displayed appropriately in retail environments and continuing to build a brand enhancing direct to consumer business 
we intend to pursue these strategies across our portfolio of brands  product categories and geographic markets 
we face many challenges in implementing our business strategies 
for example  our focus on innovation depends on our ongoing ability to identify  develop or secure rights to product improvements or developments through internal research  joint developments  acquisitions or licenses 
once obtained  these innovations and developments may not be profitable or have the desired effect of increasing demand for our products or enhancing our brands image 
the failure to implement our business strategies successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
to implement our business strategies  we must continue to modify and fund various aspects of our business  to maintain and enhance our information systems and supply chain operations to respond to changes in demand  and to attract  retain and manage qualified personnel 
changes in our business  including efforts to contain costs  may place an increasing strain on management  financial  product design  marketing  distribution  supply chain and other resources  and we may have operating difficulties as a result 
for example  in support of our strategic initiatives  we are making significant investments in our business processes and information technology infrastructure that require significant management attention and corporate resources 
in addition  we may need to adapt our information technology systems and business processes to integrate business acquisitions 
these business initiatives involve many risks and uncertainties that  if not managed effectively  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business strategies and related increased expenditures could also cause our operating margin to decline if we are unable to offset our increased spending with increased sales or gross margins  or comparable reductions in other operating costs 
if our sales or gross margins decline or fail to grow as planned and we fail to sufficiently leverage our operating expenses  our profitability will decline 
this could result in a decision to delay  reduce  modify or terminate our strategic business initiatives  which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
initiatives to upgrade our business processes and information technology infrastructure involve many risks which could result in  among other things  business interruptions and higher costs we regularly implement business process improvement initiatives to optimize our performance 
our current business process initiatives include plans to improve business results through standardization of business processes and technology that support our supply chain and go to market strategies through implementation of an integrated erp software solution over the next several years 
we may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes  including loss of data  decreases in productivity as our personnel become familiar with new systems and lost revenues 
in addition  transitioning to these new or upgraded systems requires significant capital investments and personnel resources 
difficulties in implementing new or upgraded information systems or significant system failures could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we expect implementation of this new information technology infrastructure to have a pervasive impact on our business processes and information systems across a significant portion of our operations 
as a result  we will experience significant changes in our operational processes and internal controls as our implementation progresses 
if we are unable to successfully implement this system  including harmonizing our systems  data and processes  our ability to conduct routine business functions could be negatively impacted and significant disruptions to our business could occur 
in addition  we could incur material unanticipated expenses  including additional costs of implementation or costs of conducting business 
these risks could result in significant business disruptions and have a material adverse effect on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we rely on our highly customized information management systems our business is increasingly reliant on information technology 
information systems are used across our supply chain and retail operations  from design to distribution and sales  and are used as a method of communication among employees  with our subsidiaries and liaison offices overseas and with our customers and retail stores 
we also rely on our information systems to allocate resources  manage product data  develop demand and supply plans  forecast and report operating results and meet regulatory requirements 
system failures  breaches of confidential information or service interruptions may occur as the result of a number of factors  including our failure to properly maintain systems redundancy or to protect  repair  maintain or upgrade our systems  computer viruses  programming errors  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties  and disasters 
any breach or interruption of critical business information systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our legacy erp system  on which we currently manage a substantial majority of our business  is highly customized 
as a result  the availability of internal and external resources with the expertise to maintain this erp system is limited 
our legacy erp system may inhibit our ability to operate efficiently  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
for example  our legacy erp system may not be compatible with other systems that support desired functionality for our operations 
as we transition from our legacy erp system to a new erp system and supporting systems that interface with our new erp system  certain functionality and information from our legacy erp system may not be fully compatible with the new erp system 
as a result  temporary processes may be required  including manual operations  which could significantly increase the risk of human errors in information used by the business and or result in business disruptions  which could have a material adverse effect on our capital resources  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
system security risks  data protection breaches and cyber attacks could disrupt our operations we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business  including sensitive and personally identifiable information 
breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss  inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us  or our customers  including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud  trickery or other forms of deception  could expose us  our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information  result in litigation and potential liability for us  damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business 
in addition  the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant 
experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties  create system disruptions or cause shutdowns 
computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses  worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems 
in addition  sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture  including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 
the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems  bugs  viruses  worms  malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant  and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions  delays  cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales  manufacturing  distribution or other critical functions 
we depend on independent factories our products are manufactured by independent factories worldwide 
although we enter into purchase order commitments with these independent factories each season  we generally do not maintain long term manufacturing commitments with them 
without long term or reserve commitments  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate or timely production capacity or favorable pricing if growth or product demand differs from our forecasts 
independent factories may fail to perform as expected or our competitors may obtain production capacities that effectively limit or eliminate the availability of these resources to us 
if an independent manufacturer fails to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our standards or if we are unable to obtain necessary capacities  we may miss delivery deadlines or incur additional costs  which may cause our wholesale customers to cancel their orders  refuse to accept deliveries  or demand a reduction in purchase prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
reliance on independent factories also creates quality control risks 
independent factories may need to use sub contracted manufacturers to fulfill demand and these manufacturers may have less experience producing our products or possess lower overall capabilities  which could result in compromised quality of our products 
a failure in our quality control program may result in diminished product quality  which in turn could result in increased order cancellations and returns  decreased consumer demand for our products  or product recalls or other regulatory actions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks 
we impose standards of manufacturing practices on our independent factories and licensees for the benefit of workers and require compliance with our restricted substances list and product safety and other applicable environmental  health and safety laws 
we also require our independent factories and licensees to impose these practices  standards and laws on their contractors 
if an independent manufacturer or licensee violates labor or other laws  or engages in practices that are not generally accepted as ethical in our key markets  we may experience production disruptions or significant negative publicity that could result in long term damage to our brands  and in some circumstances parties may attempt to assert that we are liable for the independent manufacturer s or licensee s practices  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by volatility in global production and transportation costs and capacity our product costs are subject to substantial fluctuation based on availability and quality of raw materials  the prices of oil  cotton and other raw materials whose prices are determined by global commodity markets and can be very volatile  changes in labor markets and wage rates paid by our independent factory partners  which are often mandated by governments in the countries where our products are manufactured  particularly in china and vietnam  interest rates and currency exchange rates  availability of skilled labor and production capacity at independent factories  and general economic conditions 
prolonged periods of inflationary pressure on some or all input costs will result in increased costs to produce our products that may result in reduced gross profit or necessitate price increases for our products that could adversely affect consumer demand for our products 
in addition  since the majority of our products are manufactured outside of our principal sales markets  our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances 
shortages in ocean freight capacity  airfreight capacity and volatile fuel costs can result in rapidly changing transportation costs 
for example  during  shortages of sourcing and transportation capacity  combined with later than optimal production of advance orders  caused us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers  resulting in significantly higher freight costs 
because we price our products in advance and changes in transportation and other costs may be difficult to predict  we may not be able to pass all or any portion of these higher costs on to our customers or adjust our pricing structure in a timely manner in order to remain competitive  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by volatile economic conditions we are a consumer products company and are highly dependent on consumer discretionary spending patterns and the purchasing patterns of our wholesale customers as they attempt to match their seasonal purchase volumes to volatile consumer demand 
in addition  as we have expanded our direct to consumer operations  we have increased our exposure to the risks associated with volatile and unpredictable consumer discretionary spending patterns 
consumer discretionary spending behavior is inherently unpredictable and consumer demand for our products may not reach our sales targets  or may decline  especially during periods of heightened economic uncertainty in our key markets  particularly markets in north america and the emea region 
our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately match supply forecast with consumer demand for our products many factors may significantly affect demand for our products  including  among other things  economic conditions  fashion trends  the financial condition of our distributors and wholesale customers  consumer and customer preferences and weather  making it difficult to accurately forecast demand for our products and our future results of operations 
to minimize our purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery  we place a significant amount of orders for our products with independent factories prior to receiving orders from our customers  and we maintain an inventory of various products that we anticipate will be in greatest demand 
in addition  customers are generally allowed to cancel orders prior to shipment 
factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include our reliance  for certain demand and supply planning functions  on manual processes and judgment that are subject to human error  consumer acceptance of our products or changes in consumer demand for products of our competitors  unseasonable weather conditions  unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors  which may result in lower advance orders from wholesale customers and independent distributors  cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers  and weak economic conditions or consumer confidence  which could reduce demand for discretionary items such as our products 
in some cases  we may produce quantities of product that exceed actual demand  which could result in higher inventory levels that we need to liquidate at discount prices 
during periods of weak economic conditions we may experience a significant increase in the volume of order cancellations by our customers  including cancellations resulting from the bankruptcy  liquidation or contraction of certain customers operations 
we may not be able to sell all of the products we have ordered from independent factories or that we have in our inventory 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices through our owned outlet stores or third party liquidation channels  which could have a material adverse effect on our brand image  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
conversely  if we underestimate demand for our products or if our independent factories are unable to supply products when we need them  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages may prevent us from fulfilling customer orders  delay shipments to customers  negatively affect customer relationships  result in increased costs to expedite production and delivery  and diminish our ability to build brand loyalty 
shipments delayed due to limited factory capacity or other factors could result in order cancellations by our customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by weather conditions  including global climate change trends our business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions 
a significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not stimulate demand for our products 
periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter or unseasonably cold or wet weather in the spring and summer may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
unintended inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers resulting from unseasonable weather in one season generally negatively affects orders in future seasons  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
a significant portion of our business is highly dependent on cold weather seasons and patterns to generate consumer demand for our cold weather apparel and footwear 
consumer demand for our cold weather apparel and footwear may be negatively affected to the extent global weather patterns trend warmer  reducing typical patterns of cold weather events  or increasing weather volatility  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
we may not succeed in realizing the anticipated benefits of our new joint venture in china in august we entered into an agreement with swire resources limited swire to establish a joint venture for purposes of continuing the development of our business in china 
the joint venture  in which we will hold a interest  will be established upon satisfaction of specified conditions  including receipt of certain governmental approvals from china 
these approvals are anticipated to be received prior to january   the anticipated effective date of the joint venture  however  these government approvals may not be obtained as anticipated or at all  and if they are not  we may be forced to abandon the joint venture 
even if we are able to establish it  achieving the anticipated benefits of the joint venture is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the following our ability to operate the joint venture will be dependent upon  among other things  our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills  knowledge and experience necessary to carry out the operations of the joint venture 
we anticipate that approximately to employees currently working with or for swire will become employees of  or provide services to  the joint venture 
our ability to effectively operate the joint venture will depend upon our ability to manage the employees of the joint venture  and to attract new employees as necessary to supplement and replace the skills  knowledge and expertise of the existing management team and other key personnel 
we face intense competition for these individuals worldwide  including in china 
we may not be able to attract qualified new employees or retain existing employees to operate the joint venture 
additionally  turnover in key management positions in china could impair our ability to execute our growth strategy  which may negatively affect the value of our investment in the joint venture and the growth of our sales in china 
we will be relying on the operational skill of our joint venture partner 
additionally  because our joint venture partner has voting rights with respect to major business decisions of the joint venture  we may experience difficulty reaching agreement as to implementation of certain changes to the joint venture s business 
for these reasons  or as a result of other factors  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the joint venture  and our participation in the joint venture could adversely affect the results of our operations on a consolidated basis 
continued sales growth in china is an important part of our expectations for our joint venture business 
although china has experienced significant economic growth in recent years  that growth is slowing 
slowing economic growth in china could result in reduced consumer discretionary spending  which in turn could result in less demand for our products  and thus negatively affect the value of our investment in the joint venture and the growth of our sales in china 
although we believe we have achieved a leading market position in china  many of our competitors who are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources  more stable manufacturing resources and greater brand strength are also concentrating on growing their businesses in china 
increased investment by our competitors in this market could decrease our market share and competitive position in china 
our international operations involve many risks we are subject to risks generally associated with doing business internationally 
these risks include the effects of foreign laws and regulations  changes in consumer preferences  foreign currency fluctuations  managing a diverse and widespread workforce  political unrest  terrorist acts  military operations  disruptions or delays in shipments  disease outbreaks  natural disasters and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products 
these factors  among others  may affect our ability to sell products in international markets  our ability to manufacture products or procure materials  and our cost of doing business 
for example  unseasonably warm winter weather and a challenging macroeconomic environment in our emea region have hampered our ongoing efforts to elevate the columbia brand in key european markets  where we have significant infrastructure investments 
if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical  our business may be materially and adversely affected 
as we expand our operations in geographic scope and product categories  we anticipate intellectual property disputes will increase  making it more expensive and challenging to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and to defend against claims of infringement by others 
in addition  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other markets 
any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate  adjust or impose new import limitations  duties  anti dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may have additional tax liabilities as a global company  we determine our income tax liability in various competing tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations 
this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities 
these determinations are the subject of periodic domestic and foreign tax audits 
although we accrue for uncertain tax positions  our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings 
unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes  fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
we earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the us  and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for columbia 
if we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically or at a particular location that we cannot fulfill through borrowings  equity offerings or other internal or external sources  we may experience unfavorable tax and earnings consequences as a result of cash transfers 
these adverse consequences would occur  for example  if the transfer of cash into the united states is taxed and no offsetting foreign tax credit is available to offset the us tax liability  resulting in lower earnings 
furthermore  foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes that foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay or otherwise limit our internal cash transfers from time to time 
we operate in very competitive markets the markets for apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment are highly competitive  as are the markets for our licensed products 
in each of our geographic markets  we face significant competition from global and regional branded apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment companies 
retailers who are our customers often pose our most significant competitive threat by designing and marketing apparel  footwear  equipment and accessories under their own private labels 
for example  in the united states  several of our largest customers have developed significant private label brands during the past decade that compete directly with our products 
these retailers have assumed an increasing degree of inventory risk in their private label products and  as a result  may first cancel advance orders with us in order to manage their own inventory levels downward during periods of unseasonable weather or weak economic cycles 
we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent factories that manufacture our products and for import capacity 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources  more stable manufacturing resources and greater brand strength than we have 
in addition  when our competitors combine operations through mergers  acquisitions or other transactions  their competitive strength may increase 
increased competition may result in reduced access to production capacity  reductions in display areas in retail locations  reductions in sales  or reductions in our profit margins  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers sluggish economies and consumer uncertainty regarding future economic prospects in our key markets have had an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers  some of whom have filed or may file for protection under bankruptcy laws  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of the customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products  we offer customers discounts for placing advance orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before the peak shipping season 
these extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectable receivables 
in addition  we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation or reduced availability of credit insurance coverage when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty 
some of our significant wholesale customers and distributors have liquidated or reorganized  while others have had financial difficulties in the past and have recently experienced tightened credit markets and sales declines and reduced profitability  which in turn has an adverse effect on our business 
we may reduce our level of business with customers and distributors experiencing financial difficulties and may not be able to replace that business with other customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by global credit market conditions economic downturns and economic uncertainty generally affect global credit markets 
our vendors  customers and other participants in our supply chain may require access to credit markets in order to do business 
credit market conditions may slow our collection efforts as customers find it more difficult to obtain necessary financing  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable 
this could result in greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 
credit conditions may impair our vendors ability to finance the purchase of raw materials or general working capital needs to support our production requirements  resulting in a delay or non receipt of inventory shipments during key seasons 
historically  we have limited our reliance on debt to finance our working capital  capital expenditures and investing activity requirements 
we expect to fund our future capital expenditures with existing cash  expected operating cash flows and credit facilities  but if the need arises to finance additional expenditures  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
we may be adversely affected by retailer consolidation when our wholesale customers combine their operations through mergers  acquisitions  or other transactions  their consolidated order volume may decrease while their bargaining power and the competitive threat they pose by marketing products under their own private labels may increase 
some of our significant customers have consolidated their operations in the past  which in turn has had a negative effect on our business 
future customer consolidations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we rely on innovation to compete in the market for our products to distinguish our products in the marketplace and achieve commercial success  we rely on product innovations  including new or exclusive technologies  inventive and appealing design  or other differentiating features 
research and development plays a key role in technical innovation 
we rely upon specialists in the fields of chemistry  biochemistry  engineering  industrial design  electronics and related fields  guided by consumer feedback  to develop and test innovative performance products 
although we are committed to designing innovative and functional products that deliver relevant performance benefits to consumers who participate in a wide range of competitive and recreational outdoor activities  if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products that address consumers performance expectations  demand for our products could decline 
as we strive to achieve product innovations  we face a greater risk of inadvertent infringements of third party rights or compliance issues with regulations applicable to products with technical innovations such as electrical heating components 
in addition  technical innovations often involve more complex manufacturing processes  which may lead to higher instances of quality issues  and if we experience problems with the quality of our products  we may incur substantial expense to address the problems and any associated product risks 
for example  in recent years we incurred costs in connection with recalls of some of our battery powered electrically heated apparel 
failure to successfully bring to market innovations in our product lines could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we face risks associated with consumer preferences and fashion trends changes in consumer preferences or consumer interest in outdoor activities may have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  changes in fashion trends may have a greater impact than in the past as we expand our offerings to include more product categories in more geographic areas  particularly with the sorel brand  a product generally more sensitive to fashion trends 
we also face risks because our business requires us and our customers to anticipate consumer preferences 
our decisions about product designs often are made far in advance of consumer acceptance 
although we try to manage our inventory risk by soliciting advance order commitments by retailers  we must generally place a significant portion of our seasonal production orders with our independent factories before we have received all of a season s advance orders from customers  and orders may be cancelled by customers before shipment 
if we or our customers fail to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences  we may have lower sales  excess inventories and lower profit margins  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our success depends on our use and protection of intellectual property rights our registered and common law trademarks and our patented or patent pending designs and technologies have significant value and are important to our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors and to create and sustain demand for our products 
we also place significant value on our trade dress  the overall appearance and image of our products 
we regularly discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our proprietary rights 
counterfeiting activities typically increase as brand recognition increases  especially in markets outside the united states 
increased instances of counterfeit manufacture and sales may adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 
the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
in markets outside of the united states  it may be more difficult for us to establish our proprietary rights and to successfully challenge use of those rights by other parties 
we also license our proprietary rights to third parties 
failure to choose appropriate licensees and licensed product categories may dilute or harm our brands 
in addition to our own intellectual property rights  many of the intellectual property rights in the technology  fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us 
in those cases  we may not be able to adequately protect our products or differentiate their performance characteristics and fabrications from those of our competitors 
actions or decisions in the management of our intellectual property portfolio may affect the strength of our brands  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with patent  trademark and trade dress disputes  as we focus on innovation in our product lines  extend our brands into new product categories and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  we may become subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other improper use of intellectual property rights of third parties  including third party trademark  copyright and patent rights 
an increasing number of our products include technologies and or designs for which we have obtained or applied for patent protection 
failure to successfully obtain and maintain patents on these innovations could negatively affect our ability to market and sell our products 
future litigation also may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
as we utilize e commerce and social media to a greater degree in our sales and marketing efforts  we face an increasing risk of patent infringement claims from non practicing entities and others covering broad functional aspects of internet operations 
intellectual property litigation may be costly and may divert management s attention from the operation of our business 
adverse determinations in any litigation may result in the loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses from third parties  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our success depends on our distribution facilities our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory  complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our existing distribution facilities  the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and services  such as the transition of the value added services function from independent factories to our distribution centers  and the timely performance of services by third parties  including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities 
in the united states  we rely primarily on our distribution centers in portland  oregon and robards  kentucky  in canada  we have primarily relied on two distribution facilities in strathroy  ontario  one of which was transitioned to a facility in london  ontario in late and the other of which is expected to be transitioned to this same london  ontario facility in  in europe  we rely primarily on our distribution center in cambrai  france  in japan  we rely primarily on a third party logistics distribution provider in tokyo  and in korea  we rely primarily on leased distribution facilities near seoul that we manage and operate 
our distribution facilities in the united states and france are highly automated  which means that their operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to computer viruses  the proper operation of software and hardware  electronic or power interruptions  and other system failures 
we plan to upgrade our warehouse management system and add automation at our distribution facility in canada in risks associated with upgrading or expanding these facilities may significantly disrupt or increase the cost of our operations 
for example  in addition to supporting our traditional wholesale business  our existing distribution facilities have been modified to enable them to also support our e commerce business in the united states 
failure to successfully maintain and update these modifications could disrupt our wholesale and e commerce shipments and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the fixed costs associated with owning  operating and maintaining these large  highly automated distribution centers during a period of economic weakness or declining sales can result in lower operating efficiencies and financial deleverage 
this has occurred in recent years in europe  where our distribution center is underutilized 
this fixed cost structure globally may make it difficult for us to achieve or maintain profitability if sales volumes decline for an extended period of time and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our distribution facilities may also be interrupted by disasters  such as earthquakes  tornadoes or fires 
we maintain business interruption insurance  but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effect that may be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 
we may be adversely affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations although the majority of our product purchases are denominated in us dollars  the cost of these products may be affected by relative changes in the value of the local currencies of our subsidiaries and our manufacturers 
price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins 
our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the us dollar 
because the functional currency of many of our subsidiaries is not the us dollar  we are exposed to the potential of material gains or losses from the remeasurement of us dollar monetary transactions into the respective functional currencies 
currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of the independent factories that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance 
as a result  currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our investments may be adversely affected by market conditions our investment portfolio is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
changes in market conditions  such as those that accompany an economic downturn or economic uncertainty  may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio  perhaps significantly 
our ability to find diversified investments that are both safe and liquid and that provide a reasonable return may be impaired  potentially resulting in lower interest income  less diversification  longer investment maturities and or other than temporary impairments 
we may be adversely affected by labor disruptions our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
while a majority of our own operations are not subject to organized labor agreements  our relationship with our cambrai distribution center employees is governed by french law  including a formal representation of employees by a works council and the application of a collective bargaining agreement 
labor disputes at independent factories where our goods are produced  shipping ports  transportation carriers  retail stores or distribution centers create significant risks for our business  particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes or other disruptions during our peak manufacturing  shipping and selling seasons  and may have a material adverse effect on our business  potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
we depend on key suppliers some of the materials that we use may be available from only one source or a very limited number of sources 
for example  some specialty fabrics are manufactured to our specification by one source or a few sources  and a single vendor supplies the majority of the zippers used in our products 
from time to time  we have difficulty satisfying our raw material and finished goods requirements 
although we believe that we can identify and qualify additional independent factories to produce these materials as necessary  there are no guarantees that additional independent factories will be available 
in addition  depending on the timing  any changes in sources or materials may result in increased costs or production delays  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we depend on key personnel our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel and our ability to attract  retain and develop key managers  designers  sales and information technology professionals and others 
we face intense competition for these individuals worldwide  and there is a significant concentration of well funded apparel and footwear competitors in and around our headquarters in portland  oregon 
we may not be able to attract qualified new employees or retain existing employees  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business is affected by seasonality our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the outdoor industry 
our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our annual net sales are weighted heavily toward the fall winter season  while our operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year 
as a result  the majority  and sometimes all  of our operating profits are generated in the second half of the year 
the expansion of our direct to consumer operations and sales growth in our winter footwear business both sorel and columbia brands has increased the proportion of sales and profits that we generate in the fourth calendar quarter 
this seasonality  along with other factors that are beyond our control and that are discussed elsewhere in this section  may adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate 
as a result  our profitability may be materially affected if management is not able to timely adjust expenses in reaction to adverse events such as unfavorable weather  weak consumer spending patterns or unanticipated levels of order cancellations 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
our products are subject to increasing product regulations and we face risks of product liability and warranty claims our products are subject to increasingly stringent and complex domestic and foreign product labeling and performance and safety standards  laws and other regulations 
these requirements could result in greater expense associated with compliance efforts  and failure to comply with these regulations could result in a delay  non delivery or recall or destruction of inventory shipments during key seasons or in other financial penalties 
significant or continuing noncompliance with these standards and laws could disrupt our business and harm our reputation and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our products are used in outdoor activities  sometimes in severe conditions 
product recalls or product liability claims resulting from the failure  or alleged failure  of our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
most of our products carry limited warranties for defects in quality and workmanship 
we maintain a warranty reserve for future warranty claims  but the actual costs of servicing future warranty claims may exceed the reserve  which may also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our common stock price may be volatile the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market 
factors such as general market conditions  fluctuations in financial results  variances from financial market expectations  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts  or announcements by us or our competitors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially 
insiders control a majority of our common stock and may sell shares three related shareholders  timothy boyle  gertrude boyle and sarah bany  beneficially own a majority of our common stock 
as a result  if acting together  they can effectively control matters requiring shareholder approval without the cooperation of other shareholders 
shares held by these three insiders are available for resale  subject to the requirements of  and the rules under  the securities act of and the securities exchange act of the sale or the prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

our business as one of the largest outdoor apparel and footwear companies in the world  we design  source  market and distribute active outdoor apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment under the columbia  mountain hardwear  sorel and montrail brands 
our products are sold through a mix of wholesale distribution channels  independent distributors  and our own direct to consumer channels 
in addition  we license our columbia trademarks across a range of apparel  footwear  accessories and equipment 
the popularity of outdoor activities  changing design trends  consumer adoption of innovative performance technologies and the availability and desirability of competitor alternatives affect consumer desire for our products 
therefore  we seek to drive  anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings  developing new products with innovative performance features and designs  and creating persuasive and memorable marketing communications to generate consumer awareness  demand and retention 
failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
seasonality and variability of business our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the outdoor industry and is heavily dependent upon weather and discretionary consumer spending patterns 
our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our sales are weighted substantially toward the fall season  while our operating costs are more equally distributed throughout the year 
the expansion of our direct to consumer operations has increased the proportion of sales and profits that we generate in the fourth calendar quarter 
as a result  our sales and profits tend to be highest in the third and fourth calendar quarters 
in  approximately percent of our net sales and all of our profitability were realized in the second half of the year  illustrating our dependence upon sales results in the second half of the year  as well as the less seasonal nature of our operating costs 
we generally solicit orders from wholesale customers and independent distributors for the fall and spring seasons based on seasonal ordering deadlines that we establish to aid our efforts in planning manufacturing volumes to meet demand for each of our selling seasons 
we typically ship the majority of our advance fall season orders to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in june and continuing through november 
similarly  the majority of our advance spring season orders ship to wholesale customers and independent distributors beginning in december and continuing through may 
generally  orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment 
results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period  particularly in light of persistent volatility in economic conditions 
sales of our products are subject to substantial cyclical fluctuation  the effects of unseasonable weather conditions  the relative popularity of competitors brands  and the continued popularity of outdoor activities as part of an active lifestyle in key markets 
volatile economic environments in key markets  coupled with inflationary or volatile input costs  reduce the predictability of our business 
business outlook the global business climate continues to present us with a great deal of uncertainty  making it more difficult to predict future results 
factors that could significantly affect our full year outlook include unseasonable weather conditions or other unforeseen factors affecting consumer demand and the resulting effect on order cancellations  sales returns  customer accommodations  reorders  direct to consumer sales and suppressed demand in subsequent seasons  changes in mix and volume of full price sales in contrast with closeout product sales and promotional sales activity  increased costs to support supply chain and information technology infrastructure investments and projects  including our multi year global enterprise resource planning erp system implementation  our ability to implement and maintain effective cost containment measures in order to limit the growth of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses to a rate comparable to or lower than sales growth  continued economic uncertainty  which is creating headwinds in key global markets  particularly europe as it relates to our emea direct business where we have ongoing efforts to elevate the columbia brand  the rate of new store expansion in our direct to consumer operations  changes in consumer spending activity  including consumer acceptance of increased prices of our products  and fluctuating currency exchange rates 
like other branded consumer product companies  our business is heavily dependent upon discretionary consumer spending patterns 
continuing high levels of unemployment and concerns about potential consumer price increases in our key markets continue to pose significant challenges and risks 
our preliminary outlook assumes net sales comparable to net sales  including a decrease in sales in our north american wholesale channels resulting from cautious wholesale customer purchases following back to back mild winter weather in and  largely offsetting anticipated expansion in our global direct to consumer channels and increased sales in the laap region 
the combination of these assumptions leads us to anticipate operating margin ranging from percent  comparable to the operating margin realized in  to approximately percent 
we are continuing our cost containment measures with the goal of limiting sg a expense as a percentage of net sales 
our previously announced joint venture in mainland china with swire is expected to commence operations effective january   subject to regulatory approval in the people republic of china and other conditions customary in transactions of this size and type 
during  we will begin accounting for the transition to the joint venture from our current third party distributor relationship with swire 
we expect to fund our approximately million share of joint venture capitalization in and the early part of our shipments of spring inventory for the china market  anticipated to begin in the fourth quarter of  will be sold directly to the joint venture entity 
the related sales  gross margin  and licensing income  which we would have recognized in the fourth quarter of under the distributor model  will be deferred and recognized in future periods as the joint venture sells that inventory to wholesale customers and consumers 
similarly  on or about december   swire inventory of fall and prior seasons will be transferred to the joint venture 
we will defer profits related to the inventory transferred to the joint venture and recognize those profits as the inventory is sold by the joint venture in future periods 
the actual amount of these profit eliminations and deferrals into future periods will be dependent upon the volume of spring shipments that occur in the fourth quarter of and the remaining balance of prior season inventory transferred to the joint venture 
these adjustments are not currently included in our preliminary outlook 
as these amounts become more predictable  we will refine our outlook as part of our regular quarterly disclosures 
these factors and others may have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows  particularly with respect to quarterly comparisons 
we remain firmly committed to creating innovative solutions that keep people warm or cool  dry and protected so they can enjoy the outdoors longer  focusing on product design and utilizing our innovations to differentiate our brands from competitors  seeking to sell our products through brand enhancing distribution partners around the world  increasing the impact of consumer communications to drive demand for our brands and sell through of our products  making sure our products are merchandised and displayed appropriately in retail environments  and continuing to build a brand enhancing direct to consumer business

however  based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations  as well as the status of current tax law  it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states

at december   no balance was outstanding under this line of credit and we were in compliance with all associated covenants 
internationally  our subsidiaries have local currency operating lines of credit in place guaranteed by the parent company with a combined limit of approximately million at december   of which million is designated as a european customs guarantee

our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our operations are affected by seasonal trends typical in the outdoor apparel industry  and have historically resulted in higher sales and profits in the third and fourth calendar quarters 
this pattern has resulted primarily from the timing of shipments of fall season products to wholesale customers and proportionally higher sales from our direct to consumer operations in the fourth quarter 
we believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next months will be adequately covered by existing cash  cash provided by operations and existing short term borrowing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table presents our estimated contractual commitments in thousands year ended december  thereafter total inventory purchase obligations operating leases see inventory purchase obligations in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
see operating leases in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have recorded long term liabilities for net unrecognized tax benefits related to income tax uncertainties in our consolidated balance sheet at december  of approximately million  however  they have not been included in the table above because we are uncertain about whether or when these amounts may be settled 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks 
these risks include risks associated with global financial and capital markets  primarily currency exchange rate risk and  to a lesser extent  interest rate risk and equity market risk 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices designed to mitigate the effect of these risks 
we do not engage in speculative trading in any financial or capital market 
our primary currency exchange rate risk management objective is to mitigate the uncertainty of anticipated cash flows attributable to changes in exchange rates 
we focus on mitigating changes in functional currency equivalent cash flows resulting from anticipated us dollar denominated inventory purchases by subsidiaries that use european euros  canadian dollars  japanese yen or korean won as their functional currency 
we manage this risk primarily by using currency forward and option contracts 
additionally  we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge net balance sheet exposures related primarily to intercompany transactions and borrowing arrangements 
the net fair value of our derivative contracts was favorable by approximately million at december  a exchange rate change in the euro  canadian dollar  yen and won against the us dollar would have resulted in the net fair value declining by approximately million at december  a exchange rate change in the yen against the euro would have resulted in the net fair value declining approximately million at december  changes in fair value resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions 
our negotiated credit facilities generally charge interest based on a benchmark rate such as the london interbank offered rate libor 
fluctuations in short term interest rates cause interest payments on drawn amounts to increase or decrease 
at december   our credit facilities had an outstanding balance of  a interest rate change would be immaterial 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results may differ from the estimates we use in applying these critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be important in the circumstances 
many of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policy for revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the provision for potential excess  closeout and slow moving inventory  product warranty  income taxes and stock based compensation 
management regularly discusses with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates  the development and selection of these accounting estimates  and the disclosure about each estimate in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
revenue recognition we record wholesale  distributor  e commerce and licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
title generally passes upon shipment to or upon receipt by the customer depending on the terms of sale with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
where title passes upon receipt by the customer  predominantly in our european wholesale business  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based on historical and expected delivery times by geographic location 
we periodically test the accuracy of these estimates based on actual transactions 
delivery times vary by geographic location  generally from one to five days 
to date  we have found these estimates to be materially accurate 
at the time of revenue recognition  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims  as well as events and circumstances that indicate changes to historical rates of returns and claims 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves that we have established  we will record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such a determination 
allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we analyze specific customer accounts  customer concentrations  credit insurance coverage  standby letters of credit  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
continued uncertainty in credit and market conditions may slow our collection efforts if customers experience difficulty accessing credit and paying their obligations  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable and increased bad debt expense 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectable accounts may differ from our estimates and may have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates and results in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
if we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to sg a expense in the period in which we make such a determination 
excess  close out and slow moving inventory we make ongoing estimates of potential excess  close out or slow moving inventory 
we evaluate our inventory on hand considering our purchase commitments  sales forecasts  and historical experience to identify excess  close out or slow moving inventory and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
if we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
product warranty we make ongoing estimates of potential future product warranty costs 
when we evaluate our reserve for warranty costs  we consider our product warranty policies  historical claim rates by season  product category and mix  current economic trends  and the historical cost to repair  replace  or refund the original sale 
if we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our uncertain tax positions 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could cause our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes to be inaccurate 
changes in any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate  adjusted for discrete items  if any  that are taken into account in the relevant period 
as the calendar year progresses  we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction 
this ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that our year to date provision equals our expected annual effective tax rate 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period using the straight line attribution method 
we estimate stock based compensation for stock awards granted using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires various highly subjective assumptions  including volatility and expected option life 
further  we estimate forfeitures for stock based awards granted  but which are not expected to vest 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period
