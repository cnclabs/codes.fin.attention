after giving effect to expenses  taxes and our continued outstanding preferred stock and senior notes  our net cash balance was approximately million 
in connection with our strategy to make acquisitions or effect business combinations  on may  we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger with plainscapital corporation  a diversified financial institution which provides an array of financial products and services through its business and consumer banking  lending and financial advisory subsidiaries 
on november   concurrent with the consummation of the merger  we became a financial holding company registered under the bank holding company act of  as amended by the gramm leach bliley act of overview on november   hilltop acquired plainscapital corporation in a stock and cash transaction  whereby plainscapital corporation merged with and into meadow corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of hilltop holdings inc  with meadow corporation continuing as the surviving entity under the name plainscapital corporation the merger

prior to the merger with plainscapital corporation  hilltop s primary operations were to provide fire and homeowners insurance to low value dwellings and manufactured homes primarily in texas and other areas of the south  southeastern and southwestern united states 
at december   on a consolidated basis  we had total assets of billion  total deposits of billion  total loans  including loans held for sale  of billion and stockholders equity of billion 
the bank  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  provides a broad array of financial products and services  including commercial banking  personal banking  wealth management and treasury management  from offices located throughout central  north and west texas 
in addition to 
table of contents the bank  we have various subsidiaries with specialized areas of expertise that also offer an array of financial products and services such as mortgage origination  insurance and financial advisory services 
historically  we have derived our revenue from a single insurance segment 
the merger with plainscapital corporation on november  has resulted in an increase to four reportable segments that are organized primarily by the core products offered to the segments respective customers 
we anticipate that future revenues will be driven primarily from the banking and mortgage origination segments  with the remainder being generated by our insurance and financial advisory segments 
based on historical results of plainscapital corporation  the relative share of total revenue provided by our banking and mortgage origination segments fluctuates depending on market conditions  and operating results for the mortgage origination segment tend to be more volatile than operating results for the banking segment 
the banking segment includes the operations of the bank 
the banking segment primarily provides business banking and personal banking products and services and generates revenue from its portfolio of earning assets 
the bank s results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income  while also deriving revenue from other sources  including service charges on customer deposit accounts and trust fees 
the operations of primelending comprise the mortgage origination segment  which offers a variety of loan products from offices in states and generates revenue predominantly from fees charged on the origination of loans and from selling these loans in the secondary market 
the insurance segment includes the operations of nlasco  which operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries  national lloyds insurance company  nlic  and american summit insurance company  asic 
insurance segment revenues are primarily generated from net insurance premiums earned  less loss and loss adjustment expenses lae and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in texas and other areas of the south  southeastern and southwestern united states 
the financial advisory segment generates a majority of its revenues from fees and commissions earned from investment advisory and securities brokerage services at first southwest

we generate revenue from net interest income and from noninterest income 
net interest income represents the difference between the income earned on our assets  including our loans and investment securities  and our cost of funds  including the interest paid on the deposits and borrowings that are used to support our assets 
net interest income is a significant contributor to our operating results 
fluctuations in interest rates  as well as the amounts and types of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities we hold  affect net interest income 
we generated million in net interest income during the year ended december   compared with net interest income of million in and net interest expense of million in the significant increase in net interest income during was primarily due to million in net interest income for the month ended december  from our banking segment that we acquired as a part of the merger 
the other component of our revenue is noninterest income  which is primarily comprised of the following i net gains from sale of loans and mortgage loan origination fees 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  primelending  we generate noninterest income by originating and selling mortgage loans 
during the month ended december   we generated million in net gains from sale of loans and mortgage loan origination fees 
ii investment advisory fees and commissions and securities brokerage fees and commissions 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  first southwest  we provide public finance advisory and various investment banking and brokerage services

the pre tax effects of these items include net accretion on acquired earning assets and liabilities of million  amortization of identifiable intangibles of million  compensation expense of million and the specific merger related expenses of million 
the after tax impact of these items was to increase the net loss by million 
our insurance segment s underwriting gain or loss consists of net insurance premiums earned  less loss  lae and policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses 
underwriting performance is one of the most important factors in evaluating the overall results of our insurance operations given the fluctuations that can occur in loss and lae due to weather related events  as well as the uncertainties involved in the process of estimating reserves for losses and lae

table of contents loan portfolio consolidated loans held for investment at december  are detailed in the table below in thousands and classified by type 
acquired acquired total acquired total impaired performing loans originated loans commercial and industrial real estate construction and land development consumer loans  gross allowance for loan losses loans  net of allowance banking segment the loan portfolio constitutes the major earning asset of the banking segment and typically offers the best alternative for obtaining the maximum interest spread above the banking segment s cost of funds 
the overall economic strength of the banking segment generally parallels the quality and yield of its loan portfolio 
the banking segment s total loans  net of the allowance for loan losses  were billion at december  the banking segment s loan portfolio includes a billion warehouse line of credit extended to primelending  of which billion was drawn at december  and is eliminated from net loans on our consolidated balance sheets 
the banking segment does not generally participate in syndicated loan transactions and has no foreign loans in its portfolio 
at december   the banking segment had loan concentrations loans to borrowers engaged in similar activities that exceeded of total loans in its real estate loan portfolio 
the areas of concentration within our real estate portfolio were construction and land development loans and non construction commercial real estate loans 
at december   construction and land development loans were of total loans  while non construction commercial real estate loans were of total loans 
the banking segment s loan concentrations were within regulatory guidelines at december  the following table provides information regarding the maturities of the banking segment s commercial and real estate loans held for investment  net of unearned income in thousands 
december  due within due from one due after one year to five years five years total commercial and industrial real estate including construction and land development total fixed rate loans floating rate loans total in the table above  floating rate loans that have reached their applicable rate floor or ceiling are classified as fixed rate loans rather than floating rate loans 
the majority of floating rate loans carry an interest rate tied to the wall street journal prime rate  as published in the wall street journal 
mortgage origination segment the loan portfolio of the mortgage origination segment consists of loans held for sale  primarily single family residential mortgages funded through primelending  and pipeline loans  which are loans in various stages of the application process  
table of contents but not yet closed and funded 
pipeline loans may not close if potential borrowers elect in their sole discretion not to proceed with the loan application 
total loans held for sale was billion at december  the components of the mortgage origination segment s loans held for sale and pipeline loans at december  are shown in the following table in thousands 
loans held for sale unpaid principal balance fair value adjustment pipeline loans unpaid principal balance fair value adjustment financial advisory segment the loan portfolio of the financial advisory segment consists primarily of margin loans to customers and correspondents 
these loans are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the clients and  because of collateral coverage ratios  are believed to present minimal collectibility exposure 
additionally  these loans are subject to a number of regulatory requirements as well as first southwest s internal policies 
the financial advisory segment s total loans  net of the allowance for loan losses  were million at december  allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  which represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing portfolio of loans held for investment 
our management has responsibility for determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  subject to review by the audit committee of our board of directors and the directors loan review committee of the bank s board of directors 
it is our management s responsibility at the end of each quarter  or more frequently as deemed necessary  to analyze the level of the allowance for loan losses to ensure that it is appropriate for the estimated credit losses in the portfolio consistent with the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses and the receivables and contingencies topics of the asc 
estimated credit losses are the probable current amount of loans that we will be unable to collect given facts and circumstances as of the evaluation date 
when management determines that a loan  or portion thereof  is uncollectible  the loan  or portion thereof  is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
any subsequent recovery of charged off loans is added back to the allowance for loan losses 
we have developed a methodology that seeks to determine an allowance within the scope of the receivables and contingencies topics of the asc 
each of the loans that has been determined to be impaired is within the scope of the receivables topic and is individually evaluated for impairment using one of three impairment measurement methods as of the evaluation date the present value of expected future discounted cash flows on the loan  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
specific reserves are provided in our estimate of the allowance based on the measurement of impairment under these three methods  except for collateral dependent loans  which require the fair value method 
all non impaired loans are within the scope of the contingencies topic 
estimates of loss for the contingencies topic are calculated based on historical loss experience by loan portfolio segment adjusted for changes in trends  conditions  and other relevant factors that affect repayment of loans as of the evaluation date 
while historical loss experience provides a reasonable starting point for the analysis  historical losses  or recent trends in losses  are not the sole basis upon which to determine the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
management considers recent qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience  including but not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in underwriting standards  changes in economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio  the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans  changes in lending management and staff  changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  the volume of non accrual loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans  changes in the loan review system  changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  and any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 

table of contents we design our loan review program to identify and monitor problem loans by maintaining a credit grading process  ensuring that timely and appropriate changes are made to the loans with assigned risk grades and coordinating the delivery of the information necessary to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
loans are evaluated for impairment when i payments on the loan are delayed  typically by days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection  ii the loan becomes classified  iii the loan is being reviewed in the normal course of the loan review scope  or iv the loan is identified by the servicing officer as a problem 
we review on an individual basis all loan relationships over million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses  the top loan relationships by dollar amount in each market we serve  and additional relationships necessary to achieve adequate coverage of our various lending markets 
homogenous loans  such as consumer installment loans  residential mortgage loans and home equity loans  are not individually reviewed and are generally risk graded at the same levels 
the risk grade and reserves are established for each homogenous pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs from current trends in delinquencies  losses or historical experience and general economic conditions 
at december   we had no material delinquencies in these types of loans 
the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance 
while we believe we have an appropriate allowance for our existing portfolio at december   additional provisions for losses on existing loans may be necessary in the future 
we recorded net charge offs in the amount of million for the month ended december  our allowance for loan losses totaled million at december  in connection with the acquisition of plainscapital  hilltop acquired loans both with and without evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination 
the acquired loans were initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of any allowance for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charged to operations to record the total allowance for loan losses at a level deemed appropriate by the banking segment s management based on such factors as the volume and type of lending it conducted  the amount of non performing loans and related collateral security  the present level of the allowance for loan losses  the results of recent regulatory examinations  generally accepted accounting principles  general economic conditions and other factors related to the ability to collect loans in its portfolio 
the provision for loan losses  primarily in the banking segment  was million for the month ended december  the following table presents the activity in our allowance for loan losses for the month ended december  dollars in thousands

table of contents the distribution of the allowance for loan losses among loan types and the percentage of the loans for that type to gross loans  excluding unearned income  at december  are presented in the table below dollars in thousands 
of gross reserve loans commercial and industrial real estate including construction and land development consumer total potential problem loans potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms but for which management has concerns about the ability of an obligor to continue to comply with repayment terms because of the obligor s potential operating or financial difficulties 
management monitors these loans and reviews their performance on a regular basis 
at december   we had credit relationships totaling million of potential problem loans  which are assigned a grade of special mention within our risk grading matrix 
potential problem loans contain potential weaknesses that could improve  persist or further deteriorate 
if such potential weaknesses persist without improving  the loan is subject to downgrade  typically to substandard  in three to six months 
non performing assets the following table presents our components of non performing assets at december  dollars in thousands 
non performing loans as a percentage of total loans other real estate owned other repossessed assets non performing assets non performing assets as a percentage of total assets at december   non performing loans totaled million all of which were loans secured by residential real estate 
loans past due days and still accruing were million at december   all of which were secured commercial and industrial loans 
there were no troubled debt restructurings at december  other real estate owned was million at december  and included commercial properties of million  commercial real estate property consisting of parcels of unimproved land of million and residential lots under development of million 
insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses the liability for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses represents estimates of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses incurred  including losses for claims that have not yet been reported 
separately for each of nlic and asic and each line of business  our actuaries estimate the liability for unpaid losses and lae by first estimating ultimate losses and lae amounts for each year  prior to recognizing the impact of reinsurance 
the methods that our actuaries utilize to estimate ultimate loss and lae amounts are paid and reported loss development methods and paid and reported bornhuetter ferguson methods 
insured losses for a given accident year change in value over time as additional information on claims is received  as claim conditions change and as new claims are reported 
this process is commonly referred to as loss development 
to project ultimate losses and lae  our actuaries examine the paid and reported losses and lae for each accident year and multiply these values by a loss development factor 
the selected loss development factors are based upon a review of the loss 
table of contents development patterns indicated in the companies historical loss triangles and applicable insurance industry loss development factors 
the bornhuetter ferguson  or bf  method is a procedure that weights an expected ultimate loss and lae amount  and the result of the loss development method 
this method is useful when loss data is immature or sparse because it is not as sensitive as the loss development method to unusual variations in the paid or reported amounts 
the bf method requires an initial estimate of expected ultimate losses and lae 
for each year  the expected ultimate losses and lae is based on a review of the ultimate loss ratios indicated in the companies historical data and applicable insurance industry ultimate loss ratios 
each loss development factor  paid or reported  implies a certain percent of the ultimate losses and lae is still unpaid or unreported 
the amounts of unpaid or unreported losses and lae by year are estimated as the percentage unpaid or unreported  times the expected ultimate loss and lae amounts 
to project ultimate losses and lae  the actual paid or reported losses and lae to date are added to the estimated unpaid or unreported amounts 
the results of each actuarial method performed by year are reviewed to select an ultimate loss and lae amount for each accident year 
in general  more weight is given to the loss development projections for more mature accident periods and more weight is given to the bf methods for less mature accident periods 
the combination of the methodologies described above is used for all insurance lines of business  regardless of whether the line is a short tailed or long tailed line of business  though specific parameter selections within the methods vary to reflect the nature of the underlying line of business 
asic and nlic specialize in writing fire and extended coverage for low value dwellings  mobile homes and homeowners  which generally are considered short tailed coverages 
in addition  asic and nlic write a small amount of commercial risks  which are still predominantly property coverages  along with some low limit liability coverages 
the reserve analysis performed by our actuaries provides preliminary central estimates of the unpaid losses and lae 
at each quarter end  the results of the reserve analysis are summarized and discussed with our senior management 
the senior management group considers many factors in determining the amount of reserves to record for financial statement purposes 
these factors include the extent and timing of any recent catastrophic events  historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications  the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and reported loss patterns  the consistency of claims handling processes  the consistency of case reserving practices  changes in our pricing and underwriting  and overall pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market 
in arriving at our best estimate of the unpaid losses and lae  and based on management discussion with our actuaries  we would consider reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions  such as the underlying loss development pattern or the expected loss ratio  to have an impact on our best estimate by 
at december   this equates to approximately million  or of insurance segment equity  and of calendar year insurance losses

table of contents deposits the company s major source of funds and liquidity is its deposit base 
deposits provide funding for its investment in loans and securities 
interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense and overall net interest margin 
the composition of the deposit base time deposits versus interest bearing demand deposits and savings is constantly changing due to the banking segment s needs and market conditions

liquidity and capital resources hilltop is a holding company whose assets primarily consist of the stock of its subsidiaries and invested assets with a combined value of billion at december  hilltop s primary investment objectives  as a holding company  are to preserve capital and have available cash resources to utilize in making acquisitions  and  if necessary or appropriate  from additional equity or debt financing sources 
liquidity refers to the measure of our ability to meet our customers short term and long term deposit withdrawals and anticipated and unanticipated increases in loan demand without penalizing earnings 
interest rate sensitivity involves the relationships between rate sensitive assets and liabilities and is an indication of the probable effects of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest income 
we discuss our management of interest rate and other risks in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk herein 

table of contents our asset and liability group is responsible for continuously monitoring our liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet our short term and long term cash requirements 
funds invested in short term marketable instruments  the continuous maturing of other interest earning assets  cash flows from self liquidating investments such as mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  the possible sale of available for sale securities  and the ability to securitize certain types of loans provide sources of liquidity from an asset perspective 
the liability base provides sources of liquidity through deposits and the maturity structure of short term borrowed funds 
for short term liquidity needs  we utilize federal fund lines of credit with correspondent banks  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  borrowings from the federal reserve and borrowings under lines of credit with other financial institutions 
for intermediate liquidity needs  we utilize advances from the fhlb 
to supply liquidity over the longer term  we have access to brokered certificates of deposit  term loans at the fhlb and borrowings under lines of credit with other financial institutions 
at december   million of our series b preferred stock was outstanding under the sblf 
the series b preferred stock has an aggregate liquidation preference of million and qualifies as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
the terms of the series b preferred stock provide for the payment of non cumulative dividends on a quarterly basis 
the dividend rate  as a percentage of the liquidation amount  fluctuates while the series b preferred stock is outstanding based upon changes in the level of qualified small business lending qsbl by the bank from its historical average level of qsbl at each of the four quarter ends leading up to june  the baseline 
until march  the dividend rate will generally decrease if we increase our level of qsbl from the baseline and increase if we decrease our level of qsbl from the baseline  subject to certain limitations described in the certificate of designations 
the dividend rate on the series b preferred stock was at december  the dividend rate for the period from january  to march  is 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements may prompt certain actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
at december   hilltop exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of  tier capital to risk weighted assets ratio of and a tier capital to average assets  or leverage  ratio of 
the tier capital to average assets ratio was calculated using the average assets for the month of december at december   the bank was also considered to be well capitalized 
we discuss regulatory capital requirements in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
cash and cash equivalents consisting of cash and due from banks and federal funds sold  totaled million at december   an increase of million from million at december  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and borrowed funds  and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
these factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds 
cash provided by operations during was million  an increase in cash flow of million compared with cash provided by operations increased primarily due to the plainscapital acquisition on november  and inclusion of operating activities of the banking  mortgage origination and financial advisory segments for the month ended december  we use cash primarily to originate loans and purchase securities for our investment portfolio 
during  the amount of cash used by lending activities decreased by million compared with our investment securities portfolio was billion at december  cash used in our investment activities included net purchases of securities for our investment portfolio during  which were million compared to net purchases of million during we sold approximately million and million of available for sale securities during the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities during was million  an increase in cash provided of million compared with the increase in cash provided was due primarily to the plainscapital acquisition on november  and the inclusion of financing activities of the banking segment for the month ended december  we had deposits of billion at december   all of which resulted from the plainscapital acquisition 
deposit flows are affected by the level of market interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors  the volatility of equity markets and other factors 
at december   money market deposits  including brokered deposits  were billion  time deposits  including brokered deposits  were billion and noninterest bearing demand deposits were million 
our largest depositors  excluding our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  first southwest and primelending  accounted for approximately of our total deposits  and our five largest depositors  excluding first southwest  accounted for approximately of our total deposits at december  the loss of one or more of our largest customers  or a significant decline in the deposit balances due to ordinary course fluctuations related to these customers businesses  could adversely affect our liquidity and might require us to raise deposit rates to attract new deposits  purchase federal funds or borrow funds on a short term basis to replace such deposits 
we have not experienced any liquidity issues to date with respect to brokered deposits or our other large balance deposits  and we believe alternative sources of funding are available to more than compensate for the loss of one or more of these customers 
primelending funds the mortgage loans it originates through a warehouse line of credit of up to billion maintained with the bank 
at december   primelending had outstanding borrowings of billion against the warehouse line of credit 
primelending sells substantially all mortgage loans it originates to various investors in the secondary market with servicing released  although it may retain servicing in limited circumstances 
as these mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market  primelending pays down its warehouse line of credit with the bank 
in addition  primelending has an available line of credit with an unrelated commercial bank of up to million 
at december   primelending had no borrowings under this line of credit

table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations at december  in thousands 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses does not have contractual maturity dates 
however  based on historical payment patterns  the amounts presented are management s estimate of the expected timing of these payments 
the timing of payments is subject to significant uncertainty 
nlasco maintains a portfolio of investments with varying maturities to provide adequate cash flows for such payments 
payments due by period more than years or year year but less more but less years or less than years than years or more total reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses short term borrowings long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which presently requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities 
off balance sheet arrangements  commitments  guarantees in the normal course of business  we enter into various transactions  which  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  are not included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
we enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding 
we minimize our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
we assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and have recorded a liability related to such credit risk in our consolidated financial statements 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  we would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
in the normal course of business  fsc executes  settles and finances various securities transactions that may expose fsc to off balance sheet risk in the event that a customer or counterparty does not fulfill its contractual obligations 
examples of such transactions include the sale of securities not yet purchased by customers or for the account of fsc  clearing 
table of contents agreements between fsc and various clearinghouses and broker dealers  secured financing arrangements that involve pledged securities  and when issued underwriting and purchase commitments 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as more information is becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the followings are considered to be our critical accounting estimates 
our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
our accounting policies are described in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements  which are included in this annual report 
you are encouraged to read in its entirety note to our consolidated financial statements for additional insight into management s approach and methodology in estimating the allowance for loan losses 
we believe that the following are our significant accounting policies  the allowance for loan losses and our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
loans are charged to the allowance when the loss is confirmed or when a determination is made that a probable loss has occurred on a specific loan 
recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery 
throughout the year  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance for credit losses is appropriate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
based on these estimates  an amount is charged to the provision for loan losses and credited to the allowance for loan losses in order to adjust the allowance to a level determined to be appropriate to absorb losses 
management s judgment regarding the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses involves the consideration of current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential loan losses and the present level of the allowance  results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the ability to collect certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
the amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic  operating or other conditions beyond our control 
for additional discussion of allowance for loan losses and provisions for loan losses  see the section entitled allowance for loan losses earlier in this item reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to events that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period but have not been paid 
months and potentially years may elapse between the occurrence of a loss covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the loss and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for claims that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
as claims are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for claims that have occurred but have not been reported ibnr 
each of our insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for all of its unpaid losses  including case reserves and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we estimate our ibnr reserves by estimating our ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves first  and then reducing that amount by the amount of cumulative paid claims and by the amount of our case reserves 
the reserve analysis performed by our actuaries provides preliminary central estimates of the unpaid losses and lae 
at each quarter end  the results of the reserve analysis are summarized and discussed with our senior management 
the senior management group considers many factors in determining the amount of reserves to record for financial statement purposes 
these factors include the extent and timing of any recent catastrophic events  historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications  the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and reported loss patterns  the consistency of claims handling processes  the consistency of case reserving practices  changes in our pricing and underwriting  and overall pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market 
as experience develops or new information becomes known  we increase or decrease the level of our reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
see loss and loss adjustment expense reserves earlier in this item for additional discussion 

table of contents goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are not amortized for financial statement purposes 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may be impaired  an interim impairment test would be required 
intangible assets with finite lives have been fully amortized over their useful lives 
we perform required annual impairment tests of our goodwill and other intangible assets as of december st for our insurance reporting unit  while the acquired banking  mortgage origination and financial advisory reporting units will be tested for impairment annually as of october st 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires us to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and recent industry transaction and trading multiples of our peers  and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment  if any  by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
our evaluation includes multiple assumptions  including estimated discounted cash flows and other estimates that may change over time 
if future discounted cash flows become less than those projected by us  future impairment charges may become necessary that could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition in the period in which the write off occurs 
loan indemnification liability the mortgage origination segment may be responsible for errors or omissions relating to its representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements  including representations as to underwriting standards and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan 
if determined to be at fault  the mortgage origination segment either repurchases the loans from the investors or reimburses the investors losses a make whole payment 
the mortgage origination segment has established an indemnification liability for such probable losses based upon  among other things  the level of current unresolved repurchase requests  the volume of estimated probable future repurchase requests  our ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase requests  and the severity of the estimated loss upon repurchase 
although we consider this reserve to be appropriate  there can be no assurance that the reserve will prove to be appropriate overtime to cover ultimate losses  due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy and historical loss patterns  discrete events adversely affecting specific borrowers or industries  and or actions taken by institutions or investors 
the impact of such matters will be considered in the reserving process when known 
acquisition accounting we account for business combinations using the acquisition method  which requires an allocation of the purchase price of an acquired entity to the assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
management applies various valuation methodologies to these acquired assets and assumed liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued 
examples of such items include loans  deposits  identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in business combinations 
management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items  including  among others  projected cash flows  prepayment and default assumptions  discount rates  and realizable collateral values 
the purchase date valuations  which are considered preliminary and are subject to change for up to one year after the acquisition date  determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the business combination 
while we are in the process of finalizing our purchase price allocation  significant changes are not anticipated 
certain assumptions and estimates must be updated regularly in connection with the ongoing accounting for purchased loans 
valuation assumptions and estimates may also have to be revisited in connection with periodic assessments of possible value impairment  including impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and certain other long lived assets 
the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results  which could have material positive or negative effects on the company s results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk some of the information below contains forward looking statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses  and therefore our actual results may differ from any of the following projections 
this forward looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
we are engaged primarily in the business of investing funds obtained from deposits and borrowings in interest earning loans and investments  and our primary component of market risk is interest rate risk volatility 
consequently  our earnings depend to a significant extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on loans and investments and our interest expense on deposits and borrowing 
to the extent that our interest bearing liabilities do not reprice or mature at the same time as our interest bearing assets  we are subject to interest rate risk and corresponding fluctuations in net interest income 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the magnitude of the change in earnings and market value of equity resulting from interest rate changes is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  the general level of interest rates and customer actions 
our objective is to measure the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on our earnings and capital 
repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower or higher rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
we have employed asset liability management policies that attempt to manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  thereby attempting to control the volatility of net interest income  without having to incur unacceptable levels of credit or investment risk 
we manage our exposure to interest rates by structuring our balance sheet in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  the asset liability management policies permit the use of various derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk or hedge specified assets and liabilities 
an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or experiences an interest rate change in line with general market interest rates 
the management of interest rate risk is performed by analyzing the maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time gap and by analyzing the effects of interest rate changes on net interest income over specific periods of time by projecting the performance of the mix of assets and liabilities in varied interest rate environments 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income resulting from a movement in interest rates 
a company is considered to be asset sensitive  or have a positive gap  when the amount of its interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest bearing liabilities also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  a company is considered to be liability sensitive  or have a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
however  it is our intent to achieve a proper balance so that incorrect rate forecasts should not have a significant impact on earnings 
interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the amount of assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice through specified periods 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis in the table below reflects changes in banking segment earnings and costs resulting from changes in assets and liabilities on december  that will either be repriced in accordance with market rates  mature or are estimated to mature early within the periods indicated 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time 
as illustrated in the table below  the banking segment is asset sensitive overall 
loans that adjust daily or monthly to the wall street journal prime rate comprise a large percentage of interest sensitive assets and are the primary cause of the 
table of contents banking segment s asset sensitivity 
to help neutralize interest rate sensitivity  the banking segment has kept the terms of most of its borrowings under one year dollars in thousands 
december  months or months to year to years to less year years years years total interest sensitive assets loans securities federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell other interest sensitive assets total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities interest bearing checking savings time deposits notes payable other borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap percentage of cumulative gap to total interest sensitive assets the positive gap in the interest rate sensitivity analysis indicates that banking segment net interest income would generally rise if rates increase 
because of inherent limitations in interest rate sensitivity analysis  the banking segment uses multiple interest rate risk measurement techniques 
simulation analysis is used to subject the current repricing conditions to rising and falling interest rates in increments and decrements of  and to determine the effect on net interest income changes for the next months 
the banking segment also measures the effects of changes in interest rates on market value of equity by discounting projected cash flows of deposits and loans 
market value changes in the investment portfolio are estimated by discounting future cash flows and using duration analysis 
investment security prepayments are estimated using current market information 
we believe the simulation analysis presents a more accurate picture than the gap analysis 
simulation analysis recognizes that deposit products may not react to changes in interest rates as quickly or with the same magnitude as earning assets contractually tied to a market rate index 
the sensitivity to changes in market rates varies across deposit products 
also  unlike gap analysis  simulation analysis takes into account the effect of embedded options in the securities and loan portfolios as well as any off balance sheet derivatives 
the table below shows the estimated impact of increases of  and and a decrease of in interest rates on net interest income and on market value of portfolio equity for the banking segment at december  dollars in thousands 
december  change in changes in changes in interest rates net interest income market value of equity basis points amount percent amount percent the projected changes in net interest income and market value of equity to changes in interest rates at december  were in compliance with established internal policy guidelines 
these projected changes are based on numerous assumptions of growth and changes in the mix of assets or liabilities 
the historically low level of interest rates  combined with the existence of rate floors that are in effect for a significant portion of the loan portfolio  are projected to cause yields on our earning assets to rise more slowly than increases in market 
table of contents interest rates 
as a result  in a rising interest rate environment  our interest rate margins are projected to compress until the rise in market interest rates is sufficient to allow our loan portfolio to reprice above applicable rate floors 
at december   total debt outstanding on our consolidated balance sheet was million  and was comprised of approximately million of indebtedness subject to fixed interest rates and approximately million  or  subject to variable interest rates 
if libor and the prime rate were to increase by one eighth of one percent  the increase in interest expense on the variable rate debt would not have a significant impact on our future consolidated earnings or cash flows
