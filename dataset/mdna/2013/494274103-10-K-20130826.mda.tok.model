item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview kimball international  inc the company  kimball  we  us  or our provides a variety of products from our two business segments the electronic manufacturing services ems segment and the furniture segment 
the ems segment provides engineering and manufacturing services which utilize common production and support capabilities globally to the automotive  medical  industrial  and public safety industries 
the furniture segment provides furniture for the office and hospitality industries  sold under kimball family of brand names 
the pace of the economic recovery has been slow  and key economic indicators are showing mixed trends 
the uncertainty has the tendency to cause disruption in business strategy  execution  and timing in many of the markets in which we compete 
ems industry projections by idc and ihs in the february mmi publication are forecasting growth for calendar year over in the to range 
growth projections for calendar year are in the to range 
additionally  in june the semiconductor industry association sia endorsed a forecast for year over year semiconductor sales growth of for calendar year and for calendar year  and although the company does not directly serve this market  it may be indicative of the end market demand for products utilizing electronic components 
kimball focus is on the four key vertical markets of automotive  medical  industrial  and public safety within our ems segment 
our overall expectation for the ems market is that of moderate growth  but with mixed demand 
the automotive end market is benefiting from relative strength in the us market and an uptick in the chinese automotive market  while demand in other geographies such as europe continues to be less certain due to the lingering impact of the european debt crisis 
the industrial market demand is improving but continues to reflect a lower demand for heating  cooling  and ventilation hvac products than historical levels 
demand in the medical and public safety markets remains stable 
the business and institutional furniture manufacturer association bifma forecast by ihs as of may projects a year over year increase in the office furniture industry for calendar year of driven by stronger growth in the latter half of calendar year improved year over year growth of is projected for calendar year the hospitality furniture market forecast june pwc and pkf hospitality research reports projects an increase in occupancy rates of and an increase in revpar revenue per available room of for calendar year over calendar year for calendar year  occupancy is forecast to increase to  and revpar is forecast to increase in the range of to 
the company focus on cost control continues 
at the same time  we plan to continue to invest in capital expenditures prudently for projects in support of both organic growth and potential acquisitions that would enhance our capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability 
we also continue to closely monitor market changes and our liquidity in order to proactively adjust our operating costs  discretionary capital spending  and dividend levels as needed 
managing working capital in conjunction with fluctuating demand levels is likewise key 
in addition  a long standing component of kimball profit sharing incentive bonus plan is that it is linked to our worldwide  group  or business unit performance which is designed to adjust compensation expense as profits change 
we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet  which included minimal long term debt of million and share owners equity of million as of june  our short term liquidity available  represented as cash and cash equivalents plus the unused amount of our credit facilities  was million at june  in addition to the above discussion related to the current market conditions  management currently considers the following events  trends  and uncertainties to be most important to understanding kimball financial condition and operating performance inflation has moderated and does not appear to be a significant risk in the near term  but we continue to focus on mitigating the impact of raw material commodity pricing pressures 
due to the contract and project nature of the ems and furniture industries  fluctuation in the demand for the company products and variation in the gross margin on those projects is inherent to our business 
effective management of the manufacturing capacity is and will continue to be critical to our success 
the healthcare reform legislation that was signed into law in march and upheld by the supreme court in june is expected to increase our healthcare and related administrative expenses as the provisions of the law become effective over the next couple of years 
globalization continues to reshape not only the industries in which we operate but also our key customers and competitors 
kimball employees throughout the business operations are an integral part of our ability to compete successfully  and the stability of the management team is critical to long term share owner value 
our career development and succession planning processes help to maintain stability in management

fiscal year results of operations financial overview consolidated fiscal year consolidated net sales were billion compared to fiscal year net sales of billion  a increase  resulting from a net sales increase in the ems segment which more than offset a net sales decrease in the furniture segment 
fiscal year net income was million  or per class b diluted share  inclusive of million  or per class b diluted share  of after tax restructuring costs 
the company recorded net income for fiscal year of million  or per class b diluted share  inclusive of million  or per class b diluted share  of after tax restructuring costs primarily related to the european consolidation plan 
consolidated gross profit as a percent of net sales improved to for fiscal year from in fiscal year due to margin improvement in the ems segment  which was partially offset by a decline in furniture segment margin coupled with a shift in sales mix as depicted in the table below toward the ems segment which operates at a lower gross profit percentage than the furniture segment

fiscal year ems segment gross profit as a percent of net sales improved percentage points when compared to fiscal year the improvement in gross profit as a percent of net sales was primarily the result of leverage gained on higher revenue as well as benefits gained from global purchasing efforts and operating efficiencies related to continuous improvement initiatives 
the ems segment fiscal year gross profit was also favorably impacted by the benefits realized from restructuring activities in which two facilities were closed during the second quarter of fiscal year ems segment fiscal year gross profit was unfavorably impacted by a million inventory reserve recorded relating to a customer that notified us they are going out of business 
ems segment selling and administrative expenses in absolute dollars increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  and were flat as a percent of net sales due to the higher sales volumes 
the selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs related to the significant improvement in the ems segment earnings

new customers and program start ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program  which are generally recovered as the program becomes established and matures 
risk factors within the ems segment include  but are not limited to  general economic and market conditions  customer order delays  increased globalization  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  rapid technological changes  component availability  supplier and customer financial stability  the contract nature of this industry  the concentration of sales to large customers  and the potential for customers to choose a dual sourcing strategy or to in source a greater portion of their electronics manufacturing

furniture segment furniture segment results follow at or for the year ended june amounts in millions change net sales operating income loss operating income loss net income open orders the fiscal year net sales decrease in the furniture segment compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from decreased net sales of hospitality furniture and to a lesser extent from decreased net sales of office furniture 
the lower hospitality furniture net sales were due to two unusually large custom projects that were completed during fiscal year the decrease in office furniture net sales was due to decreased sales volumes which more than offset the positive impact of price increases net of incremental discounting 
the largest driver of the decreased office furniture sales volumes was lower sales to the federal government 
fiscal year sales of newly introduced office furniture products which have been sold for less than twelve months approximated million 
open orders of furniture products at june  increased from the orders open as of june  on higher orders of both office furniture and hospitality furniture 
open orders at a point in time may not be indicative of future sales trends 
fiscal year furniture segment gross profit as a percent of net sales declined of a percentage point when compared to fiscal year items unfavorably impacting the year over year gross margin comparison were the loss of leverage due to lower current year sales volumes  an unfavorable sales mix  a prior year favorable impact resulting from a decrease in the lifo inventory reserve  and a prior year recovery of previously paid import duties related to a retroactive change in a tariff rate 
fiscal year gross profit as a percent of net sales was favorably impacted by sales price increases net of incremental discounting and by lower commodity costs 
compared to fiscal year  fiscal year selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased percentage points largely due to the lower sales volumes and also due to a absolute dollar increase in selling and administrative expenses driven by higher incentive compensation costs which were partially offset by decreased sales and marketing costs and decreased commission expense

the fiscal year effective tax rate was as relatively low pre tax income coupled with the favorable impact of the company earnings mix and the research and development credit resulted in a tax benefit despite our pre tax income

the decline in net sales to the medical industry was attributable to the expiration of a contract with one medical customer bayer ag late in fiscal year which accounted for a million decline in net sales in fiscal year excluding this customer  net sales to the medical industry  as well as the overall ems segment net sales  increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year open orders as of june  were up compared to june  fiscal year ems segment gross profit as a percent of net sales improved percentage points when compared to fiscal year the improvement was primarily driven by the benefit from a sales mix shift toward higher margin product and benefits realized related to restructuring activities in which two facilities were closed during the second quarter of fiscal year ems segment selling and administrative expenses in absolute dollars decreased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  but increased as a percent of net sales on the lower sales volumes 
the selling and administrative expenses declined primarily due to benefits realized from restructuring activities within this segment 
ems segment other income expense for fiscal year totaled expense of million  compared to expense of million in fiscal year the variance in other income expense was primarily related to net foreign currency exchange movement 
included in this segment were a significant amount of sales to bayer ag affiliates in fiscal year which accounted for the following portions of consolidated net sales and ems segment net sales year ended june bayer ag affiliated sales as a percent of consolidated net sales bayer ag affiliated sales as a percent of ems segment net sales kimball sales to bayer ag declined due to the expiration of our primary manufacturing contract with this customer 
this contract accounted for a majority of the sales to bayer ag during fiscal year margins on the bayer ag product were generally lower than the company other ems products 
furniture segment furniture segment results follow at or for the year ended june amounts in millions change net sales operating income operating income net income open orders the fiscal year net sales increase in the furniture segment compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from increased net sales of hospitality furniture and to a lesser extent from increased net sales of office furniture 
the increase in net sales of hospitality furniture was driven by large custom projects during fiscal year the increase in office furniture net sales was due to the positive impact of price increases net of incremental discounting which more than offset a decrease in sales volume 
fiscal year sales of newly introduced office furniture products which have been sold for less than twelve months approximated million 
open orders of furniture products at june  decreased from the orders open as of june  primarily due to lower office furniture orders from the us federal government and a large hospitality custom project received near the end of fiscal year which was included in the june  open orders 
fiscal year furniture segment gross profit as a percent of net sales improved percentage points when compared to fiscal year fiscal year gross profit as a percent of net sales was favorably impacted by sales price increases net of incremental discounting  by a recovery of previously paid import duties related to a retroactive change in a tariff rate  and by the favorable impact resulting from a decrease in the lifo inventory reserve 
the improvement in fiscal year gross profit as a percent of net sales was partially offset by commodity cost increases  higher freight and fuel costs  and the impact of excess operating capacity at select locations 
fiscal year selling and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars by  but decreased as a percent of net sales on the higher sales volumes  when compared to fiscal year the selling and administrative expenses were impacted by higher salary expenses  higher incentive compensation costs  and increased travel expenses 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at june  was million compared to working capital of million at june  the current ratio was at both june  and june  our measure of accounts receivable performance  also referred to as days sales outstanding dso  for fiscal year of days improved compared to the days for fiscal year we define dso as the average of monthly accounts and notes receivable divided by an average day net sales 
our production days supply on hand pdsoh of inventory measure for fiscal year declined to days from days for fiscal year the improved pdsoh compared to the prior fiscal year resulted from ongoing successful initiatives to reduce or maintain ems segment inventory levels as the business grows 
we define pdsoh as the average of the monthly gross inventory divided by an average day cost of sales 
kimball short term liquidity available  represented as cash and cash equivalents plus the unused amounts of our credit facilities  totaled million at june  compared to million at june  our cash and cash equivalents position improved to million at june  from million at june  we had no short term borrowings outstanding as of june  or june  operating activities generated million of cash flow in fiscal year compared to the million of cash generated by operating activities in fiscal year during fiscal year  we reinvested million into capital investments for the future with the largest investments being made for manufacturing equipment and facility improvements within both segments 
kimball also paid million of dividends in fiscal year consistent with our historical dividend policy  the company board of directors will evaluate the appropriate dividend payment on a quarterly basis 
during fiscal year  we expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures prudently  particularly for projects including potential acquisitions that would enhance our capabilities and diversification while providing an opportunity for growth and improved profitability 
during fiscal year  kimball entered into a credit agreement which amended  restated  and extended the company previously existing primary five year credit facility 
kimball elected to decrease the borrowing limit on our primary credit facility to million from the million under the previous agreement 
we believe our principal sources of liquidity from available funds on hand  cash generated from operations  and the availability of borrowing under our credit facilities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future 
at both june  and june   we had no short term borrowings outstanding under either the million credit facility or the former million credit facility 
at june   the company had million in letters of credit against the million credit facility 
the million credit facility has a maturity date of december  and allows for both issuances of letters of credit and cash borrowings 
the million credit facility provides an option to increase the amount available for borrowing to million at our request  subject to the consent of the participating banks 
the million credit facility requires us to comply with certain debt covenants  the most significant of which are the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda debt to ebitda and minimum net worth excluding accumulated other comprehensive income 
we were in compliance with the respective debt covenants of both the million credit facility and the previous million credit facility during the fiscal year ended june  the table below compares the actual net worth and debt to ebitda ratio with the limits specified in the credit agreement 
covenant at or for the period ended june  limit as specified in credit agreement excess minimum net worth debt to ebitda ratio the debt to ebitda ratio is calculated on a rolling four quarter basis as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition to the million credit facility  the company can opt to utilize foreign credit facilities which are available to satisfy short term cash needs at a specific foreign location rather than funding from intercompany sources 
we maintain a million foreign credit facility for our ems segment operation in thailand which is backed by the million revolving credit facility via a letter of credit 
we have a credit facility for our ems segment operation in poland  which allows for multi currency borrowings up to million euro equivalent approximately million us dollars at june  exchange rates 
these foreign credit facilities can be canceled at any time by either the bank or by us 
we had no borrowings outstanding under these foreign credit facilities as of june  or june  total availability to borrow in usd equivalent under all of our credit facilities totaled million at june  another source of funds in addition to our credit facilities has been our ability to generate cash from operations to meet our liquidity obligations which could be adversely affected in the future by factors such as general economic and market conditions  lack of availability of raw material components in the supply chain  a decline in demand for our products  loss of key contract customers  the ability of kimball to generate profits  and other unforeseen circumstances 
in particular  should demand for our products decrease significantly over the next months  the available cash provided by operations could be adversely impacted 
the preceding statements include forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements 
fair value during fiscal year  no level or level financial instruments were affected by a lack of market liquidity 
for level financial assets  readily available market pricing was used to value the financial instruments 
the company foreign currency derivatives  which were classified as level assets liabilities  were independently valued using observable market inputs such as forward interest rate yield curves  current spot rates  and time value calculations 
to verify the reasonableness of the independently determined fair values  these derivative fair values were compared to fair values calculated by the counterparty banks 
the company own credit risk and counterparty credit risk had an immaterial impact on the valuation of the foreign currency derivatives 
during fiscal year  we purchased the convertible debt securities of a privately held company with the principal and interest due in june we also received stock warrants to purchase the common and preferred stock of the privately held company at a specified exercise price 
during fiscal year  the convertible debt securities experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value resulting in a million impairment loss and  upon a qualified financing  were subsequently converted to non marketable equity securities 
also during fiscal year  the revaluation of stock warrants resulted in a million derivative gain as a result of the qualified financing 
during fiscal year  the privately held company experienced delays in their start up  and therefore initiated another round of financing that we chose not to participate in  which resulted in the automatic conversion of preferred shares and warrants to common shares and warrants 
upon the conversion  the equity securities and warrants were revalued  resulting in an impairment loss of million on the equity securities and a million derivative loss on the stock warrants during fiscal year during fiscal year  due to certain events and changes in circumstances that had an adverse effect on the fair value of the investment in the privately held company  we revalued the investment which resulted in a million impairment loss on the equity securities and a million derivative loss on the stock warrants 
the investment in non marketable equity securities is accounted for as a cost method investment which carries the securities at cost 
in the event of impairment  the valuation uses a probability weighted black scholes option pricing model 
the stock warrants are classified as derivative instruments and are valued on a recurring basis using a market based approach which utilizes a probability weighted black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value measurements for stock warrants and the impairment of non marketable equity securities were calculated using unobservable inputs and were classified as level financial assets

the preceding statements are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies kimball consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates  which are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience  and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
management overlays a fundamental philosophy of valuing its assets and liabilities in an appropriately conservative manner 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the policies that are most critical in the portrayal of kimball financial position and results of operations 
management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company board of directors and with the company independent registered public accounting firm 
revenue recognition kimball recognizes revenue when title and risk transfer to the customer  which under the terms and conditions of the sale may occur either at the time of shipment or when the product is delivered to the customer 
service revenue is recognized as services are rendered 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as sales while the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
we recognize sales net of applicable sales tax 
sales returns and allowances at the time revenue is recognized certain provisions may also be recorded  including a provision for returns and allowances  which involve estimates based on current discussions with applicable customers  historical experience with a particular customer and or product  and other relevant factors 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the provisions to be adjusted accordingly 
at june  and june   the reserve for returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
the returns and allowances reserve approximated to of gross trade receivables during fiscal years and allowance for doubtful accounts allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on a percentage of aged accounts receivable  where the percentage increases as the accounts receivable become older 
however  management judgment is utilized in the final determination of the allowance based on several factors including specific analysis of a customer credit worthiness  changes in a customer payment history  historical bad debt experience  and general economic and market trends 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  and june  was million and million  respectively  with a large portion of the increase attributable to one furniture segment customer 
this reserve approximated of gross trade accounts receivable during fiscal years and excess and obsolete inventory inventories were valued using the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market value for approximately and of consolidated inventories at june  and june   respectively  including approximately and of the furniture segment inventories at june  and june   respectively 
the remaining inventories were valued at lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market value 
inventories recorded on our balance sheet are adjusted for excess and obsolete inventory 
in general  we purchase materials and finished goods for contract based business from customer orders and projections  primarily in the case of long lead time items  and we have a general philosophy to only purchase materials to the extent covered by a written commitment from our customers 
however  there are times when inventory is purchased beyond customer commitments due to minimum lot sizes and inventory lead time requirements  or where component allocation or other procurement issues may exist 
we may also purchase additional inventory to support transfers of production between manufacturing facilities 
evaluation of excess inventory includes such factors as anticipated usage  inventory turnover  inventory levels  and product demand levels 
factors considered when evaluating inventory obsolescence include the age of on hand inventory and reduction in value due to damage  use as showroom samples  design changes  or cessation of product lines 
self insurance reserves kimball is self insured up to certain limits for auto and general liability  workers compensation  and certain employee health benefits such as medical  short term disability  and dental with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial statements 
our policy is to estimate reserves based upon a number of factors including known claims  estimated incurred but not reported claims  and other analyses  which are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such matters as increased medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and reserve levels to be adjusted accordingly 
at june  and june   our accrued liabilities for self insurance exposure were million and million  respectively 
taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we provide a valuation allowance based on our best estimate of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes ultimately realizable 
future events could change management assessment 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
however  we believe we have made adequate provision for income and other taxes for all years that are subject to audit 
as tax periods are effectively settled  the provision will be adjusted accordingly 
the liability for uncertain income tax and other tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties on those positions  was million at june  and million at june  new accounting standards see 
note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding new accounting standards 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange rate risk kimball operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
derivatives are used only to manage underlying exposures and are not used in a speculative manner 
further information on derivative financial instruments is provided in 
note derivative instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we estimate that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from levels at june  and relative to non functional currency balances of monetary instruments  to the extent not hedged by derivative instruments  would not have a material impact on profitability in an annual period 
equity risk kimball holds an investment in the non marketable equity securities and stock warrants of a privately held company 
if the private company experiences certain events or circumstances  such as the loss of customers  the inability to achieve growth initiatives  or if there are factors beyond its control in the markets which it serves  the private company performance could be affected materially resulting in a loss of some or all of its value  which could result in an other than temporary impairment of the investment
