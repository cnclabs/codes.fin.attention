executive level overview active power is headquartered in austin  texas  where we design and manufacture our patented flywheel based uninterruptible power supply ups products and modular infrastructure solutions mis 
these solutions are designed to ensure continuity for data centers and other mission critical operations in the event of power disturbances 
our products and solutions are designed to deliver continuous conditioned clean power during power disturbances and outages  voltage sags and surges  and provide ride through power in the event of utility failure  supporting operations until utility power is restored or a longer term alternative power source  such as a diesel generator is started 
we believe our products offer an advantage over those of our competitors in the areas of power density less space and energy efficiency  total cost of ownership  system reliability  modular design  and the economically green benefits of our solutions 
our patented flywheel based ups products store kinetic energy by constantly spinning a compact steel wheel flywheel driven from utility power in a low friction environment 
when the utility power used to spin the flywheel fluctuates or is interrupted  the flywheel s inertia causes it to continue spinning 
the resulting kinetic energy of the spinning flywheel generates electricity known as bridging power for short periods  until either utility power is restored or a backup electric generator starts and takes over generating longer term power in the case of an extended electrical outage 
we believe our flywheel products provide many competitive advantages over conventional battery based ups products  including substantial space savings  higher power densities  green energy storage  and higher power efficiencies up to 
this high energy efficiency reduces operating costs and provides customers a lower total cost of ownership 
we offer our flywheel products with load capabilities up to  kva 
our flywheel based ups systems are marketed under the brand name cleansource 
as of december   we had shipped more than  flywheels in ups system installations  delivering more than megawatts of power to customers in countries around the world  providing nearly million runtime hours of operation 
ups product revenue may include ancillary components delivered as part of a total ups solution 
in late we introduced our next generation cshd kva and kva ups product  which we plan to start distributing in we also sell modular infrastructure solutions  which incorporate our ups products with other equipment including switchboards and a generator to provide complete short and long term protection in the event of a power disturbance 
where this integrated solution is sold in a containerized package  it is marketed under the brand name powerhouse 
powerhouse can be deployed in an iso or purpose built container depending upon location 
these systems are specifically designed to handle the demands of the most technically advanced facilities requiring the highest power integrity available while maximizing up time  useable floor space and operational efficiency 
designed to offer a highly flexible architecture to respond to a customer s constantly changing environment  our powerhouse systems are offered in four standard configurations  enabling sizing for infrastructure on demand 
these systems are highly differentiated as they offer flexibility in placement  space savings  rapid deployment  high energy efficiency  and just in time use of capital deployment 
they also deliver significant value to customers as the entire system is integrated and tested prior to delivery for a repeatable simple solution 
we also sell modular power infrastructure solutions to customers in a non containerized format  typically deploying such solutions inside buildings 
we plan to continue growing revenue in coming years from current and future customers as modular data center infrastructure continues to gain acceptance in the market 
in close cooperation with strategic partners in the technology industry and leveraging our expertise in containerization and power distribution  in we began to manufacture modular it infrastructure solutions  designed to specification for select it channel business partners 
these solutions serve as the infrastructure for modular data center deployment model and are in themselves self contained fully functional data centers 
modular data centers may be rapidly deployed with other modular infrastructure such as power and cooling to deliver a cost effective alternative to traditional raised floor data centers 
active power designs and delivers the exterior shell and a fully outfitted interior including electrical  cooling  monitoring  and other elements ready for the it channel partner to add its it racks and servers 
after the it channel partner adds its it equipment to our modular it infrastructure solution  the it channel partner has a functional data center ready for deployment at its end user site 
finally  we offer services in the form of installation  maintenance  project management  and other professional services 
services are often sold in conjunction with the products above  and are increasingly becoming a larger part of our overall revenue 

table of contents our headquarters is located in austin  texas  with international offices in the united kingdom  germany and china 
in  of our product revenue came from the sale of ups systems and from the sale of modular infrastructure solutions 
our total revenue in increased by million  or  from  primarily driven by an increase in ups sales  up million or over sales of our modular infrastructure solution products decreased by approximately million  or  compared to as we saw a decrease in demand from our it channel partners in the us service revenue increased in compared to we sell our products to a wide array of commercial and industrial customers across a variety of vertical markets  including data centers  manufacturing  technology  broadcast and communications  financial  utilities  healthcare  government and airports 
however  our primary focus is on data center applications within these vertical markets 
we have expanded our global sales channels and direct sales force  selling in major geographic regions of the world  but particularly in north america  europe and asia 
we sell our products through the following distribution methods sales made directly by active power  manufacturer s representatives  distributors  oem partners  and strategic it partners 
we believe a number of underlying macroeconomic trends place us in a strong position to be one of the leading providers of critical power protection and infrastructure solutions 
these trends include the increasing business costs of downtime  a rapidly expanding need for data center infrastructure  ever increasing demands placed on the public utility infrastructure  an inadequate investment in global utility infrastructure  rising costs of energy worldwide driven by volume of energy used  and an increasing demand for economically green solutions 
we have evolved significantly since the company was founded in our early focus was on research and development of the core products that continue to enable our business today 
over the past several years  we have focused our efforts on brand  markets  and channels of distribution 
the technological foundation of active power has yielded more than worldwide patents and a highly differentiated  cost efficient product platform that we have evolved into an expanding suite of infrastructure solutions 
as we go forward  it is critical for us to focus on both developing technology to maintain and grow our leadership position and building channels of distribution to have more avenues into the market 
we have developed and implemented a go to market strategy to set the direction for our sales and marketing initiatives and plans around the following components customer data center applications across vertical markets distribution partner enabled distribution strategy transacted locally geography global markets served from four centers of operation products ups and modular infrastructure systems value efficient  reliable  green solutions service installation maintenance  project management and other professional services as a result of this strategy  we have been successful in improving our operating performance  broadening our global footprint  diversifying our customer base  broadening our sales channels and partners  and moving higher up the customer value chain with innovative developments of our core underlying product technology 
in line with our ongoing efforts to improve margins and operational efficiency and to achieve consistent and growing levels of profitability  we have been evaluating our fixed costs 
during the third quarter of  we executed cost savings measures that we expect to yield annualized savings of about million 
we believe these measures will help ensure we are making appropriate investments for the future while also aligning our overhead to support consistent and profitable growth 

table of contents our revenue derived from north america was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
our revenue derived from customers located in europe was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
our revenue derived from customers located in asia was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
our largest revenue growth occurred in the european market  where our revenues increased by million or from to our decrease in revenues in north america in was primarily derived from decreased sales of our modular infrastructure solutions 
the decrease in revenues in asia was driven by non repeated business from a small number of large customer orders 
we believe our total revenue will grow in from both our products and services 
with the introduction of the cshd kva and kva ups product we expect to further increase our competitiveness to better serve the ups markets 
we also believe that the global growth in data center demand and from cloud based computing and storage requirements will lead to higher sales of our ups products 
we are specifically targeting those customers with large it and power needs who have the ability to make frequent and large ups purchases as their global operations expand 
in addition  we expect continuing market acceptance of our modular power infrastructure solutions to drive higher sales of our powerhouse products globally 
our gross margins fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending on changes in the product and geographic mix our revenues and were as high as during the fourth quarter of and as low as in the first quarter 
on an annual basis  our gross profit margin increased to in from in and in the increase in gross profit margin in from reflects the impact of an increase in the sales of our ups systems  a higher percentage of services of our total revenue  and a decline in sales volume of our modular infrastructure solutions 
our modular infrastructure solution products generally earn lower margins for us than sales of our ups products because they include a higher proportion of third party ancillary equipment 
in  we also had lower unabsorbed manufacturing costs due to higher utilization of our manufacturing facility  further improving our gross margins 
margins on our services are typically higher than on our product sales 
however  as we gain more experience in the deployment of our modular infrastructure solutions  we anticipate an improvement in the margins we generate from this product as well 
our operating losses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our operating results include non cash stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in operating losses from to was due to the improvement of our gross margins despite the modest growth in revenue  slightly offset by a higher level of operating costs 
our operating costs increased by or million in compared to  primarily due to increased engineering costs associated with the development of our latest new ups product announced in the fourth quarter of  sales and marketing costs associated with increased investments in this area in and early  and general and administrative expenses associated with restructuring costs  equipment impairment  and professional fee expenses 
the larger sales price of our powerhouse and modular it infrastructure orders can cause large quarterly fluctuations in our inventory  receivables and payables balances  depending on the number of such orders in progress at any point in time 
this can cause material fluctuations in the level of working capital we require 
if the number of such orders increases rapidly or any of these orders have payment terms that are less favorable  we will need access to more working capital to fund the growth of our business and to fulfill these orders 
we extended our bank revolving line of credit in to provide a source of funding for this scenario  to help fund our growth and manage our working capital requirements 
we have a history of operating losses and have not yet reached operating profitability on an annual basis 
we believe that the success of our flywheel ups products  our modular infrastructure solutions  and our service revenue combined with our focus on direct sales to customers and a lower overall operating cost base  will help us to further increase our revenues and reduce our level of operating losses and the amount of cash that we consume in our operations 
to manage and reduce our operating costs  we recently took a number of actions including a reduction in headcount in the third quarter of we will need to continue to focus on operating costs and the management of cash and working capital in to maintain sufficient funds for our operating activities 
our total cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million at december  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and our sources of available liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our sales cycle is such that we generally have visibility two to three quarters in advance for future orders  this allows us to anticipate revenues over this period of time with some degree of confidence 
however  a sudden change in business volume or product mix  positive or negative  from any of our business or channel partners or in our direct business can significantly impact our expected revenues and impact our ability to quickly respond to opportunities 
the continued slow global economic growth has reduced our confidence in the ability to predict future revenues  and even with improving economic conditions  there is still uncertainty and risk in our forecasting 
this two to three quarter window of sales visibility does provide us with some opportunity to adjust expenditures or take other measures to reduce our cash consumption if we can see and anticipate a shortfall in revenue or give us time to identify additional sources of funding if we anticipate an increase in our working capital requirements due to increased revenues or changes in our revenue mix 
a significant increase in sales  especially in our modular infrastructure solutions business  would likely increase our working capital requirements due to the longer production time and cash cycle of sales of these products 

table of contents should additional funding be required or desirable  we expect to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or equity securities  the ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
results of operations product revenue product revenue primarily consists of sales of our ups products and our modular infrastructure solutions 
our cleansource power quality products are comprised of both ups and energy storage product lines and our mis products consist of our modular power infrastructure solutions  including powerhouse which are comprised of our ups systems and some combination of third party ancillary equipment  such as engine generators and switchgear and our modular it infrastructure solutions that provide a combination of power distribution  cooling capabilities  security systems  fire suppression and monitoring capabilities for our business partners 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change our product revenue represented  and of total revenue for  and  respectively 
our product revenue was derived from the following sources in thousands change from prior year change from prior year product revenue ups product revenue modular infrastructure solutions total product revenue comparison of to the decrease of our product revenue in compared to came from lower sales of our modular infrastructure solutions  primarily as a result of decreased large customer project orders from our it channel partners 
we were able to partially offset this by an increase in the international sales of our ups and ancillary products 
we believe the success of our business resides in a higher mix of sales of our core ups products 
our mis products tend to be larger in value and derive sales from a smaller number of customers compared to sales of our ups products 
this smaller number of customers with greater transaction value can contribute to large quarterly fluctuations in revenue from each product family due to the timing of orders and shipments in any particular accounting period 
a small number of transactions can lead to significant revenue but cause greater volatility in our quarterly results and increase liquidity risk 
to manage this risk we will continue to refine and improve the payment terms of these opportunities as part of our working capital management process 
we expect revenue to grow in coming years  as we introduce our next generation ups products and other new products that result from our investment in research and development 
product sales from our oem channels  which were primarily from the sale of ups systems  represented of our product revenue for compared to in sales of our ups products are a much smaller part of our oem partner s total business and subject to more volatility in quarterly sales  particularly during difficult economic periods as the oem partners focus on their core business 
in we saw fewer transactions but larger value transactions from our oem channel 
product revenue from our oem channels decreased in relative to  after decreasing in compared to these declines reflect decreased performance from our oem partners  specifically in the us market 
we have supported our oem partners efforts to sell total solutions to their customers that include generators and switchgear that they manufacture along with our ups products as a total solution 
if our oem partners are successful with this strategy  we believe that it will help drive an increase in our ups product revenue 
however  as our oem partners sell more solutions  quarterly revenue becomes more variable 
caterpillar remains one of our largest customers as well as our largest oem customer 
sales to caterpillar represented of our total revenue in compared to in 
table of contents product sales from our it channel partners represented of product revenues for compared to in this reduction reflects decreased demand of our mis products during from our it channel partners  primarily by hp 
the level of orders may continue to fluctuate depending on our partner s success and need for infrastructure solutions 
north america sales were of our product revenue for  compared to for our north america sales decreased by in compared to  primarily as a result of lower mis product revenue and the decrease in sales from our oem channels 
we also sell products directly to customers in asia and europe and we have a network of international distributors in other territories 
in these markets  customers are more likely to purchase a total power solution such as powerhouse from us rather than a stand alone ups system 
this usually results in a longer selling cycle and makes quarterly results from these regions more inconsistent and dependent upon a smaller number of larger value transactions 
thus  the amount of revenue from our international markets can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  but continue to increase when evaluated on an annual basis 
our sales in europe increased by in to million as we continue to expand our sales force and operations  particularly in germany and the uk where we have had an increase in ups sales 
our sales in asia decreased by in to million  which was primarily due to changing our focus from japan  after closing our regional office there  to sales in china  where we see more return on investment opportunity and long term growth potential 
china represents the second largest ups market in the world and has the potential to become a substantial market for our products 
over time we anticipate increasing sales of our ups products as well as our mis products in china 
we have historically experienced a lag between adding sales and service capabilities and generating meaningful revenue from a new territory 
as a result  we would expect that the investments we have made during the last few years in europe and asia will generate higher revenues from these regions in we continue to invest in sales  service and marketing capabilities in each of these regions as well as building brand awareness for our company and products globally 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenue will continue to be derived from international sales 
sales of our branded products through our direct and manufacturer s representative channels represented   and of our product revenue for   and  respectively 
as direct sales typically have higher profit margins than sales through our oem and it channels  we will continue to focus on building our direct sales channel to increase revenue and improve profit margins and to decrease our dependency upon any particular channel partner 
we believe sales of our active power branded products in markets that were not covered by our oems will continue to increase over time and will continue to become a larger percentage of our total revenue 
comparison of to the growth of our product revenue in came from the sale of modular infrastructure solutions  including powerhouse  as our solutions gained market acceptance 
we were able to significantly increase volume for these products through our it channel partners and also with our direct sales organization  particularly in the europe and asia markets 
we have been able to capitalize on the growing modular infrastructure solution market  where our modular power solutions offer higher power density and lower operating costs than competitive systems 
our solution is highly complementary to the offerings of it companies marketing modular data center and it products 
we introduced the modular it infrastructure solutions during as a way to capitalize on this complementary opportunity and to help grow sales of our powerhouse products into the modular data center market 
we were also successful at selling our powerhouse product directly to military  utility and data center customers during our efforts to grow modular power and it infrastructure solution sales reflects our strategy of focusing on selling total solutions and not just ups products to our customers 
offsetting this increase in sales of our modular power and it infrastructure products  we experienced a decline in sales of our ups products in we had an absence of large ups only orders in from hyper scale it and collocation customers who had purchased large volumes of ups products directly from us in  particularly in the north american market that caused a decrease in ups product revenues 
we also saw a decline in sales volume from our oem partners who historically have been our largest customer of ups systems 
individual modular power infrastructure sales have been as high as million in  as we delivered multiple modular power infrastructure products to single customers and our single largest order for modular infrastructure products was over million in product sales from our oem channels  which were primarily from the sale of ups systems  represented of our total revenue for compared to in sales of our ups products are a much smaller part of our oem partner s total business and subject to more volatility in quarterly sales  particularly during difficult economic periods as the oem partners focus on their core business 
in we saw fewer transactions  but larger value transactions from our oem channel 
product revenue from our oem channels decreased by in relative to  after increasing by in compared to  reflecting decreased performance from our oem partners 
caterpillar was one of our largest customers as well as our largest oem customer in 
table of contents product sales from our it channel partners represented of our product revenues for compared to of product revenues in this growth reflected the increased sales of modular power and it infrastructure solutions during by our it channel partners for their end customers 
north america sales were of our total revenue for  compared to for our north america sales increased by in compared to  primarily as a result of lower ups systems revenue and the decrease in sales from our oem channels  which was offset by the continued growth in sales of our modular power and it infrastructure solutions 
we also sell products directly to customers in asia and europe and we have a network of international distributors in other territories to sell our products 
in these markets  customers are more likely to purchase a total power solution such as powerhouse from us rather than a stand alone ups system

thus the amount of revenue from our international markets can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  but continue to increase when evaluated on an annual basis 
our sales in europe increased by in to million as we continued to expand our sales force and operations  particularly in germany and the uk where we have had success selling modular power infrastructure solutions into the data center market 
our sales in asia increased by in to million  which increase primarily consists of increasing powerhouse sales in china 
sales of active power branded products through our direct and manufacturer s representative channels represented of our product revenue for  compared to for service and other revenue service and other revenue primarily relates to revenue generated from both traditional after market service work and from customer specific system engineering 
this includes revenue from design  installation  startup  repairs or reconfigurations of our products and the sale of spare or replacement parts to our oem and end user customers 
it also includes revenue associated with the costs of travel of our service personnel and revenues or fees received upon contract deferment or cancellation 
revenue from extended maintenance contracts with our customers is also included in this revenue category 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change service and other revenue increased by for  compared to this increase is primarily due to higher levels of service and contract work from direct product sales and from professional fees associated with modular infrastructure solution sales 
for these customers we provide a full power solution  including site preparation  installation of an entire power solution and provision of all products required to provide a turnkey product to the end user often including maintenance services 
we also had increased service revenues from maintenance contracts and repair related activities as our increasing install base of ups customers provides greater opportunities to generate such revenues 
in situations where we make sales through our oem channel  it is typical for the oem to provide these types of services to their end user customers directly  so these revenue sources do not exist on our oem sales 
service and other revenue increased by for  compared to this increase is primarily due to higher levels of service and contract work from direct product sales and from professional fees associated with powerhouse and other modular infrastructure solutions sales 
we also had increased service revenues from maintenance contracts and repair related activities as our increasing install base of ups customers provides greater opportunities to generate such revenues 

table of contents cost of product revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of component parts of our products  ancillary equipment that is sourced from external suppliers  personnel  equipment and other costs associated with our assembly and test operations  including costs from having underutilized facilities  depreciation of our manufacturing property and equipment  shipping costs  warranty costs  and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our cost of product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the cost of product revenue decreased by in  while our product revenues decreased by 
this reflects improved pricing on our ups products  a change in product mix towards higher ups sales  as well as a focused effort to increase efficiencies by reducing levels of unabsorbed overhead costs 
cost of product revenue also included million of stock based compensation expense in both and the cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue was and in and  respectively 
during and we operated a manufacturing facility that has a manufacturing and testing capacity significantly greater than required by our current product revenue levels 
we also continued to improve the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility  which comprises of a large portion of our fixed costs 
we incurred approximately million and million  in and respectively  in fixed costs for our manufacturing facility 
our manufacturing capacity is in excess of our current business requirements 
we expense the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues 
the increase in cost of product revenue compares to the increase in product revenues that we experienced in compared to this disparity reflects the higher relative cost and lower margin on our modular power and it infrastructure products that we have historically experienced 
cost of product revenue also included million and million of stock based compensation expense in and  respectively 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue was in  compared to for this increase in cost as a percentage of revenue compared to reflects the impact of sales product mix and the higher levels of unabsorbed overhead costs attributable to a lower level of ups system production 
our margins on modular infrastructure solutions sales were lower compared to the margins realized on our ups sales because we realized lower margins on the third party equipment that we purchased and included in our containerized product offerings 
cost of service and other revenue cost of service and other revenue includes the cost of component parts that we use in service or sell as spare parts  as well as labor and overhead costs of our service organization 
this includes travel and related costs incurred in fulfilling service obligations to our customers and the costs of third party contractors used in completion of some of our professional services 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our cost of service and other revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the cost of service and other revenue decreased by in while our service and other revenues increased by 
as a percentage of service and other revenues  our costs were of revenue in  compared to in this decrease in the cost of service and other revenue reflects higher utilization of service personnel and improved revenues on professional service work we perform for mis systems installations 
we continued to expand our service team to broaden the geographic regions where we have service capability as our total business grows 
operationally  we were challenged to manage the growth of our service organization so that it scales with the growth in total revenues so that we can meet customer requirements without growing our service organization cost structure too rapidly 
the utilization of our service personnel will also be affected by the number of modular infrastructure solution products implemented in a particular period  in periods where we have a low number of installation projects  our costs as a percentage of revenue would be expected to increase 
a large portion of the costs involved in operating our service organization are fixed in nature and we incur approximately million to million in unabsorbed overhead each quarter 
we continued to work on reducing our service overhead through better utilization of our service employees and cost control measures 
this infrastructure also means that we can leverage this investment and grow our service capabilities substantially by adding direct technical labor only as required 

table of contents the cost of service and other revenue increased by in while our service and other revenues increased by 
as a percentage of service and other revenues  our costs were of revenue in  compared to in this increase in the cost of service and other revenue was primarily due to lower margins realized in europe for design  installation and project management on a number of large modular power infrastructure system sales in additionally  we continued to expand our service team to broaden the geographic regions where we have service capability as our total business grows 
gross profit the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our gross profit in total in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the following table shows gross margin by component  product or service  year over year 
year product change from prior year service and other change from prior year the increase in gross profit margin in compared to reflects the impact of an increase in product mix  weighted towards sales of our ups products and services as a percentage of our total revenue 
generally  we realize lower margins on our mis products than sales of our ups products because they include a higher proportion of third party ancillary equipment that we are not able to resell at margins that are comparable to our ups products 
a change in sales mix driven by an increase in revenues from these higher margin products as a percentage of total revenues will result in a higher gross profit for our business 
our margins were also positively impacted by lower unabsorbed overhead costs from our manufacturing operations due to higher ups product revenue 
the decrease in gross profit margin in compared to reflects the impact of an increase in sales of our modular power and it infrastructure products as a percentage of our total revenue and the decline in our ups systems revenue 
our margins were also negatively impacted by lower margins on professional services in europe related to modular power infrastructure system installation and management  and from higher unabsorbed overhead costs from our manufacturing operations due to lower ups product revenue 
our costs for manufacturing modular infrastructure products did increase faster than our ability to increase revenue from these products in  resulting in lower product margins compared to for this revenue source 
we do not expect gross profit margins to continue to increase at the same rate in as they did in  as we expect our future margins to be impacted by our geographic mix of revenues and new products that we bring to market for the first time 
research and development research and development expense primarily consists of compensation and related costs for employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  third party consulting and development activities  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy and other costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our research and development expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change percent of total revenue overall our research and development expenses were approximately million  or  higher in compared to we believe our next generation of ups product will offer greater power modularity and space efficiencies compared to our existing ups products  especially as we target the higher power market groups 
we increased headcount to support this new product development and to support new modular infrastructure products that we believe will contribute to future revenue growth for us 
it is anticipated that the new ups product line will allow improved profit margins and provide a larger addressable market for our ups systems business 
our research and development efforts in and were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology  as well as refinements and enhancements to the standardization of our modular infrastructure solution products 
research and development expenses included approximately million of stock based compensation expense in both and we anticipate our research and development expenditures in will increase compared to as we finalize development of our next generation ups products and make further investments to broaden our product portfolio

selling and marketing expenses also include approximately million of stock based compensation expense in both and we anticipate our selling and marketing expenses will decline in as we gain more productivity from the investments made in this area in and selling and marketing costs were approximately million  or  higher in compared to the increase from reflects higher salary costs as a result of an increase in headcount for our direct sales organization in the us offset  in part  by lower variable sales compensation due to our lower gross margins 
the increase also reflects increased headcount as we focus on marketing efforts on building and improving our brand and expanding our sales organization  particularly in europe and asia  to support our direct selling and channel sales activities 
we added specific sales resources to support each of our oem and it sales channels during and  which we believe contributed to the improved performance from each of these channels

during we recorded a net tax benefit due to certain tax credits that we earned 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carry forward was million and our research and development credit carry forwards were million 
we anticipate that these loss carry forward amounts may offset future taxable income that we may achieve and thus reduce future tax liabilities 
however  because of uncertainty regarding our ability to use these carry forwards and the potential limitations due to ownership changes  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
during we recorded a net tax benefit due to certain tax credits that we earned 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carry forward was million and our research and development credit carry forwards were million 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider an accounting policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or require the use of judgment at the time we make that estimate  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we could have reasonably used instead in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in these and other items could still have a material impact upon our financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations  usually due to the customer s potential insolvency 
the allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified 
in addition  the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable  but cannot yet be associated with certain customers 
the assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  risks unique to particular geographic regions  historical experience and existing economic conditions 
historically  a large portion of our sales have been made through oem channels to a few large customers  and so our credit losses have been minimal 
as we integrate additional distribution channels into our business and increase our direct sales to more and smaller customers  the risk of credit loss may increase 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we estimate inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record reserves for obsolescence or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products  the impact of new product introductions  inventory turns and specific identification of items  such as product discontinuance  damaged goods or engineering material changes 
warranty liability estimated warranty liability costs are accrued for each of our products at the time of sale 
our estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each product  including where little or no claims experience may exist 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimates  changes in our assumptions could have a material effect on our reported operating results 
our estimate of warranty liability is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for a new product can be very volatile due to factors such as product and component failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs in correcting product failures  therefore our process relies upon long term historical averages until actual data is available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
the resulting balances are then compared to current spending rates to help ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue when four criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue generating transactions generally fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment for substantially all products sold directly to customers and through distributors because title and risk of loss pass on delivery to the common carrier 
our customers and distributors do not have the right to return products 
if title and risk of loss pass at some other point in time  we recognize such revenue for our customers when the product is delivered to the customer and title and risk of loss has passed 
we may enter into bill and hold arrangements and when this occurs delivery may not be present  but other criteria are reviewed to determine proper timing of revenue recognition 
we recognize installation and service and maintenance revenue at the time the service is performed 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements emas over the life of the contracts using the straight line method  which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on certain rental programs over the life of the rental agreement using the straight line method 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue 
multiple element arrangements meas 
arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables 
our most significant meas include the sale of one or more of our cleansource ups or powerhouse products  combined with one or more of the following products design services  project management  commissioning and installation services  spare parts or consumables  and ema s 
delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide 
certain services related to design and consulting may occur prior to delivery of product and commissioning and installation typically take place within months of product delivery  depending upon customer requirements 
emas  consumables  and repair  maintenance or consulting services generally are delivered over a period of one to five years 
in certain arrangements revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of future products and services 

table of contents when arrangements outside the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue for each element when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we establish the selling price of each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we generally determine selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements 
when arrangements include an ema  we recognize revenue related to the ema at the stated contractual price on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement 
any taxes imposed by governmental authorities on our revenue producing transactions with customers are shown in our consolidated statement of operations on a net basis  that is excluded from our reported revenues 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using a fair value based recognition method 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information that can change significantly over time 
a small change in estimates used can have a relatively large impact on the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
we estimate stock price volatility based upon our historical volatility 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting  we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity at december  are our cash and cash equivalents on hand  our bank credit facilities and projected cash flows from operating activities 
if we meet our cash flow projections in our current business plan  we expect that we will have adequate capital resources to continue operating our business for at least the next months 
our business plan and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding expected revenues and future costs 
however  there are scenarios in which our revenues may not meet our projections  our costs may exceed our estimates or our working capital needs may be greater than anticipated 
further  our estimates may change and future events or developments may also affect our estimates 
any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage in and beyond or significantly affect our level of liquidity 
in august  we entered into a second amended and restated loan and security agreement the loan agreement with our existing bank  silicon valley bank svb which increased the total availability to million subject to certain borrowing bases 
this facility expanded our ability to borrow funds from us receivables to include qualifying receivables from our uk operations as well  increased our ability to use inventory as collateral  and also added an ability to borrow against purchase orders 
these additional bases of borrowing were designed to allow us to use the credit facility to fund inventory purchases in the event we received large or multiple sales orders that would require a major investment in inventory and work in progress such as our modular infrastructure solutions products  to help fund continued growth in our business and to manage our working capital requirements 
this loan facility provides for a secured revolving line of credit in an aggregate amount of up to eighty percent of the facility amount of million  or million  subject to certain borrowing bases 
in the event we have maintained unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least million with svb for at least consecutive days  which is referred to as being in a streamline period  the borrowing base formula is based on eligible accounts receivable  eligible purchase orders and eligible inventory  subject to a sublimit of million for uk accounts receivable  million for inventory and million for purchase orders 
when we are not in a streamline period  our borrowings are limited based on accounts receivable and purchase orders that svb has specifically agreed to finance and a borrowing base for eligible inventory 
we may also request that svb issue letters of credit on our behalf  of up to million  as a portion of our total loan facility 
on august   we borrowed approximately million in revolving loans  all of which was used to refinance all indebtedness owing from the company to svb under our previous credit facility 
the credit facility increases the total credit available from our previous loan facility with svb  which was million  and enables us to borrow against eligible inventory  foreign receivables and customer purchase orders in addition to eligible accounts receivable 

table of contents in august  we entered into the second amendment to second amended and restated loan and security agreement with svb the amendment which amends the second amended and restated loan and security agreement  dated as of august   by and between us and svb 
pursuant to the amendment  the maturity date of the loan facility was extended by two years  to august   unless earlier terminated by us  subject to any then applicable early termination fee 
the amendment further provides for  among other things  i adding a million sublimit under the borrowing base formula for day aged accounts receivable  ii removing eligible purchase orders from the borrowing base formula  and iii removing sublimits providing for the issuance of letters of credit and cash management services 
additionally  pursuant to the amendment  the definition of streamline period was amended such that the company will be deemed to be in a streamline period in the event that it has a liquidity ratio of greater than or equal to at all times for at least consecutive days  provided that a streamline period will automatically be in effect if the company achieves such liquidity ratio as a result of the sale of its equity securities 
further  the amendment provides for  among other things  i amending the finance charge on each eligible account financed by svb to a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus a one and one quarter percent when we are in a streamline period or b one and three quarters percent for eligible accounts other than eligible day aged accounts and two percent for eligible day aged accounts when we are not in a streamline period  and ii reducing the interest rate upon which each inventory advance accrues interest such that each advance based upon inventory accrues interest at a per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate  subject to a minimum prime rate of four percent  plus a one and one quarter percent when we are in a streamline period or b three and one half percent when the company is not in a streamline period 
finance charges and interest are payable monthly  and all principal and interest is due on the maturity date of august  however  when we are not in a streamline period  we must repay advances based on receivables when we receive the receivable that has been financed  and we must repay advances based on purchase orders within days of the date of the purchase order  together with all finance charges on such advances 
the revolving loans made to us under this loan facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
in addition  on august   active power solutions limited  a wholly owned united kingdom subsidiary of active power  entered into a guarantee and debenture with svb the guarantee and debenture  pursuant to which active power solutions limited guarantied all of the obligations of active power under the loan agreement and secured its obligations under the guarantee and debenture with a security interest on substantially all of its assets 
the loan agreement includes customary affirmative covenants for a credit facility of this size and type  including delivery of financial statements  compliance with laws  maintenance of insurance and protection of intellectual property rights 
further  the loan agreement contains customary negative covenants for a credit facility of this size and type  including covenants that limit or restrict our ability  among other things  to dispose of assets  change our business  change our ceo or cfo without replacing such person within days  have a change in control  make acquisitions  be acquired  incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  make distributions  repurchase stock  and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
the loan agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of the liquidity ratio is defined as the ratio of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities plus eligible accounts receivable to all indebtedness owed by us to svb 
we are currently in compliance with all loan covenants under the loan agreement 
the loan agreement contains customary events of default that include  among other things  non payment defaults  covenant defaults  material adverse change defaults  insolvency defaults  material judgment defaults and inaccuracy of representations and warranty defaults 
the occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of obligations under the loan agreement  in which case we must repay all loans and related charges  fees and amounts then due and payable  and our subsidiary may be required to pay any such amounts under the guarantee and debenture 
at the election of svb  upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default  finance charges or interest rates  as applicable  will increase an additional five percentage points per annum above the rate that is otherwise applicable thereto upon the occurrence of such event of default  and the collateral handling fees will increase by one half percent 
during  we borrowed amounts under this credit facility based on our short term liquidity requirements 
based on the borrowing base formula  we had an additional million available for use at december  under this credit facility 
we believe the renegotiated credit facility will enable us to extend and better utilize this credit facility and provide us greater flexibility in our working capital management 
a substantial increase in sales of our powerhouse or our modular it infrastructure solutions products or a substantial increase in ups sales may materially impact the amount of liquidity required to fund our operations 
the amount of time between the receipt of payment from our customers and our expenditures for raw materials  manufacturing and shipment of products the cash cycle for sales of our cleansource ups product can be as short as days  and is typically days 
however  the cash cycle on a mis sale can be as much as days  depending upon customer payment terms 
we intend to mitigate the financial impact of this longer cash cycle by requiring customer deposits and periodic payments where possible from our customers 
this is not always commercially feasible  and in order to increase our mis sales  we may be required to make larger investments in inventory and receivables 
these larger investments may require us to obtain additional sources of working capital  debt or equity financing in order to fund this business 

table of contents should additional funding be required or desirable  we would expect to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or equity securities  the ownership of our existing stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
significant uses of cash operating activities the following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash provided by used in operating activities in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million in cash used in operating activities was primarily related to changes in current assets and current liabilities  or our net working capital  specifically accounts receivable 
changes in our net working capital  resulted in cash used of million in  compared to million in cash used in operating activities in included approximately million in costs attributable to the departure of our chief executive officer and costs associated with closure of certain foreign operations 
as our business activity grows  we have had to finance a larger level of inventory and receivables to support this higher level of activity  particularly with our modular infrastructure solutions which have a much longer construction time than our ups business 
our receivables increased by million or during  while inventories increased million in and accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million 
these changes reflect the frequent changes in our working capital that can result in very large fluctuation in inventory  payables and receivables  even weekly  based on the large size of some of our orders 
our top five customers represented of our total revenue during in addition  as of december   our five largest receivables were of our total receivables 
as a result of this customer concentration  our failure to collect receivables from any of these customers in a timely manner could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity 
this risk may potentially increase as we sell more powerhouse products due to their higher average selling price 
we do continue to request deposits and periodic payments from large customers where commercially possible  particularly for projects with multiple deliverables 
however  the amount of such advance payments can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis  depending on the size and scope of customer orders at any point in time 
as a result  we will need to continue to focus on management of cash and working capital in in order to manage the level of funds we use in our operating activities 
cash used in operating activities was million in compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in this change in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the million increase in our operating losses and due to changes in current assets and current liabilities  or our net working capital 
cash used in operating activities in included approximately million in costs attributable to the departure of our chief executive officer and costs associated with closure of certain foreign operations 
investing activities investing activities primarily consist of sales and purchases of investments and purchases of property and equipment 
fluctuations in the sale and purchase of investments generally reflect our use of these investment funds to finance our ongoing operations 
the cash used in investing activities decreased from million in to million in as we invested less in capital expenditures in  and in we had invested in our sales and marketing programs with powerhouse demonstration units in the us  china and germany 
capital expenditures decreased in from by approximately million 
this decrease primarily related to purchasing equipment to support our sales and marketing activities that occurred in we historically invested in our manufacturing infrastructure and  because we have a production capacity in excess of our current revenue level we can substantially increase our production levels without needing to make any material capital investments 
our capital expenditures in were related to supporting the development of our new ups product 

table of contents financing activities funds provided by financing activities during reflect the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share  for proceeds net of issuances costs of approximately million 
proceeds from employee stock purchases were million in funds provided by financing activities in primarily reflect the draw on our revolving line of credit of million and proceeds from employee stock purchases 
in february  we sold approximately million shares of common stock in a firm commitment underwritten offering at a purchase price of per share  for proceeds  net of fees and expenses  of million 
contractual obligations in our day to day operations  we incur commitments to make future payments for goods and services 
these arise from entering into operating leases and as we make commitments to vendors to provide us materials and services 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other obligations our principal lease commitments consist of our leases for our corporate headquarters  engineering and administration facilities  and our global sales offices 
future uses of cash we believe that our cash and investments  projected cash flows from operations and sources of available liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our cash cycle is such that we generally have visibility two to three quarters in advance for future orders that allows us to anticipate revenues over this period of time with some degree of confidence 
however  a sudden change in business volume  positive or negative  from any of our business or channel partners or in our direct business or any customer driven events such as order or delivery deferral could significantly impact our expected revenues 
the recent global economic downturn has reduced our confidence at predicting future revenues  and even with improving economic conditions  there is still uncertainty and risk in our forecasting 
this two to three quarter window of sales visibility does provide us with some opportunity to adjust expenditures or take other measures to reduce our cash consumption if we can see and anticipate a shortfall in revenue or give us time to identify additional sources of funding if we anticipate an increase in our working capital requirements due to increased revenues or changes in our revenue mix 
a significant increase in sales  especially in our powerhouse or our modular it infrastructure solutions business  would likely increase our working capital requirements  due to the longer production time and cash cycle of sales of these products 
we expect our level of capital investments to increase approximately in compared to to support the deployment of our new products and our investments in research and development 
other factors that may affect liquidity beyond the next twelve months  our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  the market acceptance of our products  the gross profit we are able to generate with our sales  the timing and level of development funding  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the rate of expansion of our manufacturing processes  and the timing and extent of research and development projects 
although we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential acquisition or merger  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future to help accelerate our growth  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
should additional funding be required or desirable  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
entities are required to disclose both gross and net information about these instruments 
asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and taxable variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national government entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of investments that we hold and in terms of the credit quality of our investments 
because of the nature of the majority of our investments  we do not believe a decline in interest rates would have a material effect on our interest income or on the fair value of our investments 
our international sales were historically made in us dollars 
as we have increased sales in foreign markets and opened operations in multiple foreign countries  we have executed more transactions that are denominated in other currencies  primarily euro and british pounds 
those sales and expenses in currencies other than us dollars can result in translation gains and losses which have not been significant to date 
currently  we do not engage in hedging activities for our international operations other than an increasing amount of sales and support expenses being incurred in foreign currencies as a natural hedge 
however  recent volatility in currencies  particularly with the pound and euro  is increasing the amount of potential translation gains and losses and we may engage in hedging activities in the future to mitigate the risks caused by such currency volatility 
our international business is subject to the typical risks of any international business  including  but not limited to  the risks described in item a  risk factors 
accordingly  our future results could be materially harmed by the actual occurrence of any of these or other risks
