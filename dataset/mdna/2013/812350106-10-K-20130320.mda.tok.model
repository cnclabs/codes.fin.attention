actions taken included the separation of our sears hometown and outlet businesses through a rights offering transaction  which generated gross proceeds of approximately million  the partial spin off of of sears canada  the execution of various real estate transactions which generated cash proceeds of approximately million  reducing inventory by nearly billion below last year level and adjusting our promotional cadence to be more targeted  reducing our fixed cost structure by over million  and capitalizing on an opportunity to reduce risk related to our legacy pension obligation by making a voluntary offer to former employees to pay a lump sum 
we are an asset rich enterprise with substantial liquidity  unencumbered real estate and well established stand alone businesses  including lands end and sears canada 
we expect to generate at least million of additional liquidity through monetization of assets over the next months 
in addition to our asset monetizations  we currently expect to reduce peak domestic inventory by million from the level of billion at the end of the third quarter as a result of stores already or expected to be closed  initiatives underway to reduce slow moving inventory and modest productivity improvement 
this action is expected to generate million of cash after consideration of related payables 
we also expect to further reduce our fixed cost base by another million in results of operations fiscal year our fiscal year end is the saturday closest to january each year 
fiscal year consisted of weeks while fiscal years and consisted of weeks 
unless otherwise stated  references to years in this report relate to fiscal years rather than to calendar years 
the following fiscal periods are presented in this report 
fiscal year ended weeks february  january  january  holdings consolidated results holdings consolidated results of operations for  and are summarized as follows millions  except per share data revenues merchandise sales and services costs and expenses cost of sales  buying and occupancy gross margin dollars gross margin rate selling and administrative selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues depreciation and amortization impairment charges gain on sales of assets total costs and expenses operating income loss interest expense interest and investment income other income loss income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income loss attributable to holdings shareholders amounts attributable to holdings shareholders income loss from continuing operations  net of tax income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss net income loss per common share attributable to holdings shareholders diluted income loss per share from continuing operations diluted income loss per share from discontinued operations diluted weighted average common shares outstanding references to comparable store sales amounts within the following discussion include sales for all stores operating for a period of at least full months  including remodeled and expanded stores  but excluding store relocations and stores that have undergone format changes 
in addition  comparable store sales amounts include sales from sears 
com and kmart 
com shipped directly to customers and have been adjusted for the change in the unshipped sales reserves recorded at the end of each reporting period 
comparable store sales results for were calculated based on the week period ended january  as compared to the comparable week period in the prior year 
compared to net loss from continuing operations attributable to holdings shareholders we recorded a net loss from continuing operations attributable to holdings shareholders of million loss per diluted share from continuing operations and billion loss per diluted share from continuing operations for and  respectively 
our results for and were affected by a number of significant items  including non cash charges related to pension settlements and the impairment of goodwill balances and a billion non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets in our net loss from continuing operations as adjusted for these significant items was million loss per diluted share from continuing operations for and million loss per diluted share from continuing operations for the improvement in net loss for the year reflected an improvement in gross margin rate of basis points and a decrease in selling and administrative expenses  which were partially offset by a decline in gross margin dollars  given lower sales 
in addition to our net income loss from continuing operations determined in accordance with gaap  for purposes of evaluating operating performance  we use an adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda measurement as well as adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps 
adjusted ebitda is computed as net income loss attributable to sears holdings corporation appearing on the statements of operations excluding income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest  income tax expense  interest expense  interest and investment income  other income loss  depreciation and amortization and gain on sales of assets 
in addition  it is adjusted to exclude certain significant items as set forth below 
our management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate the operating performance of our businesses  as well as executive compensation metrics  for comparable periods 
adjusted ebitda should not be used by investors or other third parties as the sole basis for formulating investment decisions as it excludes a number of important cash and non cash recurring items 
while adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measurement  management believes that it is an important indicator of operating performance because ebitda excludes the effects of financings and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation costs  management considers gains losses on the sale of assets to result from investing decisions rather than ongoing operations  and other significant items  while periodically affecting our results  may vary significantly from period to period and have a disproportionate effect in a given period  which affects comparability of results 
adjusted ebitda was determined as follows millions net income loss attributable to shc per statement of operations income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax income tax expense interest expense interest and investment income other income loss operating income loss depreciation and amortization gain on sales of assets before excluded items impairment charges pension settlements closed store reserve and severance domestic pension expense transaction costs hurricane losses adjusted ebitda as defined to revenues adjusted ebitda for our segments was as follows millions kmart sears domestic sears canada sears holdings kmart sears domestic sears canada sears holdings kmart sears domestic sears canada sears holdings operating income loss per statement of operations depreciation and amortization gain on sales of assets before excluded items closed store reserve and severance impairment charges pension settlements domestic pension expense transaction costs hurricane losses adjusted ebitda as defined to revenues we also believe that use of adjusted eps improves the comparability of year to year results and is representative of our underlying performance 
we have chosen to provide this supplemental information to illustrate the results of operations giving effect to the non gaap adjustments shown in the reconciliations below  and to provide an additional measure of performance 
the following tables set forth results of operations on a gaap and as adjusted basis  as well as the impact each significant item used in calculating adjusted ebitda had on specific income and expense amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations during the years  and year ended february  millions  except per share data gaap closed store reserve  store impairments and severance gain on sales of assets transaction costs goodwill impairment pension settlements domestic pension expense gain on sale of canadian joint venture tax matters as adjusted cost of sales  buying and occupancy impact selling and administrative impact depreciation and amortization impact impairment charges impact gain on sales of assets impact operating loss impact interest and investment income impact income tax expense impact loss attributable to noncontrolling interest impact after tax and noncontrolling interest impact diluted loss per share impact year ended january  millions  except per share data gaap domestic pension expense closed store reserve  store impairments and severance mark to market losses gain on sales of assets hurricane losses goodwill impairment tax matters discontinued operations as adjusted cost of sales  buying and occupancy impact selling and administrative impact depreciation and amortization impact impairment charges impact gain on sales of assets impact operating loss impact other loss impact income tax expense impact loss from discontinued operations  net of tax impact loss attributable to noncontrolling interest impact after tax and noncontrolling interest impact diluted loss per share impact year ended january  millions  except per share data gaap domestic pension expense closed store reserve and severance mark to market losses gain on sales of real estate canadian dividend tax impact tax matters discontinued operations as adjusted cost of sales  buying and occupancy impact selling and administrative impact depreciation and amortization impact gain on sales of assets impact operating income impact other loss impact income tax expense impact income from discontinued operations  net of tax  impact income attributable to noncontrolling interest impact after tax and noncontrolling interest impact diluted income per share impact during  we recorded a million non cash charge related to pension settlements as a result of the requirement to expense the unrealized actuarial losses 
the charge had no effect on equity because the unrealized actuarial losses were already recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
accordingly  the effect on retained earnings was offset by a corresponding reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during  we recorded a billion non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets 
accounting rules generally require that a valuation reserve be established when income has not been generated over a three year cumulative period to support the deferred tax asset 
while an accounting loss was recorded  we believe no economic loss has occurred as these net operating losses and tax benefits remain available to reduce future taxes as income is generated in subsequent periods 
contributions to our pension plans remain a significant use of our cash on an annual basis 
while the company pension plan is frozen  and thus associates do not currently earn pension benefits  we have a legacy pension obligation for past service performed by kmart and sears associates 
the annual pension expense included in our financial statements related to these legacy domestic pension plans was relatively minimal in years prior to however  due to the severe decline in the capital markets that occurred in the latter part of  our domestic pension expense was million in  million in and million in during  sears canada paid million in dividends of which holdings received million

capital expenditures during included investments in online initiatives  information technology and infrastructure for stores and distribution centers 
we anticipate capital expenditure levels to be similar to levels 
it should be noted that in the normal course of business  we consider opportunities to purchase leased operating properties  as well as offers to sell owned  or assign leased  operating and non operating properties 
these transactions may  individually or in the aggregate  result in material proceeds or outlays of cash and cause our capital expenditure levels to vary from period to period 
in addition  we review leases that will expire in the short term in order to determine the appropriate action to take with respect to them 
during  we purchased one previously leased operating property for million while in  we purchased five previously leased operating properties for million 
we did not make any such purchases financing activities and cash flows net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was million in and million in  while  in  the company generated net cash from financing activities of million 
financing activities for included gross cash proceeds of million as a result of the separation of sho  which consisted of million in cash proceeds received for the sale of sho common shares and million received through a dividend from sho prior to the separation 
the proceeds received were used to fund repayments on our domestic revolving credit facility 
the financing activities in reflect an increase in debt to fund operations  and common share repurchase activity while the financing activities in reflect purchases of sears canada shares  debt repayments and common share repurchase activity  which were funded in part from billion of proceeds from our senior secured notes offering in october repayments of long term debt were million  million and million in  and  respectively

sears canada declared and paid cash dividends of canadian per common share  or approximately million canadian million us accordingly  sears canada paid million to minority shareholders in connection with these dividends 
for further information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during  we did not repurchase any of our common shares under our share repurchase program 
we did repurchase million and million of our common stock pursuant to our common share repurchase program in and  respectively 
the common share repurchase program was initially announced in and had a total authorization since inception of the program of billion 
at february   we had approximately million of remaining authorization under the program 
the common share repurchase program has no stated expiration date and share repurchases may be implemented using a variety of methods  which may include open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  block trades  accelerated share repurchase transactions  the purchase of call options  the sale of put options or otherwise  or by any combination of such methods 
uses and source of liquidity our primary need for liquidity is to fund working capital requirements of our businesses  capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes  including debt repayment  pension plan contributions and common share repurchases 
we consider ourselves to be an asset rich enterprise with substantial liquidity and financial flexibility benefiting from multiple funding resources such as our billion domestic revolving credit facility through april  an million canadian revolving credit facility through september  which may be subject to potential reserves  and billion of senior secured notes due in further  there is approximately million of remaining sears debt from the merger 
these funding resources are described in more detail below 
at february   we had liquid assets of billion consisting of cash balances of million and billion of inventory  net of payables 
the domestic revolving credit facility and senior secured notes are firmly in place for the next several years and are supported by an asset base which includes billion of inventory  owned and leased real estate assets  market leading proprietary brands such as kenmore  craftsman and diehard  and well established stand alone businesses such as lands end and sears canada 
this asset base provides us flexibility as we continue to transform our business 
we took several actions in to enhance our financial flexibility  generate liquidity and financially de risk our company 
by transforming our company to a more nimble  less asset intensive business model  we are reducing the level of risk in our operational structure and balance sheet while concurrently improving the returns on our invested capital 
the focus of this model is to win in the new retail marketplace by leveraging our stores  brands  online channels  social media assets and membership programs as an integrated retailer 
in summary  our actions positively impacted our liquidity by billion  even after consideration of the million domestic pension contribution we chose to make in september  while unlocking the value in our asset portfolio 
these actions have included the separation of our sears hometown and outlet businesses through a rights offering transaction  which generated gross proceeds of approximately million  the partial spin off of of sears canada  the execution of various real estate transactions which generated cash proceeds of approximately million  reducing inventory by nearly billion below last year level and adjusting our promotional cadence to be more targeted  reducing our fixed cost structure by over million  and capitalizing on an opportunity to reduce risk related to our legacy pension obligation by making a voluntary offer to former employees to pay a lump sum 
we expect to generate at least million in additional liquidity through monetization of assets over the next months through selective actions that are consistent with our focus on creating long term value 
the exact form and amount will depend on specific circumstances and opportunities  including market conditions 
in addition to our asset monetizations  we currently expect to reduce peak domestic inventory by million from the level of billion at the end of the third quarter as a result of stores already or expected to be closed  initiatives underway to reduce slow moving inventory and modest productivity improvement 
this action is expected to generate million of cash after consideration of related payables 
we also expect to further reduce our fixed cost base by another million in our outstanding borrowings at february  and january  were as follows millions february  january  short term borrowings unsecured commercial paper secured borrowings long term debt  including current portion notes and debentures outstanding capitalized lease obligations total borrowings domestic credit agreement during the first quarter of  we entered into a billion credit agreement the domestic credit agreement which expires in april we view this credit facility as our most cost efficient funding mechanism and therefore use it as a primary source of funding 
advances under the domestic credit agreement bear interest at a rate equal to  at the election of the borrowers  either the london interbank offered rate libor or a base rate  in either case plus an applicable margin 
the domestic credit agreement s interest rates for libor based borrowings vary based on leverage in the range of libor plus to 
interest rates for base rate based borrowings vary based on leverage in the range of the applicable base rate plus to 
commitment fees are in a range of to based on usage 
the domestic credit agreement includes a billion letter of credit sub limit and an uncommitted accordion feature that provides us the flexibility  subject to certain terms and conditions  to use the existing collateral under the credit facility to obtain an aggregate amount of up to billion in additional borrowing capacity 
the domestic credit agreement permits aggregate second lien indebtedness of up to billion  of which billion in second lien notes were outstanding at february   providing the company the capacity to issue up to an additional million in second lien indebtedness 
the domestic credit agreement is in place as a funding source for general corporate purposes and is an asset based revolving credit facility under which sears roebuck acceptance corp 
srac and kmart corporation are the borrowers 
the domestic credit agreement is secured by a first lien on most of our domestic inventory and credit card and pharmacy receivables  and is subject to a borrowing base formula to determine availability 
the domestic credit agreement limits our ability to make restricted payments  including dividends and share repurchases  under certain circumstances  including if availability under the credit facility  as defined  is less than 
it also imposes various other requirements  which take effect if availability falls below designated thresholds  including a cash dominion requirement and a requirement that the fixed charge ratio at the last day of any quarter be not less than to at february  and january   we had million and million respectively  of borrowings and million and million  respectively  of letters of credit outstanding under the domestic credit agreement 
as a result  our availability under the agreement was billion at both february  and january  the majority of the letters of credit outstanding are used to provide collateral for our insurance programs 
senior secured notes in october  we sold billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes the notes  which bear interest at per annum and mature on october  concurrent with the closing of the sale of the notes  the company sold million aggregate principal amount of notes to the company s domestic pension plan in a private placement 
the notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the company and are secured by a security interest in certain assets consisting primarily of domestic inventory and credit card receivables the collateral 
the lien that secures the notes is junior in priority to the lien on such assets that secures obligations under the domestic credit agreement  as well as certain other first priority lien obligations 
the company used the net proceeds of this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under a previous domestic credit agreement on the settlement date and to fund the working capital requirements of our retail businesses  capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
the indenture under which the notes were issued contains restrictive covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and limit the ability of the company to consolidate with or merge into  or sell other than for cash or lease all or substantially all of its assets to  another person 
the indenture also provides for certain events of default  which  if any were to occur  would permit or require the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all the then outstanding notes to be due and payable immediately 
generally  the company is required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount if the borrowing base as calculated pursuant to the indenture falls below the principal value of the notes plus any other indebtedness for borrowed money that is secured by liens on the collateral for two consecutive quarters or upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events 
the company may call the notes at a premium based on the treasury rate as defined in the indenture  plus basis points 
on september   we completed our offer to exchange the notes held by nonaffiliates for a new issue of substantially identical notes registered under the securities act of  as amended 
sears canada credit agreement in september  sears canada entered into a five year  million canadian senior secured revolving credit facility the sears canada facility 
the sears canada facility is available for sears canada s general corporate purposes and is secured by a first lien on inventory and credit card receivables 
availability under the sears canada facility is determined pursuant to a borrowing base formula based on inventory and credit card receivables  subject to certain limitations 
at february  we had no borrowings outstanding under the sears canada facility 
at january   we had approximately million million canadian of borrowings outstanding under the sears canada facility 
availability under this agreement was approximately million million canadian and million million canadian  respectively  at february  and january  the current availability may be reduced by reserves currently estimated by the company to be approximately million  which may be applied by the lenders at their discretion pursuant to the credit facility agreement 
as a result of judicial developments relating to the priorities of pension liability relative to certain secured obligations  sears canada has executed an amendment to the sears canada credit facility which would provide additional security to lenders  with respect to the company unfunded pension liability by pledging certain real estate assets as collateral thereby partially reducing the potential reserve amounts by up to million the lenders could apply 
the potential additional reserve amount may increase or decrease in the future based on estimated net pension liabilities 
letters of credit facility effective march   we agreed to terminate our million uncommitted letter of credit facility dated january  with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo in advance of the scheduled termination date of january   as no letters of credit have been issued and outstanding under the facility since may the facility was secured by a first priority lien on cash placed on deposit at wells fargo in an amount equal to of the face value of all issued and outstanding letters of credit

lampert

debt ratings our corporate family debt ratings at february  appear in the table below moody s investors service standard poor s ratings services fitch ratings b ccc ccc domestic pension plan funding contributions to our pension plans remain a significant use of our cash on an annual basis 
while the company pension plan is frozen  and thus associates do not currently earn pension benefits  the company has a legacy pension obligation for past service performed by kmart and sears associates 
during  we contributed million to our domestic pension plans 
we estimate that the domestic pension contribution will be million in and approximately million in  though the ultimate amount of pension contributions could be affected by changes in the applicable regulations as well as financial market and investment performance 
as previously reported  on july   federal legislation signed into law allows pension plan sponsors to use higher interest rate assumptions in valuing plan liabilities and determining funding obligations 
as a result of this legislation  the company domestic pension plan was within million of being funded under applicable law 
in order to reduce the risks of gross pension obligations  the company elected to contribute an additional million to its domestic pension plan on september   after which its domestic pension plan was funded under applicable law 
effective september   the company amended its domestic pension plan  primarily related to lump sum benefit eligibility  and began notifying certain former employees of the company of its offer to pay those employees pension benefit in a lump sum 
these amendments did not have a significant impact on our plan 
former employees eligible for the voluntary lump sum payment option are generally those who are vested traditional formula participants of the plan who terminated employment prior to january  and who have not yet started receiving monthly payments of their pension benefits 
the company offered the one time voluntary lump sum window in an effort to reduce its long term pension obligations and ongoing annual pension expense 
this voluntary offer was made to approximately  eligible terminated vested participants  representing approximately billion of the company total qualified pension plan liabilities 
eligible participants had until november  to make their election 
the company made payments of approximately billion to employees who made the election in december and funded the payments from existing pension plan assets 
in connection with this transaction  the company incurred a non cash charge to operations of approximately million pre tax in the fourth quarter of as a result of the requirement to expense the unrealized actuarial losses 
the charge had no effect on equity because the unrealized actuarial losses are already recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
accordingly  the effect on retained earnings was offset by a corresponding reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss

the real estate associated with full line stores was contributed to indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of sears  and then leased back to sears 
the contributed stores were mortgaged and the remic issued securities that are secured by the mortgages and collateral assignments of the store leases 
sears re and two other indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of holdings own billion par value of these mortgage backed securities 
payments to sears re on these securities are funded by the lease payments

application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  certain accounting policies require considerable judgment to select the appropriate assumptions to calculate financial estimates 
these estimates are complex and subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  evaluation of trends and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
although the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the financial statements  we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or different estimates that could have been selected would have a material effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and the considerations used in estimating amounts  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the selection of these estimates 
the following is a summary of our most critical policies and estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a listing of our other significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined primarily using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is commonly used in the retail industry 
to determine inventory cost under rim  inventory at its retail selling value is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics  which are then converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each grouping of merchandise 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based upon the year purchasing activity for each store location 
accordingly  a significant assumption under the retail method is that inventory in each group is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar turnover rates 
management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to prevent distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation 
rim inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation  as well as gross margin 
among others  two significant estimates used in inventory valuation are the level and timing of permanent markdowns clearance markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and shrinkage 
amounts are charged to cost of sales  buying and occupancy at the time the retail value of inventory is reduced through the use of permanent markdowns 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise  fashion trends and weather conditions 
in addition  inventory is also evaluated against corporate pre determined historical markdown cadences 
when a decision is made to permanently markdown merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
the timing of the decision  particularly surrounding the balance sheet date  can have a significant effect on the results of operations 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the date of the last physical inventory to the end of the year 
physical inventories are taken annually for all stores and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience  is used as the basis for the shrinkage accrual following the physical inventory 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of third party insurance and or self insurance for a number of risks including workers compensation  asbestos and environmental  automobile  warranty  product and general liability claims 
general liability costs relate primarily to litigation that arises from store operations 
self insurance reserves include actuarial estimates of both claims filed and carried at their expected ultimate settlement value and claims incurred but not yet reported 
our estimated claim amounts are discounted using a rate with a duration that approximates the duration of our self insurance reserve portfolio 
our liability reflected on the consolidated balance sheets represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred at the balance sheet date 
in estimating this liability  we utilize loss development factors based on company specific data to project the future development of incurred losses 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
these projections are subject to a high degree of variability based upon future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from the historical trends and the actuarial assumptions 
defined benefit pension plans the fundamental components of accounting for defined benefit pension plans consist of the compensation cost of the benefits earned  the interest cost from deferring payment of those benefits into the future and the results of investing any assets set aside to fund the obligation 
such retirement benefits were earned by associates ratably over their service careers 
therefore  the amounts reported in the income statement for these retirement plans have historically followed the same pattern 
accordingly  changes in the obligations or the value of assets to fund them have been recognized systematically and gradually over the associate estimated period of service 
the largest drivers of losses or charges in recent years have been the discount rate used to determine the present value of the obligation and the actual return on pension assets 
we recognize the changes by amortizing experience gains losses in excess of the corridor into expense over the associated service period 
the company actuarial valuations utilize key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
the sears holdings corporation investment committee is responsible for the investment of the assets of holdings domestic pension plan 
the investment committee  made up primarily of select members of senior management  has appointed a non affiliated third party professional to advise the investment committee with respect to the shc domestic pension plan assets 
the plan overall investment objective is to provide a long term return that  along with company contributions  is expected to meet future benefit payment requirements 
a long term horizon has been adopted in establishing investment policy such that the likelihood and duration of investment losses are carefully weighed against the long term potential for appreciation of assets 
the plan investment policy requires investments to be diversified across individual securities  industries  market capitalization and valuation characteristics 
in addition  various techniques are utilized to monitor  measure and manage risk 
for purposes of determining the periodic expense of our defined benefit plan  we use the fair value of plan assets as the market related value 
a one percentage point change in the assumed discount rate would have the following effects on the pension liability millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease effect on interest cost component effect on pension benefit obligation for and beyond  the domestic weighted average health care cost trend rates used in measuring the postretirement benefit expense are a trend rate in to an ultimate trend rate of in a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects on the postretirement liability millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease effect on total service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation income taxes we account for income taxes according to accounting standards for such taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  the company may record a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider cumulative operating income loss over the past several years 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income 
after consideration of evidence regarding the ability to realize our deferred tax assets  we established a valuation allowance against certain deferred income tax assets in and the company continues to monitor its operating performance and evaluate the likelihood of the future realization of these deferred tax assets 
at the end of  we had a state separate entity deferred tax asset of million 
in the event the company does not achieve its forecasted results for  an additional valuation allowance may be required 
in accordance with accounting standards for uncertain tax positions  we record unrecognized tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
further  we record the largest amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and  if so  the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  if any 
as further described above  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
our actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items  including changes in income tax laws  tax planning and the company forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
domestic and foreign tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves in accordance with accounting standards for uncertain tax positions 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and fully resolved 
management estimates at the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment  giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change

goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments at february  and january   we had goodwill balances of million and million  respectively  and intangible asset balances of billion at both periods 
the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment under accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets 
the majority of our goodwill and intangible assets relate to kmart acquisition of sears in march we allocated goodwill  which is defined as the total purchase price less the fair value of all assets and liabilities acquired  to reporting units at the acquisition date 
as required by accounting standards  we perform annual goodwill and intangible impairment tests in the fourth quarter and update the tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment assessments our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  using both a market approach  as well as a discounted cash flow model  commonly referred to as the income approach 
the market approach determines the value of a reporting unit by deriving market multiples for reporting units based on assumptions potential market participants would use in establishing a bid price for the unit 
this approach therefore assumes strategic initiatives will result in improvements in operational performance in the event of purchase  and includes the application of a discount rate based on market participant assumptions with respect to capital structure and access to capital markets 
the income approach uses a reporting unit projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions appropriate to each of our reporting units 
the projection uses management best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
our final estimate of fair value of reporting units is developed by weighting the fair values determined through both the market participant and income approaches  where comparable market participant information is available 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we record an impairment charge for the difference 
after performing the first step of the process  we determined goodwill recorded at reporting units within the sears canada and sears domestic segments in and  respectively  was potentially impaired 
the impairment determination was primarily driven by the combination of lower sales and continued margin pressure coupled with expense increases which led to a decline in our operating profit 
after performing the second step of the process  we determined that the total amount of goodwill recorded at these reporting units was impaired and recorded charges of million and million in and  respectively 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in either step of the goodwill impairment testing process  such as the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units  the discount rate used to discount such cash flows  or the estimated fair value of the reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or its net assets  and therefore  impact the related impairment charge 
at the annual impairment test date  the conclusion that no indication of goodwill impairment existed for the remaining reporting units would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values and or a basis point decrease in the estimated sales growth rate and or terminal period growth rate 
based on our sensitivity analysis  we do not believe that the remaining recorded goodwill balance is at risk of impairment at any reporting unit at the end of the year because the fair value is substantially in excess of the carrying value and not at risk of failing step one 
however  goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods in one or more of the reporting units to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment  retail industry or in the equity markets  which includes the market value of our common shares  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for one or more reporting units 
intangible asset impairment assessments we review indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily trade names  for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we consider the income approach when testing intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis 
we determined that the income approach  specifically the relief from royalty method  was most appropriate for analyzing our indefinite lived assets 
this method is based on the assumption that  in lieu of ownership  a firm would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this asset class 
the relief from royalty method involves two steps estimation of reasonable royalty rates for the assets and the application of these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine a value 
we multiplied the selected royalty rate by the forecasted net sales stream to calculate the cost savings relief from royalty payment associated with the assets 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value by the selected discount rate and compared to the carrying value of the assets 
we did not record any intangible asset impairment charges in  or the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in our intangible asset impairment testing process  such as the estimated future cash flows of assets and the discount rate used to discount such cash flows  could significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of an asset  and therefore  impact the related impairment charge 
at the annual impairment test date  the above noted conclusion that no indication of significant intangible asset impairment existed at the test date would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our assets to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our intangibles  a basis point decrease in the terminal period growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each intangible  or a basis point decrease in the royalty rate applied to the forecasted net sales stream of our assets 
based on our sensitivity analysis  we do not believe that the indefinite lived intangible balance is at risk of impairment at the end of the year because the fair values are substantially in excess of the carrying values 
however  indefinite lived intangible impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment  retail industry  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for one or more indefinite lived intangible asset

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face market risk exposure in the form of interest rate risk 
this market risk arises from our debt obligations 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed and variable rate funding 
all debt securities are considered non trading 
at february   of our debt portfolio was variable rate 
based on the size of this variable rate debt portfolio at february   which totaled approximately billion  an immediate basis point change in interest rates would have affected annual pretax funding costs by million 
these estimates do not take into account the effect on income resulting from invested cash or the returns on assets being funded 
these estimates also assume that the variable rate funding portfolio remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period
