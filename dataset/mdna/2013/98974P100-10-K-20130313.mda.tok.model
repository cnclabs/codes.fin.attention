we do not intend  and undertake no obligation  to update any forward looking statement 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results and reduce the value of an investment in our securities 
this report also contains forward looking statements and the following risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
our business depends upon customers using email to exchange confidential information  and a significant shift of those messages to other communication channels could impair our growth prospects and negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our customers deploy and use our products and services to easily  securely and confidentially send and receive encrypted email messages 
our business and revenue substantially depend on our current and potential customers using email to exchange sensitive information electronically 
new technologies  products  or business models that could support secure communications could be disruptive to our business 
if prospective or current customers were to send and receive sensitive information using technology or communication channels other than ours  our growth prospects and our business  financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
public key cryptography technology used in our businesses is subject to technology integrity risks that could reduce demand for our products and services and could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our business employs public key cryptography technology and other encryption technologies to encrypt and decrypt messages 
the security afforded by encryption depends on the integrity of the private key  which is predicated on the assumption that it is very difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key 
successful decryption of encrypted information  or public reports of successful decryption  whether or not true  could reduce demand for our products and services 
if new methods or technologies make it easier to derive the private key from the related public key  the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology could be impaired and our products and services could become unmarketable 
that could require us to make significant changes to our services  which could increase our costs  damage our reputation  or otherwise harm our business 
any of these events could reduce our revenues  increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
the growth of our business may require significant investment in systems and infrastructure with no guarantee of revenue  which could impair our profitability and negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
as our operations grow in size and scope  we may need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced products  services  features and functionality  while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure and pursuing reduced costs per transaction 
expanding our systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources  with no assurance that the volume of our business will increase  which could reduce our net income  deplete our cash  and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
we face strong competition  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change and converging technologies and are very competitive 
with rising demand for private and secure email communications  there is strong competition for email encryption products and services 
our business competes with products and services offered by companies such as barracuda networks  inc  cisco systems inc  echoworx  mcafee  inc  proofpoint  and sophos inc strong competition requires us to develop new technology solutions and service offerings to expand the functionality and value that we offer to our customers 
some of our competitors offer email encryption services together with products and services that we do not offer  which could make our offering less attractive by comparison 
as a result of the 
table of contents bundling of products by these competitors  it can be difficult for our customers to compare the cost of our products with competing products 
in some instances  competing products may seem to be offered by our competitors at little to no additional cost to the customer 
in addition  our competitors may develop technology solutions and service offerings that are perceived by customers as equivalent to  or having advantages over  our products and services 
competitors could capture a significant share in our markets  causing our sales and revenue to decline or grow more slowly 
barriers to entry are relatively low  and new ventures are often formed that create products competitive with our products 
competitive pressures could lead to price discounting or to increases in expenses such as advertising and marketing costs 
increased competition could also decrease demand for our products and services 
competition could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
some competitors have advantages that may allow them to compete more effectively than us  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  more extensive operations  greater name recognition  larger technical staffs  bigger product development and acquisition budgets  established relationships with more distributors and hardware vendors  and greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
these advantages might enable them independently or through alliances to develop and expand functionality of products and services faster than we can  to spend more money to market and distribute products and services than we can  or to offer their products and services at prices lower than ours 
these advantages could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
we increasingly rely on third party distributors to help us market our products and services  and our failure to succeed in those relationships could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
we plan to increase the distribution of our products and services by entering into alliances with third parties who can offer our products and services along with their own products and services 
increased reliance on third parties to market and distribute our products and services exposes us to a variety of risks 
for example  we have limited control over the sales cycles of third party distributors  which could increase the length of our sales cycle  cause our revenue to fluctuate unpredictably and make it difficult to accurately forecast our revenue 
we may not succeed in developing or maintaining marketing alliances 
companies with which we have marketing alliances may in the future discontinue their relationships with us  form marketing alliances with our competitors  or develop and market their own products and services that compete with ours 
if a significant distributor were to discontinue its relationship with us  we could experience an interruption in the distribution of our products and services and our revenues could decline 
our failure to develop  maintain and expand strategic distribution relationships could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our business depends on market acceptance of our service  and our failure to achieve and maintain market penetration could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
in order to continue to operate profitably and grow  we must achieve and maintain broad market acceptance of our products and services at a price that provides an acceptable rate of return relative to our costs 
we have been successful in selling our products and services to various high profile customers  particularly in the healthcare  financial services and government segments of our market 
the acceptance and use of our products and services by those significant customers facilitates our sales to potential customers  and an expanding base of users in the zix directory aids in our market penetration and expansion 
we must continue to evolve our technology offerings in order to achieve market acceptance of our new and existing products and services 
the loss of an influential customer or the failure to achieve sufficient market adoption could impair our ability to expand the market penetration of our products and services  or cause us to reduce or increase prices  which could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 

table of contents unfavorable economic and political environments could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed  and may continue to contribute  to slowdowns in technology and networking industries at large  as well as in the specific markets in which we operate 
if economic growth in those markets is slow  or credit is unavailable at a reasonable cost  current and potential customers may delay or reduce technology purchases  including the deployment or expansion of our products and services 
this could result in reduced sales of our products and services  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could negatively affect the cash flow of our customers and distributors  which might result in failures or delays in payments to us 
this could increase our credit risk exposure and delay our recognition of revenue 
specific economic trends  such as declines in the demand for pcs  services and other computing devices  or softness in corporate information technology spending  could have a more direct impact on our business 
if these conditions persist  spread or deteriorate further  our business  financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
our failure to keep pace with rapid technology changes could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and financial results 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent changes in customer requirements 
we must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings  to keep pace with these developments 
we must ensure that our products and services address evolving operating environments  devices  industry trends  certifications and standards 
for example  we have been required to expand our offerings for virtual computer environments and mobile environments to support a broader range of mobile devices 
we also may need to develop products that are compatible with new operating systems while remaining compatible with existing  popular operating systems 
our business could be harmed by our competitors announcing or introducing new products and services that could be perceived by customers as superior to ours 
we spend considerable resources on technology research and development  but our research and development resources are more limited than many of our competitors 
our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis  to keep pace with rapid industry  technological or market changes or to gain customer acceptance for our new and existing products and services  such as mobile device data protection  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 
if our products do not work properly  our business  financial condition and financial results could be negatively affected and we could experience negative publicity  declining sales and legal liability 
we produce complex products that incorporate leading edge technology  including both hardware and software  that must operate in a wide variety of technology environments 
software may contain defects or bugs that can interfere with expected operations 
there can be no assurance that our testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects prior to the product being introduced  which might decrease customer satisfaction with our products and services 
the product reengineering cost to remedy a product defect could be material to our operating results 
our inability to cure a product defect could result in the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product or service  negative publicity  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  lost revenue and increased expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 
the infrastructure supporting our business may suffer capacity constraints and business interruptions that could cause us to lose customers  increase our operating costs and could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our business depends on our providing our customers reliable  real time access to our data centers and networks 
customers will not tolerate a service hampered by slow delivery times  unreliable service levels  service outages  or insufficient capacity 
system capacity limits or constraints arising from unexpected increases in our volume of business or network traffic could cause interruptions  outages or delays in our services  or deterioration in their performance  or could impair our ability to process transactions 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage of our network or to timely increase capacity to accommodate increased traffic on our 
table of contents network 
system delays or interruptions may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers or other third parties  which could result in our losing customers and revenues  or incurring liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 
our business depends substantially on our data center facilities  and their unreliability or unavailability for a significant period could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
much of the computer and communications hardware upon which our businesses depend is located in our data center facilities in dallas and austin  texas and in the united kingdom 
our data centers might be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  cyber attacks  earthquakes  terrorist attacks  hostilities or war or other events 
computer viruses  equipment failure  denial of service attacks  and similar disruptions affecting the internet or our systems might cause service interruptions  delays and loss of critical data  and could prevent us from providing our services 
problems affecting our data center operations or our networks could result in loss of revenues  increased expenses  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of resources  injury to our reputation  liability and increased costs 
we do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
outages or problems with systems and infrastructure supplied by third parties could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our business relies on third party suppliers of the telecommunications infrastructure 
we use various communications service suppliers and the global internet to provide network access between our data centers  our customers and end users of our services 
if those suppliers do not enable us to provide our customers with reliable  real time access to our systems  we may be unable to gain or retain customers 
these suppliers periodically experience outages or other operational problems as a result of internal system failures or external third party actions 
though our products generally tolerate isolated supplier failures  multiple supplier outages or problems could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
the security of our networks and data centers is critical to our business and a breach of security through a cyber attack or otherwise could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
we are dependent on our networks and datacenters to provide our products and services 
due to the nature of the products and services we provide and the sensitive nature of the information we collect  process  store  use and transmit  we may face cyber attacks that attempt to penetrate our networks and datacenters 
to reduce the risk of a successful cyber attack  we have implemented significant physical and logical security measures to detect  identify and mitigate threats as well as to monitor for and respond to potential breaches and incidents 
despite these security measures  our networks and datacenters may remain vulnerable to cyber attack 
cyber attacks and other breaches of security at our datacenters and networks could cause negative publicity  interruption of our services  damage to our reputation  unauthorized disclosure of our customers confidential or proprietary information including personally identifiable information  disclosure of our intellectual property  loss of customers  lost revenue and increased expense including potentially indemnification or warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 
problems with enforcing our intellectual property rights or using third party intellectual property could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and copyrights to establish and protect intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in our products and services 
these intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights might be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary information may not prevent its misuse  theft or misappropriation 
competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that 
table of contents inappropriately incorporate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology into their products 
competitors may hire our former employees who may misappropriate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology 
some jurisdictions may not provide adequate legal protection of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology 
we may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our services  and we could be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which could be disruptive and expensive to our business 
we may have to defend against claims that we or our customers are infringing the rights of third parties in patents  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property 
if we acquire technology to include in our products from third parties  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties to verify the origin and ownership of such technology 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
even unmeritorious claims brought against us or our customers may harm our reputation and customer relationships  may cause us to incur significant legal and other fees to defend  and may have to be settled for significant amounts 
infringement claims could require us to develop non infringing services or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements 
our business  financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to develop non infringing technology or license technology on commercially reasonable terms 
we may face risks from using open source software that could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
like many other software companies  we use open source software in order to take advantage of common industry building blocks and to add functionality to our products quickly and inexpensively 
open source software license terms could adversely affect our intellectual property rights in our products that include open source software 
we could lose the right to use the open source code if we fail to comply with the license obligations 
using open source code could also cause us to inadvertently infringe third party intellectual property rights or require us to publically disclose proprietary information 
we have processes and controls in place that are designed to address these risks and concerns  but we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products nor that our process or controls will be sufficient to mitigate all risk in this regard 
we may fail to recruit and retain key personnel  which could impair our ability to meet key objectives 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales  and marketing personnel 
changes in key personnel may be disruptive to our business 
it could be difficult  time consuming and expensive to replace key personnel 
integrating new key personnel may be difficult and costly 
volatility  lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  many of whom are compensated  in part  based on the performance of our stock price 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives 
any of these impairments related to our key personnel could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our usage of personal information  and inadvertent exposure of confidential or personal information  could cause us to violate data privacy laws or lose customers and could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
we collect  process  store  use and transmit large amounts of personally identifiable information about individuals  such as personal healthcare or financial information 
our handling of these types of data is subject to confidentiality agreements with our clients and handling of this data is increasingly subject to regulation around the world 
these regulations may result in conflicting requirements and may change over time 
our business could be materially adversely affected if legal restrictions on the use of personally identifiable information are expanded or are interpreted in ways that conflict with our business practices or increase our costs 
unauthorized disclosure of personal or other confidential information including due to a cyber attack or other failure by us to comply with data privacy requirements could subject us to significant penalties  damages  remediation and other expenses  and damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 

table of contents governmental restrictions on the sale of our products and services in non us markets could negatively affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
exports of software solutions and services using encryption technology such as ours are generally restricted by the us government 
although we have obtained us government approval to export our service to almost all countries  the list of countries to which we and our distributors cannot export our products and services could be expanded in the future 
in addition  some countries impose restrictions on the use of encryption solutions and services such as ours 
the cost of compliance with us and other export laws  or our failure to obtain governmental approvals to offer our products and services in non us markets  could affect our ability to sell our products and services and could impair our international expansion 
we face a variety of other legal and compliance risks 
if we or our distributors fail to comply with applicable law and regulations  we may become subject to penalties  fines or restrictions that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
our financial performance could be erratic and asset impairments could negatively affect our financial condition and financial results 
although we generate adequate cash flow from operations to pay our expenses and we expect to remain profitable  we may not continue to produce sufficient cash flow or profits 
our balance sheets reflect goodwill relating to our email encryption business  as well as other assets 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and other assets to determine if their values have been impaired  which could require us to recognize a non cash charge to earnings 
any of these circumstances could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and financial results 
the market price of our securities could be volatile and our securities may decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition to stock price volatility related to our business performance  our stock price may fluctuate due to events affecting our industry or our competitors  as well as general economic and political conditions or otherwise 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in general  and such fluctuations were often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these fluctuations have and will continue to affect smaller capitalized technology companies like us 
any of these circumstances could cause our securities to decline in value 
exercises of options for our common stock would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and could negatively affect the value of our securities 
we have a significant number of outstanding options  including options held by our employees 
the exercise of options  and the resulting issuance of additional shares of our common stock  would substantially dilute the ownership interests and voting rights of our current shareholders 
issuance or sales of those additional shares could cause our securities to decline in value 
our issuances of additional debt or equity securities could dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and could negatively affect the value of our securities 
we may issue additional debt or equity securities  including convertible debt  common and convertible preferred stock  and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock 
those securities could be issued in public or private transactions  at or below the then prevailing market price of our securities 
in addition  we may grant our employees shares of our common stock and options to purchase those shares 
our issuance of additional securities could substantially dilute the ownership interests and voting rights of our current shareholders 
issuance or sales of those additional shares could cause our securities to decline in value

overview we are a leader in providing secure email encryption in a saas model 
our email encryption service delivers information in a secure manner  enabling the use of internet based email for the safe delivery of sensitive information  especially for customers in the healthcare  finance  insurance  and government sectors 
a core competency is our ability to deliver this complex service offering with a high level of availability  reliability  integrity and security 
we are encouraged by results and attribute our success to continuing efforts to build a solid and predictable business based on our successful recurring revenue subscription business model 
additionally  our results indicate that we are transitioning to become a part of mainstream demand for email encryption as data security and integrity issues continue to make headline news 
we are also benefiting from a trend toward the use of powerful cloud based offerings along with the growing need for regulatory compliance 
for  we reported record revenue driven by continued growth in our email encryption business 
the company s operating income for was million  a decrease of million over prior year  resulting from growth in revenue that was offset by increased sg a spending and additional investments in r d 

table of contents our net income in included a tax benefit of million resulting from a decrease in the our deferred tax valuation allowance 
the overall decrease to our valuation allowance was million  of which million was due to operations and offset current tax expense 
the remaining million was due to a partial reversal of the remaining valuation allowance and recorded as tax benefit 
this compares to a decrease in our deferred tax asset valuation and resulting tax benefit of million in net income for and excluding the impact of this tax benefit was million and million  respectively 
strategy and focus areas the company s email encryption subscription service continued to grow in by adding new customers while retaining a high percentage of existing customers 
our subscription model initially required large up front investment to establish the service  but over time  the recurring subscription and transaction fees  and incremental costs to add new users are relatively low and have exceeded the fixed set up costs 
over the course of we continued to make investments to strengthen our email encryption services through the development of a number of significant portfolio upgrades 
in addition to continuing to invest in growing the strength and efficiency of our core encryption technologies  we added two factor authentication and message recall capabilities to our base zixport feature portfolio 
operationally  our success is primarily dependent upon the following key metrics new subscriptions termed new first year orders nfyo for the email encryption service  retention of subscribers to the email encryption service  total orders includes nfyo s  second and third years on multi year orders and renewals  and  our ability to increase business volume with minimal cost increases 
known trends regarding these key metrics and their implication on our current and future capital requirements are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
there are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to achieve these key metrics 
our continued growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of our products and services

risk factors for more information on the risks relative to our operations and future prospects 
discontinued operations on december   zix corporation completed the previously announced wind down of its e prescribing business and discontinued operating this line of business 
this business had previously been reported as a segment 
the wind down of this business entailed the fulfillment of existing contracts 
assets used by this segment  primarily business computer servers  were compatible with the remaining business  email encryption  and were therefore absorbed by our remaining business 
as a result  no gain or loss on disposal of assets was incurred 
prior to the completion of the wind down  this business line had been a reportable segment 
the following table summarizes the components of the income from discontinued operations presented in our statement of operations for there was no activity relating to e prescribing in or in thousands revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses income before income taxes unless specifically noted  the financial information contained and discussed in our md a is that of our continuing operations only 

table of contents revenue revenue increased by in compared with our revenue growth was driven by our successful subscription model that continues to yield steady additions to the subscriber base coupled with a high rate of renewing existing customers 
operating margins for the year ended december   our gross profit of million increased compared to this increase was primarily driven by increased revenue 
our operating income of million decreased million over the prior year  primarily due to increased r d and sg a expenses 
net income for included a tax benefit of million resulting from a decrease in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the overall decrease to our valuation allowance was million  of which million was due to operations and offset current tax expense 
the remaining million was due to a partial reversal of the remaining valuation allowance and recorded as a tax benefit in net income for included an million reduction to the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance  also recorded as a tax benefit in net income for and excluding the impact of this tax benefit was million and million  respectively

the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results were to differ from these estimates materially  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we consider accounting policies to be critical when they require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and when different estimates that our management reasonably has used have a material effect on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies included the following revenue recognition income taxes valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets stock based compensation costs 
table of contents for additional discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we develop  market  and support applications that connect  protect and deliver information in a secure manner 
our services can be placed into several key revenue categories where each category has similar revenue recognition traits email encryption subscription based services  various transaction fees and related professional services 
the majority of our revenues generated are through a combination of direct sales and a network of resellers and other distribution partners 
under all product categories and distribution models  we recognize revenue after all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
when we are engaged in a complex product deployment  customer acceptance may have to occur before the transaction is considered complete 
in this situation  no revenue is recognized until the customer accepts the product 
discounts provided to customers are recorded as reductions in revenue 
our email encryption service is a subscription service 
providing this service includes delivering subscribed for software and providing secure electronic communications and customer support throughout the subscription period 
our email subscribers generally execute multiple year contracts that are irrevocable and non refundable in nature and require annual  up front payments 
subscription fees received from customers are initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription period

income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset will be realized on future federal or state income tax returns 
at december   we provided a valuation allowance against a significant portion  million  of our accumulated us deferred tax assets 
this significant valuation allowance reflects our historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income sufficient to utilize net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
our total deferred tax asset not subject to a valuation allowance is valued at million  and consists of million for federal net operating loss carryforwards  million relating to temporary timing differences between gaap and tax related expense  million relating to us state income tax credits  and million related to alternative minimum tax credits 
if us taxable income increases from its current level in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
alternatively  should our future income decrease from current levels  a resulting increase to all or a part of this valuation allowance could also have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
the company previously recorded a thousand tax contingency liability related to tax year  and that amount and the specifics therein have remained unchanged except for currency translation adjustments 
as of december   the gross amount of our unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of the thousand tax liability and thousand in other uncertain positions in  was approximately thousand 
because the statute of limitations expired on the returns associated with these uncertain positions  this contingency was reversed in  creating a positive impact on our operating results 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we account for the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets after classifying intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with finite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
goodwill was million  or of total assets for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our goodwill is not being amortized  but we do evaluate the goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to  versus the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based on the company s market capitalization  which is based on the outstanding stock and market price of the stock 
impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we have evaluated our goodwill and determined no impairment is required 
stock based compensation we have non qualified stock options outstanding to employees  directors  and third parties under various stock option plans 
the plans require the exercise price of options granted under these plans to equal or exceed the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
the options  subject to termination of employment  generally expire ten years from the date of grant 
employee options typically vest pro rata and quarterly over three years 
option grants to employees  officers and directors frequently contain accelerated vesting provisions upon the occurrence of a change of control  as defined in the applicable option agreements 
we use the straight line amortization method for recognizing stock option compensation costs 
our share based awards include stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units rsu s 
the weighted average grant date fair value of awards of restricted stock and rsu s is based on quoted market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant

variance vs 
in thousands revenues our growth model seeks to continually add new users to the subscriber base  while at the same time retaining a high percentage of existing subscribers whose subscriptions are up for renewal 
across all periods presented  revenue increases were driven primarily by strong performances in our three core vertical sales markets healthcare  finance and government and other non core markets 
additionally  sales continued from a wide base of distributors new first year orders derived from our value added resellers  oem and third party distribution channels for was of the total nfyos compared to in and in we measure additions to the subscriber base by nfyo  which is defined as the portion of new orders that are expected to be recognized into revenue in the first twelve months of the contract 
nfyos are summarized in the table below year ended december  in thousands new first year order value our go to market selling strategy seeks primarily multiple year subscription contracts with the fees paid annually at the inception of each year of service 
as a result  a high percentage of customers subscribe to the email encryption service for a three year term versus a one year term 
we expect this preference for a longer contract term by a high percentage of our customers to continue in  as we have priced our services in a manner that encourages longer term contractual commitments from customers 
our list pricing has remained generally consistent during the periods shown above 
we have continued to experience some market pricing pressure resulting in additional discount percentages off our list price during this period 
there are no assurances that potential increased competition in this market or other factors will not result in future price erosion 
price erosion  should it occur  could have a dampening effect on the revenue derived from our new orders 
revenue outlook with our continued focus on sectors such as healthcare  financial services  insurance  government  and expansion into other non core markets  along with the increased use of indirect oem distribution and value added reseller channels  we expect to increase our new first year orders in and fuel a continued increase in our year over year revenue

income taxes our company or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states and in the canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions 
we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
the company s income tax benefit for  and of million  million  and million  respectively  represents refundable us alternative minimum tax  us research and development credits  non us taxes payable related to the operations of the company s canadian subsidiary established in late  state income taxes  and reversals of a portion of the company s historical valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider available evidence  including past earnings  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
at december   the company partially reserved its us net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of future taxable income sufficient to utilize net loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
the portion of the company s deferred tax asset not reserved was million 
the majority of this unreserved portion related to million us net operating losses nols because we believe the company will generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these nols prior to their expiration 
the remaining balance consists of million relating to temporary timing differences between gaap and tax related expense  million relating to us state tax income credits  and million related to alternative minimum tax credits 
we have determined that utilization of existing net operating losses against future taxable income is not limited by section of the internal revenue code 
future ownership changes  however  may limit the company s ability to fully utilize its existing net operating loss carryforwards against any future taxable income 

table of contents if we begin to generate additional us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our current estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing a greater or lesser amount of our deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance required 
adjusting our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that an additional portion of our deferred tax assets will or will not be realized 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  or accounting principles  including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement applicable to all income tax positions 
this includes the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income

new accounting standards testing for goodwill impairment in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
under the new guidance  entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
otherwise  further testing would not be needed 
the new guidance does not change how goodwill is calculated  nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment or between tests if events or circumstances warrant 
the amended guidance became effective for us for january  this new guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements
