item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to our consolidated financial statements and other information included elsewhere in this annual report  including risk factors disclosed in part i  item a 
the following information contains forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report 
executive summary on february   we acquired complete  which substantially expanded the size and scope of our business 
given the substantial nature of this acquisition and its impact on our financial performance  comparisons between our results for years ended december  and may not be meaningful 
on february   we sold a derrick barge and on march   we sold the assets of our former marine segment  consisting of a fleet of liftboats 
the operating results from these dispositions have been included within discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
we believe we are a leading provider of specialized oilfield services and equipment 
as a result of the complete acquisition  we significantly added to our geographic footprint in the us land market area 
we now offer a wider variety of products and services throughout the life cycle of an oil and gas well 
the acquisition of complete greatly expanded our ability to offer more products and services related to the completion of a well prior to full production commencing  as well as enhancing our full suite of intervention services used to carry out wellbore maintenance operations during a well s producing phase 
we serve energy industry customers who focus on developing and producing oil and gas worldwide 
our operations are managed and organized by both business units and geomarkets offering products and services within various phases of a well s economic lifecycle  including end of life services 
business unit and geomarket leaders report to executive vice presidents  and we report our operating results in four segments drilling products and services  onshore completion and workover services  production services  and subsea and technical solutions 
given our history of growth and long term strategy of expanding geographically  we provide supplemental segment revenue information in three geographic areas us land  gulf of mexico  and international 
overview of our business segments prior to the fourth quarter of  we reported our operating results in two segments drilling products and services and subsea and well enhancement 
during the fourth quarter of  we revised our internal reporting structure that we use in determining how to allocate resources 
as a result  we divided our previous segment identified as subsea and well enhancement segment into three segments that better reflect our product and service offerings throughout the life cycle of a well onshore completion and workover services  production services  and subsea and technical solutions 
accordingly  all prior period segment disclosures have been recast to reflect this change in reporting structure 
the drilling products and services segment remains unchanged 
the drilling products and services segment is capital intensive with higher operating margins relative to our other segments as a result of relatively low operating expenses 
the largest fixed cost is depreciation as there is little labor associated with our drilling products and services businesses 
the financial performance is primarily a function of changes in volume rather than pricing 
in  approximately of segment revenue was derived from us land market areas down from in  while approximately of segment revenue was from the gulf of mexico market area up from in and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas down from in 
premium drill pipe accounted for more than of revenue in this segment  while bottom hole assemblies and accommodations each accounted for more than of this segment s revenue in 
table of contents the onshore completions and workover services segment consists primarily of services used in the completion and workover of oil and gas wells on land 
these services include pressure pumping  well service rigs and fluid management services 
in  virtually all of this segment s revenue was derived from us land market areas and was comprised of products and services from the legacy complete businesses 
demand for these services in the us land market area can change quickly and is primarily dependent on the number of land wells drilled and completed 
given the cyclical nature of activity drivers in the us land market areas coupled with the high labor intensity of these services  operating margins can fluctuate widely depending on supply and demand at a given point in the cycle 
in an effort to lessen some of the volatility  we try to contract for three year terms as much as of our pressure pumping horsepower that is used for horizontal well fracturing 
in addition  the volumes of produced water that we permanently dispose of for our customers typically generate stable revenue streams as they are primarily a by product of ongoing oil and gas production from existing and mature wells 
pressure pumping is the largest service offering in this segment  representing more than of segment revenue in  while well service rigs and fluid management each account for more than of segment revenue 
the production services segment consists of intervention services primarily used to maintain and extend oil and gas production during the life of a producing well  and specialized pressure control tools used to manage and control pressure throughout the life of a well 
the services provided are labor intensive and margins can fluctuate based on how much customers spend on enhancing existing oil and gas production from mature wells 
in  approximately of segment revenue was derived from the us land market area up from in  while approximately of segment revenue was from the gulf of mexico market area down from in and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas up from in 
coiled tubing is the largest service offering in this segment  accounting for more than of segment revenue in the significant growth in us land revenue  as well as some of the growth in international revenue  in can be attributed to the complete acquisition as legacy complete businesses offered cased hole wireline  coiled tubing and remedial pumping in the us land market area  as well as coiled tubing in mexico 
the subsea and technical solutions segment consists of products and services that generally address customer specific needs and include offerings such as pressure control services  completion tools and services  subsea construction  end of life services  production handling arrangements  the production and sale of oil and gas  and marine technical services 
in  approximately of segment revenue was derived from the us land market area down from in  while approximately of segment revenue was from the gulf of mexico market area down from in and approximately of segment revenue was from international market areas up from in 
given the project specific nature associated with several of the service offerings in this segment and the seasonality associated with shallow water gulf of mexico activity  revenue and operating margins in this segment can have significant variations from quarter to quarter 
pressure control and associated services represent the largest service offering in this segment  accounting for more than of segment revenue in market drivers and conditions the oil and gas industry remains highly cyclical and seasonal 
activity levels are driven primarily by traditional energy industry activity indicators  which include current and expected commodity prices  drilling rig counts  well counts  well completions and workover activity  geological characteristics of producing wells which determine the number and intensity of services required per well  oil and gas production levels  and customers spending allocated for drilling and production work  which is reflected in our customers operating expenses or capital expenditures 

table of contents historical market indicators are listed below change change worldwide rig count us international commodity prices average crude oil west texas intermediate natural gas henry hub estimate of drilling activity as measured by average active drilling rigs based on baker hughes incorporated rig count information 
excludes canadian rig count 
as indicated by the table above  the major activity drivers were mixed in as compared with the average number of drilling rigs working in the us was virtually unchanged  while the international rig count increased 
the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil decreased while the average price of henry hub natural gas decreased 
the following table compares our revenues generated from major geographic regions for the years ended december  and in thousands 
we attribute revenue to countries based on the location where services are performed or the destination of the rental or sale of products 
revenue change us land gulf of mexico international total in  our us land revenue increased more than times to  million as a result of the complete acquisition  which contributed  million in the onshore completions and workover segment and million in the production services segment 
us land revenue from the drilling products and services segment increased despite a flat rig count environment 
the growth was attributable to the increase in the number of rigs drilling horizontal wells in the us land market areas  which resulted in higher utilization of new assets added through capital expenditures 
us land revenue in the subsea and technical solutions segment increased primarily due to increased demand for pressure control services and completion tools and services 
within individual product and service lines  the largest increases in the us land market area were in pressure pumping  fluid management  well services rigs and coiled tubing primarily resulting from the complete acquisition 
in addition  we experienced strong growth in premium drill pipe and accommodations 
our gulf of mexico revenue increased to million as this market benefitted from a strong rebound in deepwater drilling activity as well as shallow water intervention and decommissioning activity 
the drilling products and services segment  which has significant deepwater gulf of mexico exposure  experienced a increase in revenue from the gulf of mexico 
downhole drilling tools such as bottom hole assemblies and premium drill pipe experienced the most growth 
the subsea and technical solutions segment revenue from the gulf of mexico increased  while the production services segment revenue from the gulf of mexico grew 

table of contents our international revenue increased to million due primarily to the complete acquisition  which accounted for of the increase as a result of its coiled tubing business in mexico 
as a result  the production services segment revenue from international market areas increased 
the subsea and technical solutions segment revenue from international market areas increased due to increased demand for pressure control services and subsea construction  while the drilling products and services segment experienced a increase in international revenue primarily due to increased rentals of downhole drilling tools 
industry outlook based on current expectations of the industry s indicators of demand commodity prices and drilling rig counts  we believe there will be lower activity in us land markets and increasing demand in the gulf of mexico and international market areas 
during the last half of  we believe utilization and pricing declined for many of our completion oriented services such as pressure pumping  fluid management and coiled tubing due to weak prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids  and a reduction in the pace of spending by our customers 
while we anticipate that customer spending levels in the us land market areas will be at or near the same levels achieved in  we don t anticipate a full recovery in pricing in the short term 
as a result  cost of service as a percentage of revenue is likely to be higher in for several products and services that have a high concentration of us land revenue 
in the gulf of mexico  we anticipate continued growth in deepwater activity as well as steady or increasing activity for our shallow water services 
our gulf of mexico operations generally focus on three areas drilling support  production enhancement  and decommissioning or end of life services 
our exposure to drilling activity is primarily in the drilling products and services segment 
we anticipate that our financial performance from the gulf of mexico in this segment will gradually increase as the number of permits for deep water drilling increases  resulting in more rigs drilling in than in the shallow water gulf of mexico  most of our revenue is related to production enhancement and end of life services 
we anticipate that demand for products and services participating in these market segments will remain stable 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of our consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item of this annual report  contains a description of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to business combinations  long lived assets  goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition  long term contract accounting  self insurance  and oil and gas properties 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
business combinations purchase price allocation 
we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
we use all available information to estimate 
table of contents fair values  including quoted market prices  the carrying value of acquired assets  and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist in fair value determination of property  plant and equipment  inventories  identifiable intangible assets  and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when the fair value of those assets is less than their respective carrying amount 
fair value is measured  in part  by the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels and operating performance 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
assets are grouped by subsidiary or division for the impairment testing  which represent the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
we have long lived assets  such as facilities  utilized by multiple operating divisions that do not have identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing for these long lived assets is based on the consolidated entity 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with authoritative guidance related to goodwill and other intangibles  which requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our annual testing of goodwill is based on carrying value and our estimate of fair value as of december we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our business segments using various cash flow and earnings projections discounted at a rate estimated to approximate the reporting units weighted average cost of capital 
we then compare these fair value estimates to the carrying value of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the rate is enacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding the customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age 
table of contents of all receivable balances against those balances that do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition 
our products and services are generally sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with customers that include fixed or determinable prices 
we recognize revenue when services or equipment are provided and collectability is reasonably assured 
we contract for services either on a day rate or turnkey basis  with a majority of our projects conducted on a day rate basis 
we rent products on a day rate basis  and revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized when the title to the equipment has transferred to the customer 
long term contract accounting for revenue and profit loss recognition 
a portion of our revenue is derived from long term contracts 
for contracts that meet the criteria under the authoritative guidance related to construction type and production type contracts  we recognize revenues on the percentage of completion method  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
it is possible there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and profitability for contracts currently in process 
these adjustments could  depending on the magnitude of the adjustments  materially  positively or negatively  affect our operating results in a reporting period 
to the extent that an adjustment in the estimated total contract cost impacts estimated profit of the contract  the cumulative change to revenue and profitability is reflected in the period in which this adjustment in estimate is identified 
the accuracy of the revenue and estimated earnings we report for fixed price contracts is dependent upon the judgments we make in estimating our contract performance and contract revenue and costs 
self insurance 
we self insure  through deductibles and retentions  up to certain levels for losses under our insurance programs 
as a result of our growth  we have elected to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance levels 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
we obtain actuarial reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of internal estimates for losses related to workers compensation  auto liability and group medical on an annual basis 
our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
oil and gas properties 
our subsidiary  wild well control inc wild well  has oil and gas properties as well as the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
wild well follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its investment in oil and gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful exploratory wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip developmental wells  including unsuccessful developmental wells  are capitalized 
other costs such as geological and geophysical costs and the drilling costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and allocated to leasehold costs and well costs 
leasehold and well costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent oil and gas reserves of the field 
we estimate the third party market price to plug and abandon wells  abandon pipelines  decommission and remove platforms and clear sites  and use that estimate to record our proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  we will utilize the services of our subsidiaries to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by our subsidiaries  all recorded intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 
if the liability exceeds or is less than our incurred costs  the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 

table of contents oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on a field by field basis whenever indicators become evident 
we use our current estimate of future revenues and operating expenses to test the capitalized costs for impairment 
in the event net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded based on the present value of expected future net cash flows over the economic lives of the reserves 
discontinued operations 
we classify assets and liabilities of a disposal group as held for sale and discontinued operations if the following criteria are met management  with appropriate authority  commits to a plan to sell a disposal group  the asset is available for immediate sale in its current condition  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions to complete the sale have been initiated  the sale is probable  the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price  and actions required to complete the plan of sale indicate it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan of sale will occur or that the plan will be withdrawn 
once deemed held for sale  we no longer depreciate the assets of the disposal group 
upon sale  we calculate the gain or loss associated with the disposition by comparing the carrying value of the assets less direct costs of the sale with the proceeds received 
in the consolidated statements of income  we present discontinued operations  net of tax effect  as a separate caption below net income from continuing operations 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenue was  million and our net income from continuing operations was million  or diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
for the year ended december   our revenue was  million and our net income from continuing operations was million  or diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
included in the results for was of million of acquisition related costs  million of loss on early extinguishment of debt  and million of gain on the sale of our equity method investment

revenue from our gulf of mexico market increased approximately over the same period in as the market experienced a strong rebound in deepwater drilling activity 
revenue in our us land market area increased approximately for the year ended december  over the same period in revenue generated from our international market areas increased approximately for the year ended december  over the same period in this increase was primarily related to increased rentals of bottom hole assemblies  drill pipe and specialty tubulars 
onshore completion and workover services segment revenue for our onshore completion and workover services segment was  million for the year ended december  cost of services was of revenue in there was no revenue recorded in as products and services that comprise this segment were acquired in as a result of the complete acquisition 
on a pro forma basis  revenue for in this segment was  million  an approximate increase over pro forma revenue of  million  primarily due to utilization of new assets put in service in through capital expenditures 
however  pro forma cost of services increased to of pro forma segment revenue in from in as overall utilization and pricing declined during the second half of production services segment revenue for our production services segment was  million for the year ended december   an approximate increase over cost of services increased to of segment revenue from in the complete acquisition contributed approximately million of revenue as we added coiled tubing  cased 
table of contents hole wireline and remedial pumping assets to our existing asset base 
in addition  we achieved strong growth in hydraulic workover and snubbing services as well as pressure control tools 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue was higher in due to a combination of lower utilization and pricing in the us land market area for coiled tubing 
pro forma revenue in was  million  an approximate increase over pro forma revenue of  million due to increases in coiled tubing activity during the first half of and new assets placed into services in through capital expenditures 
pro forma cost of services increased to of pro forma revenue as compared with in as a result of additional infrastructure required to support assets placed into service and an increase in certain labor and maintenance expenses 
subsea and technical solutions segment revenue for our subsea and technical solutions segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate increase from cost of services decreased slightly to of segment revenue in from in the primary factors driving the revenue growth were increased demand for pressure control services  subsea construction and completion tools and products 
higher margin pressure control work was offset by lower than anticipated margin for marine technical services  which was primarily related to delays in completing and deploying an oil containment system for a customer in alaska 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of complete  which added approximately million in depreciation  amortization and accretion expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased within our drilling products and services segment by million  or  and within our subsea and technical solutions group by million  or due to capital expenditures 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in increases in general and administrative expenses are largely attributable to our acquisitions  which added approximately million in general and administrative expenses  inclusive of acquisition and incremental stock based compensation expenses 
additionally  we continue to build our infrastructure to support our growth 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include operating results for both the derrick barge and liftboats with related assets that were sold in the first quarter of losses from discontinued operations  net of tax  were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  in  the company recorded a pre tax loss of approximately million  inclusive of approximately million of goodwill in connection with the sale of the derrick barge 
additionally  the loss includes a million pretax loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the sale of our former marine segment 
in  we recorded a pretax reduction in value of the marine segment s assets of approximately million which included a write down of property and equipment of approximately million and a write down of goodwill of approximately million 
also included in the loss from discontinued operations are gains on sale of liftboats  net of tax  of approximately million for the year ended december

revenue cost of services change change drilling products and services production services subsea and technical solutions total the following discussion analyzes our results on a segment basis 
drilling products and services segment revenue for our drilling products and services segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate increase from cost of services decreased slightly to of segment revenue in from in the increase in revenue for this segment is primarily related to rentals of our accommodation units  drill pipe and specialty tubulars  specifically in our us land market area 
revenue in our us land market area increased approximately for the year ended december  over the same period in revenue generated from our international market areas increased approximately for the year ended december  over the same period in this increase was primarily related to increased rentals of drill pipe and specialty tubulars 
revenue from our gulf of mexico market area remained essentially flat due to the lingering effects of the macondo oil spill in april production services segment revenue from our production services segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate increase from cost of services decreased to of segment revenue in from in this segment s revenue increased in each of our market areas 
revenue in our us land market area increased approximately primarily related to increased demand for pressure control tools  coiled tubing  cased hole wireline  and remedial pumping services 
revenue in our international market areas increased approximately primarily attributable to hydraulic workover and snubbing services 
revenue in our gulf of mexico market area increased approximately related to electric line and snubbing and hydraulic workover services 
the increase in this market area was partially offset by decreases in demand for pressure control tools and remedial pumping services 

table of contents subsea and technical solutions segment revenue from our subsea and technical solutions segment was million for the year ended december   an approximate increase from cost of services increased to of segment revenue in from in revenue in our us land market area increased approximately  primarily attributable to well control and engineering services 
revenue in our international market area increased approximately primarily attributable to increased demand for well control and subsea intervention projects  along with the acquisition of our completion tools and services business in august revenue in our gulf of mexico market area decreased by approximately based on a decline in work on a large scale decommissioning project  along with decreased revenue from well control projects 
these decreases were partially offset by stimulation and sand control revenue as a result of the acquisition of our completion tools and services business in depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million for the year ended december  from million in depreciation and amortization expense increased within our drilling products and services and production services segment by million  or  and million  or  respectively  due to capital expenditures 
depreciation and amortization expense increased within our subsea and technical solutions segment by million  or  due to the acquisition of our completion tools and services business in august  higher utilization of certain assets used in subsea intervention projects  as well as capital expenditures 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in  which included approximately million of management transition expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to the acquisition of our completion tools and services business  increased bonus and compensation expense due to our improved performance  as well as additional infrastructure to enhance our growth 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include operating results for both the derrick barge and liftboats with related assets that were sold in the first quarter of losses from discontinued operations  net of tax  were million for the year ended december  as compared to losses of million for the year ended december  in  we recorded a pre tax reduction in value of assets of approximately million which included a write down of property and equipment of approximately million and a write down of goodwill of approximately million 
in  we recorded a pre tax reduction in value of assets totaling million in connection with liftboat components primarily related to two partially completed liftboats that we concluded were impractical to complete 
also included in the loss from discontinued operations are gains on sale of liftboats  net of tax  of approximately million and approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of  million as compared to million in our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  debt service  and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and available borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  compared to million as of december  as of december   approximately million of our cash balance was held in foreign jurisdictions 
cash balances held in foreign jurisdictions could be repatriated to the us  however  they would be subject to us federal income 
table of contents taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
the company has not provided us income tax expense on earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because it expects to reinvest the undistributed earnings indefinitely 
we spent  million of cash on capital expenditures during the year ended december  approximately million was used to expand and maintain our drilling products and services equipment inventory  and approximately million  million and million was spent to expand and maintain the asset bases of our onshore completion and workover  production services and subsea and technical solutions segments  respectively 
on february   in connection with the complete acquisition  we amended our bank credit facility to increase the revolving borrowing capacity to million from million  and to include a million term loan 
the principal balance of the term loan is payable in installments of million on the last day of each fiscal quarter  which began on june  any amounts outstanding on the revolving portion and the term loan of the credit facility are due on february  as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving portion of the credit facility and approximately million of letters of credit outstanding  which reduce our availability under this portion of the credit facility 
the average amount outstanding during the year ended december  was approximately million with a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
the maximum amount outstanding during the year ended december  was million  as this amount was borrowed for the acquisition of complete in february as of february   we had approximately million outstanding under the revolving portion of the credit facility along with approximately million of letters of credit outstanding  which reduces our borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of the credit facility 
the balance outstanding under the revolving portion of our credit facility is primarily related to a us income tax payment of million made in january borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our principal domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  create liens or incur additional indebtedness 
in august  we redeemed million  or  of the principal amount of our million unsecured senior notes due at of face value 
this redemption resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million related to the writeoff of a portion of debt acquisition costs and note discount

description thereafter long term debt  including estimated interest payments capital lease obligations  including estimated interest payments decommissioning liabilities  undiscounted operating leases vessel construction other long term liabilities total we currently believe that we will spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  during we believe that our current working capital  cash generated from our operations  and availability under our credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our identified capital projects 
in may  we signed a contract for construction of a compact semi submersible vessel 
this vessel is designed for both shallow and deepwater conditions and will be capable of performing subsea construction  inspection  repairs and maintenance work  as well as subsea light well intervention and abandonment work 
the vessel is expected to be delivered in late we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing the scope of our services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions

in the unlikely event of default on any remaining decommissioning liabilities by the obligor  our total maximum potential obligation under these guarantees is estimated to be approximately million  net of the contractual right to receive payments from third parties  which is approximately million  as of december  the total maximum potential obligation will decrease over time as the underlying obligations are fulfilled
