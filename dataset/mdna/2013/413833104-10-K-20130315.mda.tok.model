background and overview we incorporated under the laws of the state of new york in august in  we completed an ipo 
in  we divested all of our assets except otisville biotech  inc  and became a financial services company with the investment in otisville as the initial focus of our business activity 
in  we registered as an investment company under the act  commencing operations as a closed end  non diversified investment company 
in  we elected to become a bdc subject to the provisions of sections through of the act 
we believe we provide five core benefits to our shareholders 
first  we are an established firm with a positive track record of investing in venture capital backed companies 
second  we provide shareholders with access to disruptive science enabled companies  particularly ones that are enabled by nanotechnology that would otherwise be difficult to access or inaccessible for most current and potential shareholders 
third  we have an existing portfolio of companies at varying stages of maturity that provide for a potential pipeline of investment returns over time 
fourth  we are able to invest opportunistically in a range of types of securities to take advantage of market inefficiencies 
fifth  we provide access to venture capital investments in a vehicle that  unlike private venture capital firms  is both transparent and liquid 
we are an early stage  active investor in transformative companies 
we make venture capital investments in companies enabled by multi disciplinary  scientific innovations  particularly those enabled by nanotechnology and microsystems 
we define venture capital investments as the money and resources made available to privately held and publicly traded small businesses with exceptional growth potential 
nanotechnology and microsystems are technologies that allow for the characterization  design  manipulation and manufacture of materials and systems on the molecular and micro levels  respectively 
we believe companies that leverage scientific innovations  particularly those at the nanoscale  are emerging as leaders in their respective industry sectors 
these industry sectors include life sciences  energy and electronics 
innovations within each sector often have very different  sometimes unexpected  origins 
the knowledge of core domains within each of these industry sectors can be augmented by exposure to the adjacent or even entirely white field multi disciplinary technology domains including nanoscale materials  novel analytical instrumentation and manufacturing tools  ultrafast computational and modeling capabilities  high function mobile devices  high speed wireless data transfer and high density  long lasting and renewable sources of energy 
our investment team has the ability to identify and invest in such domains 
we believe that as the impact of scientific innovation  and particularly nanotechnology  occurs  our portfolio companies are well positioned to profit and that we will see investment returns as a result 
we consider a company to fit our investment thesis if the company employs  or intends to employ  science enabled technologies  particularly those that we consider to be at the microscale or smaller  and if the employment of that technology is material to its business plan 
by making these investments  we seek to provide our shareholders with a portfolio of venture capital investments that address a variety of industries  markets and products leveraging science related innovations  particularly in nanotechnology and microsystems 
industry sector overview life sciences we classify companies in our life sciences portfolio as those that address problems in life sciences related industries  including biotechnology  agriculture  advanced materials and chemicals  diagnostics  healthcare  bioprocessing  water  industrial biotechnology  food  nutrition and energy 
we historically referred to our life sciences portfolio using the term healthcare 
we believe life sciences is a more appropriate term to describe this portion of our portfolio owing to the scope of applications for life sciences related companies and technologies outside of traditional healthcare markets  including agriculture  food and industrial biotechnology 
we are living through an unprecedented rate of change in our understanding of biological systems and the ability to manipulate the fundamental building blocks of nature 
novel  rapidly maturing discovery  characterization  analysis  control and manufacturing techniques can have profound impact on life sciences and related industries that can be addressed through the understanding of biological systems and the ability to manipulate the fundamental building blocks of nature 
trends generating disruptive investment opportunities include healthcare budgets are out of balance globally  with the aging population jeopardizing the financial viability of the leading economies of the world 
life sciences innovations in diagnostics  treatment and monitoring of disease must simultaneously reduce cost and improve the quality of life  continuing global growth in population and in improvements in quality of life substantially increase demand for raw materials  water  food and energy 
this demand cannot be adequately met with conventional methods of manufacturing  generation  mining or harvesting 
biological pathways are becoming economically viable and ecologically preferable for production  utilization  and disposal remediation  and the ubiquity of data and internet access  while stationary and increasingly mobile  enable handheld devices to become a natural access point for communication and data sharing between healthcare service providers and their patients 
soon  they could be acting as diagnostic and treatment companions too 
we continue to believe we are positioned well to take advantage of today s growth markets within life sciences having been early investors in many of these markets 
we believe our initial investments in single cell analysis enumeral  three dimensional biology champions oncology  metabolomics metabolon  synthetic carbohydrates ancora  oncolytic viruses biovex  which was acquired by amgen in  solid state ph sensors senova  positioned us well to capture the growth of commercial interest in personalized medicine  industrial biotechnology  vaccines and molecular diagnostics 
we also believe we have an emerging pipeline of companies that are developing solutions for growth markets that exist today or may develop in future years such as long read genomic analysis opgen and agricultural products from the microbiome agbiome  formerly aginnovation 
we discuss these companies in more detail in the section below titled  new investments in we also have a number of portfolio companies that address life sciences related sectors as a secondary industry focus of their businesses 
these related industries and portfolio companies include environmental remediation absmaterials  chemical and fuel production cobalt and solazyme  nanofabrication for life sciences related tools molecular imprints and non destructive  soft tissue analysis xradia 
our interest in life sciences will continue to be multi disciplinary 
for example  analytical  modeling and data acquisition techniques accelerated drastically in the first decade of the century  rapidly increasing the development of new diagnostic testing 
we believe that this trend will continue owing to successful migration of well developed semiconductor manufacturing and computational technologies into life sciences applications 
there have been numerous examples  such as gene sequencing  metabolomics or bioinformatics  where transition from matter to data resulted in positive shifts in performance of the underlying machinery 
furthermore  as moore s law scaling in the semiconductor manufacturing industry is expected to continue for at least another two decades  we expect to see continuing migration of the novel techniques and computational capabilities into life sciences applications 
the rapid development of internet and mobile computing represents another vector of developing innovation for the life sciences market 
the move from central lab to hand held devices changes how diagnostic information is used in decision making for patient care 
real time information can be shared and analyzed by one or more physicians immediately at the point of care in a single visit rather than requiring multiple  sometimes lengthy delays and follow up visits 
the next step in this direction will be sensing networks and life sciences functionality embedded into always on devices 
these devices will generate substantial amounts of data that will require significant computing capability and new software algorithms for analyzing and using the data to derive suggestions for clinical diagnosis and  potentially  treatment options for consideration by healthcare providers 
the data generated by these devices will need to be transferred at high speed  often wirelessly  to data centers where such analysis could take place 
while a number of technologies exist today that can address some of these needs  substantial improvements in speed  cost and capability are required for the realization of all of the capabilities desired by healthcare providers 
such needs present significant opportunity for innovations such as those targeted by us 
manufacturing techniques are also undergoing rapid changes  and the cross pollination is bi directional 
biological and life sciences inspired techniques are penetrating natural resources and mining industries 
water treatment  usage and utilization and fermentation technologies are influencing other unrelated verticals 
synthetic biology promises to impact the oil derived chemical industry 
membrane science is impacting food production  ore enrichment and waste remediation 
as such  our portfolio companies will often produce products and or services that are applicable to multiple industry sectors 
we sometimes address this cross sector nature by indicating a primary and secondary industry sector focus for some of our portfolio companies  as applicable 
the table below lists the equity focused companies in our portfolio as of december   and the equity focused companies that were formerly in our portfolio that target life sciences related needs as either the primary or secondary focus of those businesses and the year in which we initially invested in each company current life sciences portfolio companies past life sciences portfolio companies abs materials  inc alliance pharmaceutical corporation agbiome  llc formerly aginnovation  llc biovex group  inc ancora pharmaceuticals inc chlorogen  inc

xradia  inc nanogram devices corporation nanomix  inc neurometrix  inc pharmaceutical peptides  inc phoenix molecular  inc polyremedy inc sciquest  inc tetravitae bioscience  inc the percent of life sciences investments in our portfolio has been increasing over the past ten years 
approximately percent of our initial investments since  and all of our investments in  were in companies addressing needs in the life sciences 
our life sciences companies demonstrate progress and growth through different mechanisms depending on their respective businesses 
businesses that provide services  such as metabolon  generate revenues from the commercial sale of these services 
businesses that develop and sell products  such as senova  generate revenues from the sale of those products 
businesses that enter into partnerships for discovery and development of therapeutics  vaccines and diagnostics  such as ensemble  enumeral  mersana and champions oncology  may generate revenue from upfront fees  milestone payments and royalties on sales of approved products 
businesses that endeavor to advance a therapeutic  diagnostic or vaccine product through clinical trials may not generate revenue until an approved product is on the market  if ever 
progress for these types of companies can be measured by progress through clinical trials 
energy we classify companies in our energy portfolio as those that seek to improve performance  productivity or efficiency  and to reduce environmental impact  waste  cost  energy consumption or raw materials 
energy is a term used commonly to describe products and processes that solve global problems related to resource constraints 
the term  cleantech  is also used commonly in a similar manner 
we are experiencing record levels of demand for energy  chemicals and resources that are crucial components of the global economy 
this demand coupled with energy security concerns and volatility of commodity prices  leads to trends that yield disruptive investment opportunities 
these trends include identification and extraction of natural resources is becoming more of a science and less of an art 
such a shift in approach is driven  in part  by the need to manage the significant costs associated with energy related projects  particularly in remote areas  and the availability of new methods of generating  analyzing and using data that was heretofore not available 
o recovery of resources is occurring in exceedingly remote areas and from increasingly more difficult sources to access as the traditional easy to access sources of these resources are being drained of supply 
this trend is leading to the need for new extraction technologies 
o new techniques for extraction of natural gas are increasing the supply and lowering the cost of this resource 
natural gas powered devices can be more efficient and less polluting than petroleum powered devices 
advances in distribution could enable natural gas to replace petroleum in certain applications 
governments and industry worldwide are looking for new and cleaner forms of energy 
this has increased interest in the ability to produce chemicals and fuels from renewable resources 
governments  corporations and individuals worldwide seek ways to translate significant amounts of data generated by today monitoring capabilities into ways to optimize use of energy and resources 
we expect that the foundation of products and services that address the trends above and other energy related trends will be interdisciplinary 
tools that are commonly used for inspection and certification of electronic devices could find use in analyzing soil and rock samples in oil and gas exploration 
organisms that are used to manufacture therapeutics could find use in the producing of renewable chemicals and fuels 
these multidisciplinary products and services will seek to improve performance  productivity and efficiency and to reduce environmental impact  waste  cost  energy consumption or raw materials 
we believe innovations in energy markets include new approaches to production the term production  is defined here to indicate the process of combining one or more individual components into a final product 
a final product made using a process can be quite diverse and include a physical device eg  a solar panel  battery or solid state coolers  a chemical eg  butanol  ethanol or biodiesel  or even a component that produces light 
although many existing processes are capable of producing these types of products in large quantities and of high quality  they each suffer from various inefficiencies that could be overcome using new approaches and solutions 
new materials the physical properties of a product are defined primarily by the materials that comprise it 
in some cases  these properties limit the ability of a product to meet the needs of the industry 
the semiconductor industry is a classic example of this phenomenon with its efforts to reduce the dimensions of the transistors to allow them to pack more transistors into a device to increase its speed while decreasing the size of the die itself to reduce manufacturing costs 
as this reduction in size occurs  the silicon dioxide insulating layer in the transistors begins to leak electrons  which results in a reduction in performance and an increase in energy use 
at dimensions of less than approximately nm  the insulating behavior of silicon dioxide degrades in performance  and the transistor cannot function properly 
this example of reduced performance as a layer of a traditional material is reduced in thickness is a common problem of traditional materials that limits product development and advancement in a number of industries 
this and other inherent limitations in the properties of traditional materials often force companies to use underperforming devices that present difficulties such as environmental hazards  low energy efficiency or incompatible form factors because alternative technology is not available 
new advanced materials permit the development of new products that overcome inherent limitations of existing technology and approaches 
we continue to believe we are positioned well to take advantage of today s growth markets within energy 
we have been early investors in many of these markets 
our initial investments in renewable chemicals and biofuels solazyme  produced water remediation produced water absorbents  light emitting diodes bridgelux and alternative sources for high intensity light laser light engines positioned us well to participate in the growth of these respective industries 
additionally  a number of our energy portfolio companies completed recent liquidity events 
solazyme completed a successful ipo in the second quarter of  raising over million 
dupont acquired innovalight in the third quarter of asahi kasei acquired crystal is in the fourth quarter of we also have a number of portfolio companies that address energy related needs as a secondary focus of their respective businesses 
these companies are targeting needs such as low power memory nantero and adesto and low power  uncooled infrared image sensors sionyx 
the table below lists the equity focused companies in our portfolio as of december   and the equity focused companies that were formerly in our portfolio that target energy related needs as either the primary or secondary focus of those businesses and the year in which we initially invested in each company current energy portfolio companies past energy portfolio companies absmaterials  inc cordex petroleums  inc

produced water absorbents  inc tetravitae bioscience  inc 
sionyx  inc solazyme  inc nasdaq szym ultora  inc many of our energy portfolio companies are generating commercial revenues and or have entered into partnerships and joint development agreements with large corporations 
electronics we classify companies in our electronics portfolio as those that address problems in electronics related industries  including semiconductors  telecommunications and data communications  metrology and test and measurement 
we believe macroeconomic and microeconomic trends  including global connectivity  demand for increasing bandwidth owing to pervasiveness of electronics in daily life  the desire to see not just hear  the need for real time availability of data and demand for more functionality driven by increasing global prosperity  create attractive investment opportunities in electronics 
we believe innovations in electronics include new methods of production continuation of moore s law allows for exponential increases of the number of integrated circuits in semiconductor devices 
new materials new materials enable unique capabilities  performance and form factors in electronic devices 
new forms of computation new methods of solving equations and other problems that would be difficult or impossible with standard digital computing techniques 
we continue to believe we are positioned well to take advantage of today s growth markets within electronics having been early investors in many of these markets 
we believe our initial investments in non volatile memory nantero and adesto  transparent conductors cambrios  image sensors sionyx  integrated photonics neophotonics  waterproofing hzo and metrology xradia  positioned us well to capture the growth of commercial interest in smartphones and tablet computers with touchscreens  the exponential increase in demand for bandwidth for data and telecommunications  and the demand for non destructive imaging capabilities in a variety of industries 
we also believe we have an emerging pipeline of companies that are developing solutions for growth markets that exist today or may develop in future years such as high performance computing enabled by quantum mechanics d wave systems and radio frequency identification and near field communication devices enabled by printed electronics kovio 
we also have a number of portfolio companies that address electronics related needs as a secondary focus of their respective businesses 
these companies are targeting needs such as high efficiency  high color gamut led displays nanosys  high energy density storage devices contour and ultora and novel  electrically driven  solid state sensors senova 
the table below lists the equity focused companies in our portfolio as of december   and the equity focused companies that were formerly in our portfolio that target electronics related needs as either the primary or secondary focus of those businesses and the year in which we initially invested in each company current electronics portfolio companies past electronics portfolio companies adesto technologies corporation agile materials and technologies  inc bridgelux  inc cma group  inc

voice control systems  inc zia laser  inc as of february   we no longer hold any shares of neophotonics corporation 
many of our electronics portfolio companies are generating commercial revenues and or have entered into partnerships and joint development agreements with large corporations 
maturity of current equity focused venture capital portfolio our equity focused venture capital portfolio is composed of companies at varying maturities facing different types of risks 
we have defined these levels of maturity and sources of risk as early stage technology risk  mid stage market risk and late stage execution risk 
early stage companies have a high degree of technical  market and execution risk  which is typical of initial investments by venture capital firms  including us 
these companies often require substantial development of their technologies before they begin introducing products to market 
mid stage companies are those that have overcome most of the technical risk associated with their products and are now focused on addressing the market acceptance for their products 
for those companies developing therapeutics or medical devices  the focus is on bringing their products through the first phases of clinical trials 
late stage companies are those that have determined there is a market for their products  and they are now focused on sales execution and scale 
late stage  life sciences companies are typically generating revenue from the commercial sale of one or more products or  in the case of therapeutic or medical devise focused life sciences companies  are in phase iii clinical trials  which are the pivotal trials before a possible fda approval and commercial launch of a product 
we seek to create a portfolio of companies that enables consistent flows of potential liquidity events in multiple industries in three sectors  life sciences  energy  and electronics  which can be monetized as these companies mature 
we believe a portfolio of companies focused on a diverse set of industries reduces the potential impact of cyclicality of any one industry 
our current portfolio is comprised of companies at varying stages of maturity in a diverse set of industries within three sectors 
as our portfolio companies mature  we seek to invest in new early and mid stage companies that may mature into mid and late stage companies 
this continuous progression creates a pipeline of investment maturities that may lead to future sources of positive contributions to net asset value per share as these companies mature and potentially experience liquidity and exit events 
this diversity of industries and our pipeline of investment maturities are demonstrated by the distribution of our current early and mid stage portfolio companies that primarily address needs in the sectors shown in the table below 

tpgjpg 
the interdisciplinary nature of science based inventions enables our portfolio companies to address needs in multiple sectors rather than being confined to addressing needs in one sector 
as such  many of our companies can adjust their business foci to address needs in a secondary sector should opportunities in the company s primary sector decrease in number or magnitude 
we discuss this attribute in more detail in the section above titled  industry sector overview 
we expect some of our portfolio companies to transition between stages of maturity over time 
this transition may be forward if the company is maturing and is successfully executing its business plan or may be backward if the company is not successfully executing its business plan or decides to change its business plan substantially from its original plan 
transitions backward are commonly accompanied by an increase in non performance risk  which reduces valuation 
we discuss non performance risk and its implications on value below in the section titled valuation of investments 
during the fourth quarter of  we transitioned absmaterials from a mid stage company to an early stage company owing to a change in its primary target market during the quarter 
portfolio company revenue we currently have companies in our equity focused venture capital portfolio that generate revenues ranging from nominal to significant from commercial sales of products and or services  from commercial partnerships and or from government grants 
in aggregate  our portfolio companies had approximately million in revenue in  a percent increase from aggregate revenue of approximately million  a percent increase from aggregate revenue of approximately million and a percent increase from aggregate revenue of million 
new investments in in  we made two new investments 
in both cases  we invested more dollars and took ownership positions that are more meaningful than we had done historically 
this is a strategy we implemented over the past few years 
during  we invested million in opgen  inc opgen is an innovator in providing rapid  accurate  dna analysis products and services 
the company s proprietary whole genome mapping technology provides high resolution  whole genome maps for sequence assembly and validation  strain typing and comparative genomics 
the company is dedicated to positively influencing individual healthcare outcomes  advancing scientific research and enhancing public health by delivering precise  actionable information and results to customers in the life sciences and healthcare communities 
opgen s customers include genomic research centers  public health agencies  bio defense organizations  academic institutions  clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies 
in december  we made a million investment in agbiome  llc 
we are a founding investor in agbiome 
agbiome is a provider of early stage research and discovery for agriculture and is utilizing the crop microbiome to identify products that reduce risk and improve yield 
early stage  active investing despite rapidly expanding research and development budgets  publications and patents covering life sciences  the number of early stage venture capitalists investing in science enabled companies has decreased substantially 
this has resulted in decreased competition for attractive investment opportunities and increased attractive pricing available to investors in those opportunities 

tpgjpg 
includes data through september  source lux research  inc according to data from lux research  between and  seed series a venture capital investments  as a percentage of all financings in the type of investments made by us  fell from a high of percent to approximately percent 
owing to financial conditions  many venture capital firms have substantially reduced or ceased completely participation in the financing of early stage  companies  particularly in the industry sectors in which we invest 
many of these firms are now focused on financing later stage  and or  in the case of life sciences related companies  therapeutics focused  clinical stage companies 
despite this shift to later stage investing  over the previous decade  research by palo alto venture science  a venture capital firm that employs analytical models for investing in early stage companies  showed that the risk of later stage investing is not significantly less than early stage investing 
over the previous decade  there was a percent failure rate in early rounds yielding a times money multiple versus a percent failure rate in later rounds yielding a times multiple 
we believe the money multiple will increase as more funds have exited early stage investing 
the shift of many venture capital firms away from early stage investing has created opportunity for us 
innovation continues to accelerate  and with a dearth of funding available  high quality investment opportunities at attractive valuations are prevalent 
additionally  the turmoil in the venture capital industry has made start up companies more interested in engaging with strategic corporations as partners and investors 
our ability to bring early stage financing and strong corporate partnering early in the development process could be perceived as valuable by potential portfolio companies and may be of particular benefit in investment opportunities that become competitive 
corporate partnerships are increasingly important to us we have historically built our portfolio companies through a combination of investment from other venture capital firms  high net worth individuals and other sources of equity capital  partnerships and investments from corporations and federal funding 
the venture capital industry is undergoing contraction that is reducing the amount of capital available for investment  particularly in the types of companies that we invest in 
the us government is reducing spending  and the partisan gridlock creates substantial uncertainty around the availability of federal funding 
corporations  on the other hand  have substantial amounts of cash  know how and a need to harness innovation to drive future growth 
as such  we believe that corporate involvement is evolving to become more critical for the success of early stage companies in the years ahead 
in addition to the points discussed above  two other factors are driving this evolution 
first  corporations and the public markets have become less willing to take technology  scale and manufacturing risk 
corporations and the public markets often are requiring more mature companies with proven scale and customers prior to an ipo or acquisition 
second  the time period between investment and exit over the past decade has lengthened considerably 
this extension of time results in the need for start up companies to secure larger amounts of capital from dilutive and non dilutive sources than was historically required before being acquired or seeking capital in ipos 

tpgjpg 
at the same time  facing a depleting pool of acquisition targets and the necessity to supplement downsized internal research and development operations  large corporations are investing actively in venture capital backed companies 
early stage entrepreneurs and investors have proven effective at company formation  early intellectual property strategy  building management teams  and characterizing  reproducing and establishing base line processes 
the challenges for early stage companies have been in scale and manufacturing and end market access 
thus  active corporate involvement is becoming increasingly valuable  especially as technology becomes more complex  to overcome these challenges 
the combination of rapid development capabilities of small companies  and manufacturing expertise and channel access of large corporations has become exceedingly powerful for all entities involved in such efforts 
we are actively working to increase our engagement with corporate partners as we believe that working closely with corporations will permit us to identify and to diligence technologies more efficiently and effectively  gather market intelligence that these corporations have from their involvement in the industry  gain a better perspective on the dynamic competitive landscape  better understand integration challenges of bringing a new technology to this industry  and provide insights into the requirements of scale and manufacturing while we work actively with our portfolio companies to ready the technology for launch 
we also believe it will help these young companies identify and pursue markets for products where there is a proven demand 
investment objective and strategy our principal investment objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation by making equity focused venture capital investments in companies that we believe have exceptional growth potential 
therefore  a significant portion of our current venture capital investment portfolio provides little or no income in the form of dividends or interest 
current income is a secondary investment objective 
we seek to reach the point where future growth is financed through reinvestment of our capital gains from our venture capital investments and where current income offsets significant portions of our annual expenses during periods of time between realizations of capital gains on our investments 
we also plan to implement a strategy to grow assets under management and generate current income by raising one or more third party funds to manage 
it is possible that we will invest our capital alongside or through these funds in portfolio companies 
these funds may be focused on specific sectors such as life sciences  energy and electronics that are enabled by scientific breakthroughs  including nanotechnology 
it is also possible these funds will also invest in companies in each of these sectors that are not directly enabled by nanotechnology 
there is no assurance when and if we will be able to raise such fund s or  if raised  whether they will be successful 
we have discretion in the investment of our capital to achieve our objectives 
our venture capital investments are made primarily in equity related securities of companies that can range in stage from pre revenue to generating positive cash flow 
these businesses tend to be thinly capitalized  unproven  small companies that lack management depth  have little or no history of operations and are developing unproven technologies 
these businesses may be privately held or publicly traded 
we historically have invested in equity securities of these companies that are generally illiquid due to restrictions on resale and to the lack of an established trading market 
we refer to our portfolio of investments in equity and equity related securities in later sections of the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a as our equity focused portfolio of investments 
we have historically  from time to time  taken advantage of opportunities to generate near term cash flow by investing in non convertible debt securities of small businesses 
these businesses tend to be generating cash or have near term visibility to reaching positive cash flow 
we refer to our portfolio of investments in non convertible debt in later sections of the md a as our venture debt portfolio of investments 
while we have historically made venture debt investments  we currently plan to focus our efforts on equity focused investments and on raising and managing one or more third party funds 
we are both early stage and long term investors 
we seek to identify investment opportunities in industries and markets that will be growth opportunities three to seven years from the date of our initial investment 
we expect to invest capital in these companies at multiple points in time subsequent to our initial investment 
we refer to such investments as follow on investments 
our efforts to identify and predict future growth industries and markets rely on patient and deep due diligence in nanotechnology enabled innovations developed at universities and corporate and government research laboratories  and the examination of macroeconomic and microeconomic trends and industry dynamics 
we believe it is the early identification of and investments in these growth opportunities that will lead to investment returns for our shareholders  growth of our net assets  and capital for us to invest in tomorrow s growth opportunities 
involvement with portfolio companies the act requires that bdcs offer to make available significant managerial assistance to portfolio companies 
we are actively involved with our portfolio companies through membership on boards of directors  as observers to the boards of directors and or through frequent communication with management 
as of december   we held at least one board seat or observer rights on of our equity focused portfolio companies percent 
we may hold two or more board seats in early stage portfolio companies or those in which we have significant ownership 
we may transition off of the board of directors to an observer role as our portfolio companies raise additional capital from new investors  as they mature or as they are able to attract independent members who have relevant industry experience and contacts 
we also typically step off the board of directors upon the completion of an ipo 
our observer rights at board of directors meetings commonly cease when companies complete an ipo 
we have not held a board seat or observer rights at either solazyme  inc  or neophotonics corporation since each company completed an ipo in may and february  respectively 
we may be involved actively in the formation and development of business strategies of our earliest stage portfolio companies 
this involvement may include hiring management  licensing intellectual property  securing space and raising additional capital 
we also provide managerial assistance to late stage companies looking for potential exit opportunities by leveraging our relationships with the banking and investment community and our knowledge and experience in running a micro capitalization publicly traded business 
investments and current investment pace since our investment in otisville in through december   we have made a total of equity focused venture capital investments

from august through december   all of our initial equity focused investments have been in science enabled companies commercializing or integrating products enabled by nanotechnology or microsystems 
from august through december   we have invested a total before any subsequent write ups  write downs or dispositions of  in these companies 
we currently have equity focused companies in our portfolio that have yet to complete liquidity events eg  ipo or m a transactions 
at december   from first dollar in  the average and median holding periods for these investments were years and years  respectively 
historically  as measured from first dollar in to last dollar out  the average and median holding periods for the investments we have exited were years and years  respectively 
the following is a summary of our initial and follow on equity focused investments in nanotechnology companies from january   to december  we consider a round led to be a round where we were the new investor or the leader of a group of investors in an investee company 
typically  but not always  the lead investor negotiates the price and terms of the deal with the investee company 
investments in our equity focused portfolio of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies total incremental investments   no 
of new investments no 
of follow on investment rounds no 
of rounds led average dollar amount initial    average dollar amount follow on   importance of availability of liquid capital private venture capital funds are structured commonly as limited partnerships with a committed level of capital and finite lifetime 
capital is called from limited partners to make investments and pay for expenses of running the firm at various points within the lifetime of the fund 
for each initial investment  the fund must reserve additional capital for follow on investments at later stages of the life of the portfolio companies 
these follow on investments are required because often venture backed portfolio companies in areas in which we invest  whether privately held or publicly traded  operate with negative cash flow for lengthy periods of time 
in general  the cumulative total of initial invested capital and reserves cannot exceed the committed level of capital of the fund 
our strategy for investing capital is similar to this approach in some respects 
we make initial investments in privately held and publicly traded companies and project the amount of capital that may be required should the company mature successfully 
these projections  equivalent to the reserves of private venture capital funds  are reviewed weekly by management  are updated frequently and are a component of the data that guide our decisions on whether to make new and follow on investments 
as a publicly traded  internally managed venture capital company  our cash used to make investments and pay expenses is held by us and not called from external sources when needed 
accordingly  it is crucial that we operate the company with a substantial balance of liquid capital for this reason and for four additional reasons 
we manage the company and our investment criteria and pace such that our projected needs for capital to make new and follow on investments do not exceed the total of our liquid investments 
although we use best efforts to predict when this capital will be required for use in new and follow on investments  we cannot predict with certainty the timing for these investments 
we would be unable to make new or follow on investments in our portfolio companies without having substantial liquid resources of capital available to us 
venture capital firms traditionally invest beside other venture capital firms in a process called syndication 
the size of the fund and the amount of capital reserves available to syndicate partners is often an attribute that potential co investors consider when deciding on syndicate partners 
as we do not have committed capital from limited partners  we believe we must have adequate available liquid capital on our balance sheet to be able to have access to high quality deal flow 
we rarely commit the total amount of cumulative capital intended for investment in any portfolio company at one point in time 
instead  our investments consist of multiple rounds of financing of a given portfolio company  in which we typically participate if we believe that the merits of such an investment outweigh the risks 
we also commonly have preemptive rights to invest additional capital in our privately held portfolio companies 
these rights are useful to protect and potentially increase the value of our positions in our portfolio companies as they mature 
commonly  the terms of such financings in privately held companies also include penalties for those investors that do not invest in these subsequent rounds of financing 
without available capital at the time of investment  our ownership in the company would be subject to these penalties that can lead to a partial or complete loss of the capital invested prior to that round of financing 
we may have the opportunity to increase ownership in late rounds of financing in some of our most mature companies 
many private venture capital funds that invested in these companies are reaching the end of the term associated with their limited partnerships 
this issue may limit the available capital to these funds for follow on investments  and the ability to take advantage of potentially valuable terms given to those who have investable capital 
having permanent  liquid capital available for investment and access to the capital markets allows us to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise 
our sources of liquid capital the sources of liquidity that we use to make our investments are classified as primary and secondary liquidity 
as of december   and december   our total primary and secondary liquidity was  and  respectively 
we do not include funds available from our credit facility as primary or secondary liquidity 
we believe it is important to examine both our primary and secondary liquidity when assessing the strength of our balance sheet and our future investment capabilities 
primary liquidity is comprised of cash  us treasury securities and certain receivables 
as of december   we held  in us government obligations  and we had an additional  in cash  of which  was held in non interest bearing  fully fdic insured bank accounts 
as of december   we held  in cash  of which  was held in non interest bearing  fully fdic insured bank accounts 
the temporary unlimited fdic insurance coverage expired on january  as of december   we held in us government obligations 
with the expiration of the full fdic insurance on non interest bearing accounts on december   we expect to resume holding a portion of our cash in us government obligations 
on march   the company received payment of its portion of the proceeds held in escrow since the closing of the transaction on march   from amgen  inc s acquisition of biovex group  inc  totaling  on april   the company received  from the portion of our upfront payment held in escrow from the sale of crystal is  inc  to asahi kasei group 
these payments immediately added to our primary liquidity 
payments upon achieving milestones of the biovex group  inc  sale or expiration of the escrow periods for the crystal is  inc  and innovalight  inc  dispositions would also add to our primary liquidity in future quarters if these milestones are achieved successfully and escrowed funds are released in part or in full 
the probability adjusted values of the future milestone payments for the sale of biovex and of the funds held in escrow from the dispositions of crystal is and innovalight  as determined at the end of each fiscal quarter  are included as an asset on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and will be included in primary liquidity only if and when payment is received for achievement of the milestones and the funds held in escrow are released  respectively 
during the year ended december    shares of our investment in solazyme  inc  were called under option contracts 
we received  in gross proceeds from these transactions  which added to our primary liquidity 
we also sold an additional  shares of solazyme on the open market during this period for gross proceeds of  during the year ended december    shares of our investment in neophotonics corporation were called under option contracts 
we received  in gross proceeds from these transactions  which also added to our primary liquidity 
our secondary liquidity is comprised of the stock of publicly traded companies 
although these companies are publicly traded  their stock may not trade at high volumes and prices may be volatile  which may restrict our ability to sell our positions at any given time 
as of december   our secondary liquidity was  neophotonics corporation and solazyme  inc  account for  of this amount based on the closing price of each company as of december  as of december   shares of neophotonics and solazyme were trading below the strike price of the call options that were open and outstanding 
the fair value of our shares of champions oncology  inc  accounts for  of the total amount of secondary liquidity 
as of december   our secondary liquidity was  neophotonics and solazyme account for  of this amount based on the closing price of each company as of december  champions oncology accounts for  of the total amount of secondary liquidity 
as of december   and december   our shares of each of these companies were freely tradable securities 
a decision to sell our shares would result in the cash received from the sale of these assets being included in primary liquidity 
until that time  we will continue to include the value of our shares of our publicly traded portfolio companies in secondary liquidity unless the average trading volume of each company reaches sufficient levels for us to monetize our stock in such companies over a short period of time 
potential pending liquidity events from our portfolio as of december during the fourth quarter of  one of our portfolio companies received letters of intent to acquire the company 
as of december   discussions between this portfolio company and the potential acquirers are ongoing  and there can be no assurance that this company will be able to consummate a transaction within the next twelve months  if at all 
additionally  our companies often plan for and or begin the process of pursuing potential sales and or ipos of those companies by hiring bankers and or advisors to attempt to pursue such liquidity events 
we consider these efforts to be in the ordinary course of business for those companies until the potential and timing of a transaction become tangible through events such as receipt of letters of intent to acquire a company and or drafting of registration documents to pursue an ipo 
other than the company mentioned above  as of december   we did not have any additional companies for which the potential and timing of a transaction are tangible 
as of december   we valued potential milestone payments from the sale of biovex group  inc  at  if all the remaining milestone payments were to be paid by amgen  inc  we would receive  we have not received any milestone payments as of december   and there can be no assurance as to the timing and how much of this amount we will ultimately realize in the future  if any 
strategy for managing publicly traded positions our equity focused portfolio companies may seek to raise capital and provide liquidity to shareholders through ipos 
it is generally rare that pre ipo investors are afforded the ability to sell a portion of shares owned in the ipo 
these pre ipo shares are often subject to lock up provisions that prevent the sale of those shares  options against those shares or other transactions associated with those shares until expiration of the lock up period  which is often days from the date of the ipo 
we commonly plan to hold our shares of our publicly traded portfolio companies following the expiration of the lock up restrictions if we believe that the prospects for future growth of the portfolio company and the underlying value of our shares are as great or greater than other opportunities we are currently encountering 
we believe we are able to make such assessments using our extensive knowledge of the companies having actively worked with them and their management teams over multiple years as pre ipo investors 
as such  we may hold our shares of publicly traded portfolio companies for extended periods of time from the date of ipo 
following the expiration of the lock up restrictions  we may pursue the sale of call options covered by our ownership of shares in our publicly traded portfolio companies 
the company will only sell or write options on common stocks held in the company portfolio 
we will not sell naked call options  ie  options representing more shares of the stock than are held in the portfolio 
these call options give the buyer the right to purchase our stock at a given price  the strike price  prior to a specific date  the expiration date 
a call option whose strike price is above the current price of the underlying stock is called out of the money 
a call option whose strike price is below the current price of the underlying stock is called in the money 
when stocks in the portfolio rise  call options that were out of the money when written may become in the money  thereby increasing the likelihood that they could be exercised  and we would be forced to sell the stock 
the opposite would occur for an in the money option that would become out of the money if the stock were to fall below the strike price of the option 
we have used and currently plan to continue to use both in the money and out of the money options as part of our strategy for managing our ownership in publicly traded portfolio companies 
we may also purchase put options as a method of limiting the downside risk that the price per share of these companies may decrease substantially from current levels 
this type of option is particularly useful for hedging risk for volatile stocks such as neophotonics corporation and solazyme  inc  that are relatively illiquid compared to the number of shares owned by us 
a put option gives its holder the right to sell a specified number of shares of a specific security at a specific price known as the exercise strike price by a certain date 
the buyer of a put option is betting that the price of the security will decrease before the option expires 
the risk for us as the option holder is that the option expires unexercised  and we have lost the money spent on buying the option 
for conventional listed call options  the options expiration dates are commonly up to nine months from the date the call options are first listed for trading 
longer term call options can have expiration dates up to three years from the date of listing 
we currently expect the majority of written call options to be ones with expirations of equal to or shorter than one year from the date the call option is first listed for trading 
we believe this strategy of selling covered call options on our publicly traded portfolio companies provides at least three benefits we receive payment of a premium in cash at the time of the sale of the call option 
the amount of the premium received is negotiated between the buyer and us and is influenced generally by the market price of the underlying stock  the volatility of the stock and the length of time between the date of sale of the call option and the expiration date 
if the option expires out of the money  we retain the premium as a gain on our investment 
if the option is exercised  it enables the monetization of the stock held by us in an orderly transaction that yields known returns 
our publicly traded portfolio companies currently trade at small average daily volumes of shares compared with our positions in these companies 
as such  a decision by us to sell a portion or all of our shares in these companies in the public markets through brokers could negatively affect the price at which we would be able to sell these shares and  therefore  our ultimate returns 
the sale of a call option sets a price at which our shares would sell if the option is exercised  which negates the potential impact of illiquidity or other market dynamics on our returns from the sale of these shares 
that said  it also sets an upper limit for the proceeds we would receive in such sale 
we plan to enter into such contracts at a price per share and in a timeframe that we would be willing to sell those shares 
while we may repurchase call options when advantageous to us  we commonly do not sell call options with the expectation that we will repurchase them at a future date 
the sale of options may help generate interest and liquidity in the stock of our publicly traded portfolio companies 
current market dynamics make it difficult for small capitalization stocks to attract interest from institutional and retail investors 
this difficulty leads to low average trading volumes and low liquidity options for existing shareholders 
we believe the sale of call options may aid in increasing the interest and liquidity in the stock of these companies and may be beneficial to our future potential returns on these investments 
during the twelve months ended december   our strategy for managing our publicly traded positions has generated approximately  in net cash proceeds from premiums on call options sold and put options purchased of solazyme  inc we added approximately  in gross cash proceeds to our primary liquidity resulting from options called that were covered by a portion of our shares of solazyme 
during  we sold an additional  shares of solazyme for gross cash proceeds of  the net increase in our primary liquidity from these transactions was  the average sale price on assignments under option contracts and open market sales for solazyme was for the year 
our cost basis in solazyme is per share 
the proceeds from the premiums received from the sale of call options and the cash from the sale of shares discussed above have yielded cash that is approximately the same as the original amount we invested in solazyme 
this increase in primary liquidity is important for our efforts to continue to fund existing and new portfolio companies that could generate future investment returns 
as of december   we had  of our remaining  shares of solazyme under the following option contracts no 
of shares expiration date strike price  march  during the twelve months ended december   our strategy for managing our publicly traded positions has generated approximately  in net cash proceeds from premiums on call options sold and put options purchased of neophotonics corporation 
we also added approximately  in gross cash proceeds to our primary liquidity resulting from options called that were covered by a portion of our shares of neophotonics 
the net increase in our primary liquidity from these transactions was  the average sale price on assignments under option contracts of neophotonics was for the year 
our cost basis in neophotonics is per share 
as of december   we had  of our remaining  shares of neophotonics under the following option contracts no 
of shares expiration date strike price  february  current business environment the fourth quarter of ended with decreases in value in the public market indices 
these decreases coincided with a decrease in the number of ipos and m a transactions  though ipo values increased 
compared with  m a activity was comparable and the number of ipos decreased by percent 
these dynamics continue to lead to a difficult fundraising environment for venture capital firms and for venture backed companies  particularly those in the middle stages of development 
eight us venture backed companies raised billion through ipos in the fourth quarter of  which is a slight decline in number from the third quarter of companies and from the fourth quarter of companies  according to dow jones venturesource  thomson reuters and the national venture capital association nvca 
however  the capital raised increased from the third quarter of by million 
the capital raised in the fourth quarter of was approximately half of the capital raised in the same period of m a transactions of venture backed companies remained steady from the third to the fourth quarter  with deals in the fourth quarter 
there was a percent decrease in the number of transactions as compared with the fourth quarter of the number of m a transactions of venture backed companies decreased from in to in percent decline  according to thomson reuters and the nvca 
the average disclosed deal value for venture backed m a transactions disclosed of deals in the fourth quarter of was million  which is comparable with the fourth quarter of  but million less than the third quarter of the information technology sector dominated these deals  with of the deals 
life sciences companies had deals  with an average disclosed price disclosing of of million 
forty two us venture capital funds raised billion in the fourth quarter of  according to thomson reuters and the nvca 
compared with the third quarter of  this is a percent decrease in the number of funds down from fifty three and a percent decrease in the amount of capital raised down from billion 
the top five venture capital funds accounted for percent of the total fundraising in the fourth quarter  which is comparable with the third quarter 
venture capital fundraising for totaled billion  a percent increase in commitments as compared with billion 
this increase in monetary commitments comes despite a three percent decline in the number of funds with closings funds 
of the funds that raised capital  were new funds 
the current business environment is also complicated by global economic uncertainty and regional unrest 
it remains unclear if and how the debt crisis in europe will develop and whether it will result in a slowing of worldwide economic growth or even trigger a further global financial crisis 
it is unclear if the rising budget deficits and partisan politics in the united states will result in further downgrades in its credit rating 
any outcome could be heightened potentially should an alternative to us treasury securities emerge as the global safe haven for invested capital or should large holders of these securities  such as china  decide to divest of them in large quantities or in full 
further  many of our portfolio companies receive non dilutive funding through government contracts and grants 
sequestration could have a direct and significant reduction in our portfolio companies contract or grant awards 
sequestration will also likely result in reduced budgets at research facilities  which will reduce the volume of products they could potentially purchase from our portfolio companies 
all of this uncertainty could lead to a further broad reduction in risk taken by investors and corporations  which could reduce further the capital available to our portfolio companies  could affect the ability of our portfolio companies to build and grow their respective businesses  and could decrease the liquidity options available to our portfolio companies 
historically  difficult venture environments have resulted in a higher than normal number of companies not receiving financing and being subsequently closed down with a loss to venture investors  and other companies receiving financing but at significantly lower valuations than the preceding financing rounds 
this issue is compounded by the fact that many existing venture capital firms have few remaining years of investment and available capital owing to the finite lifetime of the funds managed by these firms 
additionally  even if a firm was able to raise a new fund  commonly venture capital firms are not permitted to invest new funds in existing investments 
this limitation of available capital can lead to fractured syndicates of investors 
a fractured syndicate can result in a portfolio company being unable to raise additional capital to fund operations  this issue is especially acute in capital intensive sectors that are enabled by science related innovations  such as life sciences  energy and electronics  which are generally not in favor among venture capital firms 
the result of these difficulties is that the portfolio company may be forced to sell before reaching its full potential or be shut down entirely if the remaining investors cannot financially support the company 
as such  improvements in the exit environment for venture backed companies through ipos and m a transactions may not translate to an increase in the available capital to venture backed companies  particularly those that have investments from funds that are in the latter stage of life unless the markets improve for some time into the future 
our overall goal remains unchanged 
we want to maintain our leadership position in investing in science enabled companies  particularly those enabled by nanotechnology and microsystems and to increase our net asset value 
the current environment for venture capital financings continues to favor those firms that have capital to invest regardless of the stage of the investee company 
we continue to finance our new and follow on equity and convertible debt investments from our cash reserves held in bank accounts 
we may in the future invest borrowed capital to take advantage of opportunities that we believe will return greater than the cost of such borrowed capital 
we have historically held  and may in the future again hold  our cash in us treasury securities 
we believe the current status of the venture capital industry and the current economic climate provide opportunities to invest this capital at historically low valuations and under favorable terms in equity and convertible and non convertible debt of new and existing privately held and publicly traded companies 
valuation of investments we value our privately held venture capital investments each quarter as determined in good faith by our valuation committee  a committee of all the independent directors  within guidelines established by our board of directors in accordance with the act 
see footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in consolidated financial statements 
the values of privately held  venture capital backed companies are inherently more difficult than publicly traded companies to assess at any single point in time because securities of these types of companies are not actively traded 
we believe  perhaps even more than in the past  that illiquidity  and the perception of illiquidity  can affect value 
management believes further that the long term effects of the difficult venture capital market and difficult exit environments will continue to affect negatively the fundraising ability of weak companies regardless of near term improvements in the overall global economy and public markets  and that these factors can also affect value 
in each of the years in the period through  the company recorded the following gross write ups in privately held securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year boy  gross write downs in privately held securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year  and change in value of private portfolio securities as a percentage of net assets at the beginning of the year

we note that our valuation committee and ultimately our board of directors take into account multiple sources of quantitative and qualitative inputs to determine the value of our privately held portfolio companies and our publicly traded portfolio companies whose values are not derived solely from the closing price on the last day of the quarter 
we also note that our valuation committee does not set the value of our freely tradable publicly traded portfolio companies  solazyme  inc  and neophotonics corporation 
even though our position in champions oncology  inc  is freely tradable as of december   subjective inputs are also included in the determination of value 
therefore  our valuation committee sets the value of this position 
we define non performance as the risk that the price per share or implied valuation of a portfolio company or the effective yield of a debt security of a portfolio company  as applicable  does not appropriately represent the risk that a portfolio company that requires or seeks to raise additional capital will be a unable to raise capital  will need to be shut down and will not return our invested capital  or b able to raise capital  but at a valuation significantly lower than the implied post money valuation 
our best estimates of non performance risk of our portfolio companies during the fourth quarter of are included in the valuation of the companies as of december  changes in non performance risk led to a net decrease in value of  in the future  as these companies receive terms for additional financings or if they are unable to receive additional financing and  therefore  proceed with sales or shutdowns of the business  we expect the contribution of the discount for non performance risk to vary in importance in determining the fair values of our securities of these companies 
changes in discounts for non performance risk could positively or negatively affect the value of our portfolio companies in future quarters 
as of december   non performance risk was a significant factor in determining the values of nine of our equity focused portfolio companies that are fair valued by our board of directors 
these nine companies accounted for approximately million  or percent  of the total value of our equity focused venture capital portfolio  not including our rights to milestone payments from the sale of biovex group  inc  to amgen  inc 
as of december   non performance risk was a significant factor in determining the values of of our equity focused portfolio companies that are fair valued by our board of directors 
these companies accounted for approximately million  or percent  of the total value of our equity focused venture capital portfolio  not including our rights to milestone payments from the sale of biovex group  inc  to amgen  inc 
we also note that our valuation of our securities of molecular imprints  inc  includes  that is ascribed to a non convertible bridge note 
the principal plus interest of this note was repaid in full in the third quarter of the remaining value results from a liquidation preference that survived the repayment of the note and  as currently written  would pay the company  should the company be sold for more than its outstanding debt and a contractual payment to management of molecular imprints 
this amount assumes that the total non convertible bridge note preferences of million are paid in full 
our value of this portion of our securities of molecular imprints as of december   reflects a probability weighted discount applied to the total amount of the preference 
as of december   our top ten investments by value accounted for approximately percent of the value of our equity focused venture capital portfolio

results of operations we present the financial results of our operations utilizing accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for investment companies 
on this basis  the principal measure of our financial performance during any period is the net increase decrease in our net assets resulting from our operating activities  which is the sum of the following three elements net operating income loss the difference between our income from interest  dividends  and fees and our operating expenses 
net realized gain loss on investments the difference between the net proceeds of sales of portfolio securities and their stated cost  plus income from interests in limited liability companies 
net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments the net unrealized change in the value of our investment portfolio 
owing to the structure and objectives of our business  we generally expect to experience net operating losses and seek to generate increases in our net assets from operations through the long term appreciation and monetization of our venture capital investments 
we have relied  and continue to rely  primarily on proceeds from sales of investments  rather than on investment income  to defray a significant portion of our operating expenses 
because such sales are unpredictable  we attempt to maintain adequate working capital to provide for fiscal periods when there are no such sales 
during and  we made two and three venture debt investments  respectively 
the potential for  or occurrence of  inflation could result in rising interest rates for government backed debt 
this trend would have two effects on our business 
first  the spread between the interest rates we can obtain from investing in low risk government debt versus high risk venture debt will compress  which would result in a reduction of the risk premium associated with investments in venture debt 
we may reduce the number and amount invested in venture debt should this risk premium decrease substantially as to not compensate us adequately for the risk associated with such investments 
second  funds drawn from our line of credit will accrue interest at a rate that fluctuates with either the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
libor and the prime rate are expected to increase in times of inflation 
our venture debt investments may include both fixed and floating interest rates 
our net interest income would decrease if the spread between the interest rate on funds from our line of credit and our venture debt investments decrease 
comparison of years ended december    and during the years ended december   and december   we had net decreases in net assets resulting from operations of  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of  investment income and expenses during the years ended december    and  we had net operating losses of   and  respectively 
the variation in these results is primarily owing to the changes in investment income and operating expenses  including non cash  stock based compensation expense of  in   in  and  in the increase in non cash  stock based compensation expense in is primarily associated with the compensation cost for restricted stock and the compensation cost for the voluntary cancellation of stock options during the second quarter of the employees who cancelled stock options realized no value from those options 
during the years ended december    and  total investment income was   and  respectively 
during the years ended december    and  total operating expenses were   and  respectively 
during  as compared with  investment income increased from  to  reflecting an increase in interest income from non convertible promissory notes  subordinated and senior secured debt  and senior secured debt through a participation agreement  offset by a decrease in interest income from convertible bridge notes and a decrease in our average holdings of us government securities 
during the twelve months ended december   we accrued net bridge note interest of  as compared with  during the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ended december   our average holdings of us government securities were  as compared with  during the twelve months ended december   primarily owing to the decrease in yield available over the durations of maturities in which we were willing to invest and the availability of fully fdic insured demand deposit bank accounts 
the average yield on our us government securities for the twelve months ended december   and  was percent and percent  respectively 
operating expenses  including non cash  stock based compensation expenses  were  and  for the twelve months ended december   and december   respectively 
the increase in operating expenses for the twelve months ended december   as compared with the twelve months ended december   was primarily owing to increases in salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense  administration and operations expense and rent expense  offset by decreases in professional fees  directors fees and expenses and custody fees 
salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expense increased by  or percent  through december   as compared with december   primarily as a result of an increase in non cash expense of  associated with the stock plan 
in may  the executive officers of the company voluntarily cancelled all of their outstanding stock options for no consideration 
this resulted in a one time charge of  to recognize all of the previously unrecognized compensation cost related to these options 
while the non cash  stock based compensation expense for the stock plan increased our operating expenses by  this increase was offset by a corresponding increase to our additional paid in capital  resulting in no net impact to our net asset value 
we also had increases in salaries of employees owing to cost of living adjustments and costs associated with the hiring of one full time employee and two part time employees  offset by a decrease in year end employee bonus expense of  and a decrease of  in the projected benefit obligation expense accrual for medical retirement benefits 
administration and operations expense increased by  or percent  through december   as compared with december   primarily as a result of increases in expenses associated with investor outreach expenses and costs of approximately  related to meet the portfolio day

we fund our day to day operations using interest earned and proceeds from our cash holdings  the sales of our investments in us government securities  when applicable  and interest earned from our venture debt securities 
we believe the increase or decrease in the value of our venture capital investments does not materially affect the day to day operations of the company or our daily liquidity

we have a million three year revolving credit facility with td bank  na this credit facility is used to fund our venture debt investments and not for the payment of day to day operating expenses 
as of december   we had no debt outstanding 
we have not issued any debt securities  and  therefore  are not subject to credit agency downgrades 
as a venture capital company  it is critical that we have capital available to support our best companies until we have an opportunity for liquidity in our investments 
as such  we will continue to maintain a substantial amount of liquid capital on our balance sheet 
however  to complement our equity focused portfolio investing  we seek to invest some of this capital in venture debt where we will have more defined investment return timelines than we currently have in our existing portfolio 
in addition  we may  from time to time  opt to borrow money to make investments in debt securities that generate cash flow and have a known timeframe for return on investment

we do not include funds held in escrow from the sale of investments in primary or secondary liquidity 
these funds will become primary liquidity if and when they are received at the expiration of the escrow period

we believe that the current and future venture capital environment may adversely affect the valuation of investment portfolios  lead to tighter lending standards and result in reduced access to capital 
these conditions may lead to a decline in net asset value and or decline in valuations of our portfolio companies in future quarters 
although we cannot predict future market conditions  we continue to believe that our current cash and us government security holdings and our ability to adjust our investment pace will provide us with adequate liquidity to execute our current business strategy

critical accounting policies the company significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and in the footnote to the consolidated schedule of investments 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company considers the following accounting policies and related estimates to be critical valuation of portfolio investments the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
as a bdc  we invest in primarily illiquid securities that generally have no established trading market 
investments are stated at value as defined in the act and in the applicable regulations of the sec and us gaap 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
asc provides a consistent definition of fair value that focuses on exit price in the principal  or most advantageous  market and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
asc also establishes the following three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs are in those markets for which there are few transactions  the prices are not current  little public information exists or instances where prices vary substantially over time or among brokered market makers  and level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
unobservable inputs are those inputs that reflect our own assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability based upon the best available information 
see note fair value of investments in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fair value measurements 
value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii the fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors for all other assets 
see valuation procedures in the footnote to consolidated schedule of investments 
as of december   our financial statements include venture capital investments valued at  the fair values of which were determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors 
as of december   approximately percent of our net assets represent investments in portfolio companies at fair value by the board of directors 
determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment  although our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining fair value of the portfolio investments 
factors that may be considered include  but are not limited to  the cost of the company s investment  transactions in the portfolio company s securities or unconditional firm offers by responsible parties  the financial condition and operating results of the company  the long term potential of the business and technology of the company  the values of similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses  multiples to revenues  net income or ebitda that similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses receive  the proportion of the company s securities we own and the nature of any rights to require the company to register restricted securities under the applicable securities laws  management assessment of non performance risk  the achievement of milestones  discounts for restrictions on transfers of publicly traded securities  and the rights and preferences of the class of securities we own as compared with other classes of securities the portfolio has issued 
in addition  with respect to our debt investments for which no readily available market quotations are available  we will generally consider the financial condition and current and expected future cash flows of the portfolio company  the creditworthiness of the portfolio company and its ability to meet its current debt obligations  the relative seniority of our debt investment within the portfolio company s capital structure  the availability and value of any available collateral  and changes in market interest rates and credit spreads for similar debt investments 
historically  difficult venture capital environments have resulted in companies not receiving financing and being subsequently closed down with a loss of investment to venture investors  and other companies receiving financing but at significantly lower valuations than the preceding rounds  leading to very deep dilution for those who do not participate in the new rounds of investment 
our best estimate of this non performance risk has been quantified and included in the valuation of our portfolio companies as of december  all investments recorded at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value 
hierarchical levels related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets  are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
as of december   approximately percent of our portfolio company investments were classified as level in the hierarchy  indicating a high level of judgment required in their valuation 
the values assigned to our assets are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized  as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated or become readily marketable 
upon sale of investments  the values that are ultimately realized may be materially different from what is presently estimated 
stock based compensation determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant requires judgment 
historically  we have used the black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
management uses the black scholes merton option pricing model in instances where we lack historical data necessary for more complex models and when the share award terms can be valued within the model 
other models may yield fair values that are significantly different from those calculated by the black scholes merton option pricing model 
management uses a binomial lattice option pricing model in instances where it is necessary to include a broader array of assumptions 
we used the binomial lattice model for the year nqsos granted on march   and for performance based restricted stock awards 
these awards included accelerated vesting provisions or target stock prices that were based on market conditions 
option pricing models require the use of subjective input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
variations in the expected volatility or expected term assumptions have a significant impact on fair value 
as the volatility or expected term assumptions increase  the fair value of the stock option increases 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
a higher assumed dividend rate yields a lower fair value  whereas higher assumed interest rates yield higher fair values for stock options 
in the black scholes merton model  we use the simplified calculation of expected term as described in the sec s staff accounting bulletin because of the lack of historical information about option exercise patterns 
in the binomial lattice model  we use an expected term that assumes the options will be exercised at two times the strike price because of the lack of option exercise patterns 
future exercise behavior could be materially different than that which is assumed by the model 
expected volatility is based on the historical fluctuations in the company stock 
the company stock has historically been volatile  which increases the fair value of the underlying share based awards 
gaap requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited owing to employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after the grant date is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate proves to be higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which would result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate proves to be lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which would result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
such adjustments would affect our operating expenses and additional paid in capital  but would have no effect on our net asset value 
pension and post retirement benefit plan assumptions the company provides a retiree medical benefit plan for employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
until it was terminated on may   the company also provided an executive mandatory retirement benefit plan for certain individuals employed by us in a bona fide executive or high policy making position 
our former president accrued benefits under this plan prior to his retirement  and the termination of the plan has no impact on his accrued benefits 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability values related to our post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about the discount rate  the rate of increase in healthcare costs  and mortality  among others 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the post retirement medical benefit and pension liabilities could be effectively settled considering the timing of expected payments for plan participants 
in estimating this rate  we consider the citigroup pension liability index in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions 
the weighted average rate we utilized to measure our post retirement medical benefit obligation as of december   and to calculate our expense was percent 
we used a discount rate of percent to calculate our pension obligation for the executive mandatory retirement benefit plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of market risk to be valuation risk  interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
although we are risk seeking rather than risk averse in our investments  we consider the management of risk to be essential to our business 
valuation risk value  as defined in section a of the act  is i the market price for those securities for which market quotations are readily available and ii fair value as determined in good faith by  or under the direction of  the board of directors for all other assets 
see the valuation procedures in the footnote to consolidated schedule of investments contained in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 
because there is typically no public market for our interests in the privately held small businesses in which we invest  the valuation of the equity interests in that portion of our portfolio is determined in good faith by our board of directors with the assistance of our valuation committee  comprised of the independent members of our board of directors  in accordance with our valuation procedures 
in the absence of a readily ascertainable market value  the determined value of our portfolio of equity interests may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the equity interests existed 
determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment  although our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining fair value of the portfolio investments 
factors that may be considered include  but are not limited to  readily available public market quotations  the cost of the company s investment  transactions in the portfolio company s securities or unconditional firm offers by responsible parties  the financial condition and operating results of the company  the long term potential of the business and technology of the company  the values of similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses  multiples to revenues  net income or ebitda that similar securities issued by companies in similar businesses receive  the proportion of the company s securities we own and the nature of any rights to require the company to register restricted securities under the applicable securities laws  management assessment of non performance risk  the achievement of milestones  and the rights and preferences of the class of securities we own as compared with other classes of securities the portfolio has issued 
in addition  with respect to our debt investments for which no readily available market quotations are available  we will generally consider the financial condition and current and expected future cash flows of the portfolio company  the creditworthiness of the portfolio company and its ability to meet its current debt obligations  the relative seniority of our debt investment within the portfolio company s capital structure  the availability and value of any available collateral  and changes in market interest rates and credit spreads for similar debt investments 
any changes in valuation are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as net increase decrease in unrealized appreciation on investments 
changes in valuation of any of our investments in privately held companies from one period to another may be volatile 
investments in privately held  immature companies are inherently more volatile than investments in more mature businesses 
such immature businesses are inherently fragile and easily affected by both internal and external forces 
our investee companies can lose much or all of their value suddenly in response to an internal or external adverse event 
conversely  these immature businesses can gain suddenly in value in response to an internal or external positive development 
the values assigned to our assets are based on available information and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized  as these amounts depend on future circumstances and cannot be reasonably determined until the individual investments are actually liquidated or become readily marketable 
upon sale of investments  the values that are ultimately realized may be materially different from what is presently estimated 
interest rate risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates 
because we have historically funded a portion of our venture debt investments with borrowings  our net investment income will be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow 
our borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our option  based on either a libor plus percent or the higher of the federal funds rate plus basis points or the us prime rate 
the interest rates are fixed for the interest period selected 
however  these interest periods renew approximately every three months 
therefore  variations in interest rates affect the rates at which we can borrow and may increase our interest expense during any given period 
additionally  in the future  we may fund a portion of our equity investments with borrowings 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income in future quarters 
at december   we had no debt outstanding 
we may also invest in both short and long term us government and agency securities 
to the extent that we invest in short and long term us government and agency securities  changes in interest rates result in changes in the value of these obligations that result in an increase or decrease of our net asset value 
the level of interest rate risk exposure at any given point in time depends on the market environment  the expectations of future price and market movements  and the quantity and duration of long term us government and agency securities held by the company  and it will vary from period to period 
if the average interest rate on us government securities at december   were to increase by  and basis points  the average value of these securities held by us at december   would decrease by approximately   and  respectively  and the portion of our net asset value attributable to such securities would decrease correspondingly 
in addition  market interest rates for high yield corporate debt are an input in determining value of our investments in debt securities of privately held and publicly traded companies 
significant changes in these market rates could affect the value of our debt securities as of the date of measurement of value 
our investment income could be adversely affected should such debt securities include floating interest rates 
we do not currently have any investments in debt securities with floating interest rates 
foreign currency risk most of our investments are denominated in us dollars 
we currently have one investment denominated in canadian dollars 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to potential changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the potential loss in fair value on this investment resulting from a percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is  at december
