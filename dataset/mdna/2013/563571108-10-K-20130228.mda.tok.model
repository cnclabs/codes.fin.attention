market conditions and outlook in  we are planning for continued growth in both of our two business segments cranes and related products and foodservice equipment 
we are focused on margin improvement in the face of slow growth and potentially choppy end markets and macro economies 
lingering concerns over government transitions  regulatory policies  and consumer confidence have influenced our outlook and action plans as we start however  our team has proven time and again its ability to navigate through challenging landscapes 
we have been diligent in our efforts to improve operational efficiencies and manage our cost structure over the last several years 
looking ahead to  we expect foodservice segment revenues to improve modestly in the mid single digit range and operating margins to be consistent in  versus we expect crane segment revenues to increase in the high single digit range in versus additionally  we anticipate that operating margins in our crane segment will be in the high single digit range 
other financial expectations include capital expenditures of approximately million  depreciation and amortization of approximately million  a debt reduction target to exceed million  between million and million reduction in interest expense  and full year effective tax rate in the mid percent range

as a result  our year end backlog has stabilized at million as of december  compared to million in december  our initiatives in the area of quality  reliability and performance are producing positive results 
these include improving customer satisfaction index csi scores  reduced warranty claims  improved mean time between failure mtbf and improved emissions 
our investments in a component and systems validation and accelerated life cycle testing facility has improved our new product development process and the reliability of our cranes 
we believe these efforts  combined with the cost reduction initiatives and the process and facilities improvements that have been made in and prior years  allow us to deliver better cranes to our customers in a more efficient manner 
we expect the opportunities and the need for cranes to continue all around the globe 
we enjoy filling the needs from many industries including construction  infrastructure  refining  all forms of energy production and energy transmission 
we also continue to see demand for our industry leading product support services 
our crane care business is not only a key differentiator for us  but it is also especially important to our customers as the market rebounds to ensure uptime availability 
forecasting remains challenging due to mixed views from trade association and industry economists as well as continued sovereign financial issues in europe 
we continue to use what we believe to be the best information that is available and have also expanded our efforts to become more responsive to changes in demand between regions and product lines 
these efforts allow us to better meet the sudden changes in demand that an unstable recovering economy makes and this allows us to

quick service restaurant qsr  snack beverage  managed services and hospitals are projected to be the fastest growing major segments 
mafsi forecast for sales is a healthy gain in equipment and supplies 
this reflects the largely north american perspective of mafsi which escapes the difficulties of the softer global economy  especially in europe 
according to mafsi the hot spots of activity are education k and colleges  health care  and chain accounts while the soft spots are fine dining  independent operators  and correctional institutions 
globally  euromonitor projects that foodservice operator sales growth will continue at approximately  global outlet growth will continue at approximately  with the qsr and full service segments experiencing faster outlet growth based on continued rapid expansion in asia pacific  latin america and the middle east 
growth in the asia pacific region will be driven by a cultural preference for social  sit down dining and upwardly mobile consumers seeking quick  value priced options 
euromonitor also reports that in latin america  consumers are demanding more premium dining options in a full service environment  while major fast food players are increasing their focus on the region and expanding aggressively 
euromonitor expects there will be significant opportunities in key gulf states  albeit from a relatively small base 
our strong position gives us significant opportunities to grow along with our customers

our debt position at various times increases our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions  and results in a meaningful portion of our cash flow from operations being used for payment of interest on our debt 
this could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions or take advantage of future business opportunities 
our ability to service our debt is dependent upon many factors  some of which are not subject to our control  such as general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  and regulatory factors 
in addition  our ability to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility in the future will depend on our meeting the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement  even after taking into account such new borrowings 
the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility  or other future facilities  may be used for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  funding future acquisitions  and other operating  investing and financing needs 
we believe

the company has not provided for additional us income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of consolidated non us subsidiaries included in stockholders equity 
such earnings could become taxable upon sale or liquidation of these non us subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation of cash balances 
at december   approximately million of our total cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries 
this cash is associated with earnings that we have asserted are permanently reinvested 
we have no current plans to repatriate cash or cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such cash and cash equivalents to support our operations and continued growth plans outside the united states through funding of capital expenditures  acquisitions  research  operating expenses or other similar cash needs of these operations 
further  we do not currently forecast a need for these funds in the united states because the us operations and debt service is supported by the cash generated by the us operations 
the company intent is to repatriate foreign cash when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits or when earnings qualify as previously taxed income 
management also considers the following regarding liquidity and capital resources to identify trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that require disclosure a 
our senior credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial ratios and tests to comply with the terms of the agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december   the latest measurement date 
the occurrence of any default of these covenants could result in acceleration of any outstanding balances under the senior credit facility 
further  such acceleration would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing our notes  notes  and notes  and could trigger cross default provisions in other agreements 
b 
circumstances that could impair our ability to continue to engage in transactions that have been integral to historical operations or are financially or operationally essential  or that could render that activity commercially impracticable  such as the inability to maintain a specified credit rating  level of earnings  earnings per share  financial ratios  or collateral 
we do not believe that these risk factors applicable to our business are reasonably likely to impair our ability to continue to engage in our planned activities at this time 
c 
factors specific to us and our markets that we expect to be given significant weight in the determination of our credit rating or will otherwise affect our ability to raise short term and long term financing 
we do not presently believe that events covered by these risk factors applicable to our business could materially affect our credit ratings or could adversely affect our ability to raise short term or long term financing

we also had buyback commitments and residual value guarantees with a balance outstanding of million as of december  this amount is not reduced for amounts the company would recover from the repossession and subsequent resale of collateral 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states  europe and asia 
the company has established the retirement plan committee to manage the operations and administration of all benefit plans and related trusts 
as of december   all of the remaining united states defined benefit plans were merged into a single plan the manitowoc us pension plan 
all merged plans had benefit accruals frozen prior to merger of plan 
in  cash contributions by us to all pension plans were million  and we estimate that our pension plan contributions will be approximately million in financial risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodities  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use derivative financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have written policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of corporate finance and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes or speculation is strictly prohibited 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies and the financial instruments that we use  please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to fluctuating interest rates for our debt 
we have established programs to mitigate exposure to these fluctuations 
the company is a party to various interest rate swaps or caps in connection with the senior credit facility and the 
table of contents senior notes 
on may   the company entered into the senior credit facility which includes a million term loan a  million term loan b and million revolver 
subsequently  the company entered interest rate cap agreements during the third quarter with a beginning notional value of million and reducing notional value over time based on our projections for pay down of term loan debt 
these interest rate derivative instruments effectively cap the company s future interest rate exposure for million of the original notional value of its variable term debt at a one month us libor rate of plus the applicable spread per the senior credit facility 
as of december   the notional value of these interest rate cap agreements was million 
as of december   the company did not have any float to fixed interest rate hedges outstanding on term loans a and b 
as of december   total notional swapped from fixed to floating rate debt was million for the notes 
the variable rate of interest on these fixed to float interest rate swaps was at december  a increase or decrease in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt would result in an immaterial change in interest expense for the year ended december  commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for commodities  including steel  copper  aluminum  and petroleum based products 
each of our business segments is subject to the effect of changing raw material costs caused by movements in underlying commodity prices 
we have established programs to manage the negotiations of commodity prices 
some of these programs are centralized across business segments  and others are specific to a business segment or business unit 
in addition to the regular negotiations of material prices with certain vendors  we routinely enter into certain commodity hedges that fix the price of certain of our key commodities utilized in the production of our foodservice and crane product offerings 
commodities that are hedged include copper  aluminum  certain steel inputs and natural gas 
at december   million net of tax of million of unrealized losses due to commodity hedging positions remain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be realized as a component of cost of sales over the next months 
currency risk we have manufacturing  sales and distribution facilities around the world and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies 
international sales  including those sales that originated outside of the united states  were approximately of our total sales for  with the largest percentage being sales into various european countries 
regarding transactional foreign exchange risk  we enter into limited forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency rates between a budgeted rate and the rate realized at the time we recognize a particular purchase or sale transaction and reduce the earnings and cash flow impact on nonfunctional currency denominated receivables and payables 
gains and losses resulting from hedging instruments either impact our consolidated statements of operations in the period of the underlying purchase or sale transaction  or offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables being hedged 
the maturities of these forward exchange contracts coincide with either the underlying transaction date or the settlement date of the related cash inflow or outflow 
the hedges of anticipated transactions are designated as cash flow hedges under the guidance of accounting standards codification asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
at december   we had outstanding forward exchange contracts hedging anticipated transactions and future settlements of outstanding accounts receivable and accounts payable with an after tax market value of a million net of tax of million asset 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december  for fair value hedges would not have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of operations as any gains or losses under the foreign exchange contracts hedging accounts receivable or payable balances would be offset by equal gains or losses on the underlying receivables or payables 
a appreciation or depreciation of the underlying functional currency at december  for cash flow hedges would not have a significant impact on the date of settlement due to the insignificant amounts of such hedges 
amounts invested in non us based subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at year end 
results of operations are translated into us dollars at an average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as cumulative translation adjustments 
the translation adjustment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income at december  was million 
environmental  health  safety  and other matters please refer to part ii  item  note  contingencies and significant estimates  where we have disclosed our environmental  health  safety  contingencies and other matters 

table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all its subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements giving due consideration to materiality 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
although we have listed a number of accounting policies below which we believe to be most critical  we also believe that all of our accounting policies are important to the reader 
therefore  please refer also to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the company 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized and earned when all the following criteria are satisfied with regard to a specific transaction persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  collectability of cash is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we periodically enter into transactions with customers that provide for residual value guarantees and buyback commitments 
these transactions are recorded as operating leases for all significant residual value guarantees and for all buyback commitments 
these initial transactions are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized to income on a straight line basis over a period equal to that of the customer third party financing agreement 
in addition  we lease cranes to customers under operating lease terms 
revenue from operating leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease  and leased cranes are depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts based on pre established percentages to specific aging categories which are subject to change if experience improves or deteriorates 
inventories and related reserve for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using both the first in  first out fifo method and the last in  first out lifo method and are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated reserve is based upon specific identification of excess or obsolete inventories based on pre established percentages applied to specific aging categories of inventory 
these categories are evaluated based upon historical usage  estimated future usage  and sales requiring the inventory 
these percentages were established based upon historical write off experience and are subject to change if experience improves or deteriorates 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
under asc topic  goodwill is not amortized  however  the company performs an annual impairment review at june of every year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units  which have been determined to be cranes americas  cranes europe  middle east  and africa  cranes china  cranes greater asia pacific  crane care  foodservice americas  foodservice europe  middle east  and africa  and foodservice asia  using a fair value method  primarily the income approach  based on the present value of future cash flows  which involves management judgments and assumptions about the amounts of those cash flows and the discount rates used 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including recorded goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets are then subject to risk of write down to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
the company has not experienced any further impairment charges since march see note  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company will continue to monitor market conditions and determine if any additional interim reviews of goodwill  other intangibles or long lived assets are warranted 
deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with the company projections may ultimately result in a future impairment 
in the event the company determines that assets are impaired in the future  the company would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge  which could have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated balance sheet and results of operations 
the company also reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the company conducts its long lived asset impairment analyses in accordance 
table of contents with asc topic  property  plant  and equipment 
asc topic requires the company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and to evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows 
other intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
indefinite and definite lived intangible assets are also subject to impairment testing 
indefinite lived assets are tested annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
definite lived intangible assets are tested whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of the assets 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 
employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement health care coverage 
plan assets and obligations are recorded annually based on the company measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  compensation increases  retirement and mortality rates  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the approach we use to determine the annual assumptions are as follows discount rate our discount rate assumptions are based on the interest rate of noncallable high quality corporate bonds  with appropriate consideration of our pension plans participants demographics and benefit payment terms 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets assumptions are based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds  which is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
compensation increase our compensation increase assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation retirement and mortality rates our retirement and mortality rate assumptions are based primarily on actual plan experience and mortality tables 
health care cost trend rates our health care cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends measurements of net periodic benefit cost are based on the assumptions used for the previous year end measurements of assets and obligations 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
we have developed the assumptions with the assistance of our independent actuaries and other relevant sources  and we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
refer to note  employee benefit plans  for a summary of the impact of a change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets and a change on health care trend rates would have on our financial statements 
product liability we are subject in the normal course of business to product liability lawsuits 
to the extent permitted under applicable laws  our exposure to losses from these lawsuits is mitigated by insurance with self insurance retention limits 
we record product liability reserves for our self insured portion of any pending or threatened product liability actions 
our reserve is based upon two estimates 
first  we track the population of all outstanding pending and threatened product liability cases to determine an appropriate case reserve for each based upon our best judgment and the advice of legal counsel 
these estimates are continually evaluated and adjusted based upon changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding the case 
second  we determine the amount of additional reserve required to cover incurred but not reported product liability issues and to account for possible adverse development of the established case reserves collectively referred to as ibnr 
this analysis is performed at least twice annually 
we have established a position within the actuarially determined range  which we believe is the best estimate of the ibnr liability 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the guidance of asc topic  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we record a valuation allowance that represents a reserve on deferred tax assets for which utilization is not more likely than not 
management judgment is required in 
table of contents determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our policy is to remit earnings from foreign subsidiaries only when it would be tax effective through the utilization of foreign tax credits or when earnings qualify as previously taxed income 
accordingly  we do not currently provide for additional united states and foreign income taxes which would become payable upon repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
we measure and record income tax contingency accruals under the guidance of asc topic we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management 
these reevaluations are based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  successfully settled issues under audit  expirations due to statutes  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual 
stock compensation the computation of the expense associated with stock based compensation requires the use of certain valuation models and based on projected achievement of underlying performance criteria for performance shares 
we currently use a black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our stock options and monte carlo analysis to calculate the total shareholder return portion of performance shares 
the black scholes and monte carlo models require assumptions regarding the volatility of the company stock  the expected life of the stock award and the company dividend ratio 
we primarily use historical data to determine the assumptions to be used in the black scholes model and have no reason to believe that future data is likely to differ materially from historical data 
however  changes in the assumptions to reflect future stock price volatility  future dividend payments and future stock award exercise experience could result in a change in the assumptions used to value awards in the future and may result in a material change to the fair value calculation of stock based awards 
warranties in the normal course of business  we provide our customers warranties covering workmanship  and in some cases materials  on products manufactured by us 
such warranties generally provide that products will be free from defects for periods ranging from months to months with certain equipment having longer term warranties 
if a product fails to comply with our warranty  we may be obligated  at our expense  to correct any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product 
we provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under our warranty at the time product revenue is recognized based on historical warranty experience for the related product or estimates of projected losses due to specific warranty issues on new products 
these costs primarily include labor and materials  as necessary  associated with repair or replacement 
the primary factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates or warranty claims 
as these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations  we assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the amounts as necessary 
restructuring charges restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities are recognized when the liability is incurred 
the company accounts for restructuring charges under the guidance of asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations 
the liability for the restructuring charge associated with an exit or disposal activity is measured initially at its fair value

 presentation of comprehensive income  which eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity 
the company can elect to present the items of net income and other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
under either method the statement would need to be presented with equal prominence as the other primary financial statements 
the amended guidance  which must be applied retroactively  is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and has been incorporated into these financial statements 
cautionary statements about forward looking information statements in this report and in other company communications that are not historical facts are forward looking statements  which are based upon our current expectations  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what appears within this quarterly report 
forward looking statements include descriptions of plans and objectives for future operations  and the assumptions behind those plans 
the words anticipates  believes  intends  estimates  targets and expects  or similar expressions  usually identify forward looking statements 
any and all projections of future performance are forward looking statements 
in addition to the assumptions  uncertainties  and other information referred to specifically in the forward looking statements  a number of factors relating to each business segment could cause actual results to be significantly different from what is presented in this quarterly report
