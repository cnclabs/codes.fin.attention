most of our loans are secured by real estate located in florida 
our profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned and paid on these balances 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the

index to financial statements interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows  and loan demand 
additionally  our profitability is affected by such factors as the level of non interest income and expenses  the provision for credit losses  and the effective tax rate 
non interest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and related services  and also includes commissions earned on bond sales  brokering single family home loans  trust services  sale of mutual funds  annuities and other non traditional and non insured investments 
non interest expense consists of compensation  employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  and other operating expenses

lucie volusia duval correspondent banking division we also operate a correspondent banking and bond sales division 
the division is integrated with and part of our subsidiary bank  csb  located in winter haven  florida  although the majority of our bond salesmen  traders and operations personnel are physically housed in leased facilities located in birmingham  alabama and atlanta  georgia 
the business lines of this division are primarily divided into three inter related revenue generating activities 
the first  and largest  revenue generator is commissions earned on fixed income security sales 
the second category includes a correspondent bank deposits ie  federal funds purchased and b correspondent bank checking accounts 
the third  revenue generating category  includes fees from safe keeping activities  bond accounting services for correspondents  asset liability consulting related activities  and correspondent clearing account services 
the customer base includes small to medium size financial institutions primarily located in florida  alabama  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  virginia and west virginia 
fdic assisted acquisitions and other branching activities in january of we acquired two failed financial institutions through fdic assisted transactions 
these acquisitions included a trust department  approximately million of deposits and loans with a fair value as of the acquisition date of approximately million 
substantially all the loans have loss share agreements beginning with the first dollar of loss 
in total  these two acquisitions included branch locations  all within our current geographical market footprint  or in the jacksonville area  where we had recently hired a management team with the intention of expanding our footprint into northeastern florida 
we have consolidated and closed branches  merged our remaining subsidiary bank into our lead bank  csb  and reduced our work force by ftes from its peak 
we currently operate our branch banking offices  all within florida and our correspondent banking business with total ftes full time equivalents of as of december  critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments

index to financial statements allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry concentrations  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
we use a standardized loan grading system which is integral to our risk assessment function related to lending 
loan officers assign a loan grade to their newly originated loans in accordance with the standard loan grades 
throughout the lending relationship  the loan officer is responsible for periodic reviews  and if warranted he she will downgrade or upgrade a particular loan based on specific events and or analyses 
we use a loan grading system of through grade is excellent and grade is doubtful 
loans graded or higher are placed on a watch list each month end and reported to the bank s board of directors 
our loan review officers  who are independent of the lending function and are not employees of our subsidiary bank  periodically reviews loan portfolios and lending relationships 
the review officer may disagree with the bank s grade on a particular loan and subsequently downgrade or upgrade such loan s based on his risk analysis 
although our credit review process has always been centralized  prior to our lending process was decentralized through multiple banking subsidiaries 
between early and june  all of the banking subsidiaries were consolidated into our lead bank  forming a single banking subsidiary resulting in a centralized and consistent lending process 
beginning early in  our chief credit officer cco  our chief special asset disposition manager cspa and their teams are responsible for identifying and reporting all impaired loans  non accrual loans  tdrs and oreo 
they hold monthly meetings with our ceo  our subsidiary bank ceo  and a senior level accounting officer who along with the cco and cspa is ultimately responsible for preparing the company s allowance for loan loss calculations each quarter 
the company s cfo and others also attend these meetings periodically 
the cco  cspa and their teams make sure that all non performing loans  subject to asc  as well as oreo properties have a current appraisal less than one year old and that the asset is written down to of the current appraisal  or less under certain circumstances  such as a listing price in the case of oreo  or a time value adjustment in the case of loans with appraisals approaching their one year life  and the related collateral is either in a type of category or in a market area with declining values 
when these monthly meetings start  these teams have already evaluated their positions and have identified the course of action on each of the troubled assets listed 
the purpose of the meetings is to allow the sharing of information and allow our ceo and the ceo of our lead subsidiary bank to review these evaluations with our cco and cspa  and either approve or modify their recommendations 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance consists of three components 
the first component consists of amounts specifically reserved specific allowance for specific loans identified as impaired  as defined by fasb accounting standards codification no 
asc 
impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed upon 
each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan  if any 
that is to say  a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principal and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 
the second component is a general reserve general allowance on all of the company s loans other than those identified as impaired 
we group these loans into categories with similar characteristics and then apply a loss factor to each group which is derived from our historical loss factor for that category adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors  as well as for certain loan grading factors 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the third component consists of amounts reserved for purchased credit impaired loans 
on a quarterly basis  the company updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected  incorporating assumptions regarding default rates  loss severities  the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions 
probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows trigger the recognition of impairment  which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related foregone interest cash flows discounted at the pool s effective interest rate 
impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses 
probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses  any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income 
the impacts of i prepayments  ii changes in variable interest rates  and iii any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income 
disposals of loans  which may include sales of loans  receipt of payments in full by the borrower  or foreclosure  result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit impaired portfolio 
the aggregate of these three components results in our total allowance for loan losses 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill resulting from business combinations after january   is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any non controlling interests in the acquiree  over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but tested for impairment at least annually 
we have selected november as the date to perform the annual impairment test 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet 
we have a million goodwill asset on our consolidated balance sheet at december  other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible and trust intangible assets arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions 
they are initially measured at fair value and then amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives  generally years 
goodwill and intangible assets are described further in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we determine our income tax expense based on management s judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes 
these permanent differences result in an effective tax rate  which differs from the federal statutory rate 
in addition  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities  recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition  based on management s judgment and estimates regarding timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes 
we must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is not more likely than not 
in making this assessment  management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and the possible application of future tax planning strategies 
management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition will be fully realized  although there is no guarantee that those assets will be recognizable in future periods 
we have a net deferred tax liability of million in our consolidated balance sheet at december  for additional discussion of income taxes  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

index to financial statements purchased credit impaired loans we account for acquisitions under the purchase accounting method 
all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value 
we review each loan or loan pool acquired to determine whether there is evidence of a deterioration in credit quality since inception and if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual loan agreements 
we consider expected prepayments and estimated cash flows including principal and interest payments at the date of acquisition 
the amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows is not accreted into earnings 
the amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows over the book value of the loan is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan accretable yield 
the company records these loans on the acquisition date at their net realizable value 
thus  an allowance for estimated future losses is not established on the acquisition date 
we refine our estimates of the fair value of loans acquired for up to one year from the date of acquisition 
subsequent to the date of acquisition  we update the expected future cash flows on loans acquired on a quarterly basis 
losses or a reduction in cash flow which arise subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as a charge through the provision for loan losses 
an increase in the expected cash flows adjusts the level of the accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan 
fdic loss share receivable we have entered into agreements with the fdic for reimbursement of losses within acquired loan portfolios 
the fdic loss share receivable is recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition based upon the expected reimbursements to be received from the fdic adjusted by a discount rate which reflects counter party credit risk and other uncertainties 
changes in the underlying credit quality of the loans covered by the fdic loss share receivable result in either an increase or a decrease in the fdic loss share receivable 
deterioration in loan credit quality increases the fdic loss share receivable  increases in credit quality decrease the fdic loss share receivable 
proceeds received for reimbursement of incurred losses reduce the fdic loss share receivable

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses expense decreased  to  during the year ending december  compared to  for the comparable period in our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings  and is decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries on prior loan charge offs 
therefore  the provision for loan losses income statement effect is a residual of management s determination of allowance for loan losses balance sheet approach 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider those levels maintained by conditions of individual borrowers  the historical loan loss experience  the general economic environment  the overall portfolio composition  and other information 
as these factors change  the level of loan loss provision changes 
also  the loan loss provision in was elevated due to the sale of credit impaired loans in the wholesale market during because of the large bargain purchase gains recognized pursuant to the acquisition of federal trust bank and the acquisition of branches and loans from td bank during  management determined that the company had sufficient capital to allow for the loss related to the sale of these troubled loans in the wholesale market  and elected to purge the loans at discounts versus management time and energy working them through the foreclosure process and eventually selling the repossessed assets in future years 
in addition  the put back period related to our federal trust bank loans expired during the fourth quarter of  at which time additional allowance for loan losses were added to the general allowance pursuant to this segment of performing loans  also effecting our loan loss provision

was its best year to date for bond sales 
we expect significant future volatility in the fixed income business  and therefore do not consider their initial four year performance necessarily a trend 
when future expected cash flows of the fdic covered loans increase  this increase is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the related loan pools 
the fdic indemnification asset ia represents the receivable from the fdic for reimbursement of of the expected losses in the covered pools 
when management increases its expected loan cash flows  it decreases the expected reimbursement  or ia  by of this amount 
the decrease in expected reimbursements is amortized negative accretion over the remaining life of the related loss share term  and is included in the company s non interest income as a negative amount 
at december   the company s cumulative estimate of excess loan cash flows over the initial estimates is approximately  this additional amount is being accreted into interest income over the life of the related loan pools 
approximately of this estimated additional cash flow  or  is being amortized negative accretion in non interest income over a nine year period the end of the last loss share term agreement  of which more than half will be amortized in less than three years 
the net effect is that  as of december   the company has estimated that it will improve its pre tax income  over time  by approximately   estimated additional cash flows from covered loans minus  expected reduction in reimbursements from the fdic

as shown in the table above  this expense increased approximately  or year to year 
the reasons for this increase include the following in january  we acquired two failed financial institutions which included branches in the aggregate 
the company consolidated three branches in the first quarter of and another six branches in the second quarter of we incurred the related incremental expenses in for these branches until they closed 
in addition  the two failed banks operated on two different core processing systems  which we were not converted to our core processing system until may and june of  adding elevated cost in terms of data processing  personnel and other temporary inefficiencies above the normalized incremental operating expenses 
in november  we acquired five branches from the hartford insurance group  inc the additional operating costs of these five branches were included in our expenses for two months versus all twelve months in in addition to closing of the branches we acquired in  we also closed an additional branch in february and four more branches at the end of august in addition to consolidating and closing branches  and a reduction in workforce  we also initiated other cost efficiencies and revenue enhancements during the year 
our quarterly operating expenses decreased by approximately in the fourth quarter compared to our high water mark in the second quarter of income tax provision we recognized an income tax expense for the year ended december  of  an effective tax rate of compared to  an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the reason our effective tax rate was lower than our statutory tax rate in and is because we had tax exempt income in excess of non deductible expenses thereby decreasing our taxable income below our book pre tax income as recorded in our consolidated statement of operations

troubled loans with unpaid legal balances and carrying balances of approximately  and  respectively  were sold for  during the third quarter of the portion of the provision for loan losses that represented the liquidation discount from this sale was approximately  prior to this sale  the loans had been written down to fair value and the provision for loan losses increased accordingly 
during the fourth quarter of  troubled loans with unpaid legal balances and carrying balances of approximately  and  respectively  were sold for  the company recorded approximately  of additional provision for loan losses representing the liquidation discounts as a result of this loan sale 
our policy is to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings  and is decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries on prior charge offs 
therefore  the provision for loan losses income statement effect is a residual of management s determination of allowance for loan losses balance sheet approach 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider those levels maintained by conditions of individual borrowers  the historical loan loss experience  the general economic environment  the overall portfolio composition  and other information 
as these factors change  the level of loan loss provision changes

index to financial statements non interest income non interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the comparable period in this increase was the result of the following components listed in the table below increase decrease increase decrease service charges on deposit accounts income from correspondent banking and bond sales division correspondent banking division other fees commissions from sale of mutual funds and annuities debit card and atm fees loan related fees boli income trading securities revenue fdic indemnification asset amortization accretion of discount rate fdic indemnification income   n a other service charges and fees gain on sale of securities subtotal bargain purchase gain from acquisitions total non interest income as shown in the table above  the primary reasons for the increase in non interest income year to year was the bargain purchase gain from the january purchase from td bank  na and the november purchase from hartford 
in both cases  selected performing loans were purchased at a discount with regard to td bank  na transaction and a discount with regard to the hartford transaction  which was the primary reason for the bargain purchase gains 
the correspondent banking bond sales volume and related income can experience a high degree of volatility from year to year based on various factors 
the division had an outstanding year in most of which can be attributed to a record third quarter 
the fdic indemnification asset ia discount amortization is producing negative amortization due to adjustments in the fdic covered loan portfolio 
that is  to the extent current adjusted projected losses in the covered loan portfolio are less than originally projected losses  and therefore future loan accretion yields increase  the related projected reimbursements from the fdic contemplated in the ia is less  which produces a negative income accretion in non interest income 
this event corresponds to the increase in yields in the fdic covered loan portfolio 
when a fdic covered oreo property is sold at a loss  the loss is included in non interest expense as loss on sale of oreo  and eighty percent of the loss is recorded as fdic indemnification income and included in non interest income 
eighty percent of any related loan pool impairments also are reflected in this account 
we sell securities available for sale from time to time pursuant to our asset liability management process

we incurred the related incremental expenses for approximately five months during versus the entire year for each of these three banks operated on three different core processing systems  which we were not able to convert to our core processing system until june  july and august of  adding elevated cost in terms of data processing  personnel and other temporary inefficiencies above the normalized incremental operating expenses

index to financial statements comparison of balance sheets at december  and december  overview our total assets grew by  or  from  at december  to  at december  the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of two failed financial institutions pursuant to fdic assisted transactions during january we acquired total assets of  and total deposits of  at fair value on the acquisition dates 
we strategically decreased both acquired and legacy deposits  in particular time deposits  by repricing them downward to market interest rates when the opportunities presented themselves 
on the other side of the balance sheet we primarily reduced securities available for sale to fund those liability reductions 
deflating our balance sheet in this manner allowed us to free up addition capital for other potential expansion opportunities 
in addition  this contributed to our decrease in cost of deposits and cost of total interest bearing liabilities and improved our interest earning asset mix 
our loan to deposit ratio increased from at december  to at december  investment securities available for sale we account for our securities at fair value and classify them as available for sale  except for trading securities 
unrealized holding gains and losses are included as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of the effect of deferred income taxes 
if our management intends to sell or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment otti will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if our management does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the assessment of whether an otti decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 
our available for sale portfolio totaled  at december  and  at december   or and  respectively  of total assets 
see the tables below for a summary of security type  maturity and average yield distributions 
we use our security portfolio primarily as a tool to manage our balance sheet  manage our regulatory capital ratios  as a source of liquidity and a base from which to pledge assets for repurchase agreements and public deposits 
when our liquidity position exceeds expected loan demand  other investments are considered as a secondary earnings alternative 
typically  we remain short term in our decision to invest in certain securities 
as these investments mature  they will be used to meet cash needs or will be reinvested to maintain a desired liquidity position 
we have designated all of our securities as available for sale  except our trading portfolio  to provide flexibility  in case an immediate need for liquidity arises 
we believe the composition of the portfolio offers flexibility in managing our liquidity position and interest rate sensitivity  without adversely impacting our regulatory capital levels 
the available for sale portfolio is carried at fair market value and had a net unrealized gain of approximately  at december   compared to a net unrealized gain of approximately  at december  we invest primarily in direct obligations of the united states  obligations guaranteed as to the principal and interest by the united states  mortgage backed securities  municipal securities and obligations of government sponsored entities and agencies of the united states

the loan portfolio is the largest component of earning assets  and it therefore generates the largest portion of revenues 
the absolute volume of loans and the volume of loans as a percentage of earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin as loans are expected to produce higher yields than securities and other earning assets

we will reimburse the fdic for its share of recoveries with respect to the covered loans 
the loss sharing agreements applicable to single family residential mortgage loans provide for fdic loss sharing and our reimbursement to the fdic for recoveries for ten years 
the loss sharing agreements applicable to commercial loans provides for fdic loss sharing for five years and our reimbursement to the fdic for a total of eight years for recoveries 
of the of our loans  or  not covered by fdic loss sharing agreements  approximately are collateralized by real estate  are commercial non real estate loans and the remaining are consumer and other non real estate loans 
the loans collateralized by real estate are further delineated as follows 
residential real estate loans these are single family home loans originated within our local market areas by employee loan officers or purchased from td bank  na and the hartford insurance group with two and one year put back options that expired on january  and november   respectively 
we do not use loan brokers to originate loans for our own portfolio  nor do we acquire loans outside of our geographical markets 
the size of this portfolio is  representing approximately of our total loans  excluding those covered by fdic loss share agreements 
within this category there are approximately  non performing non accrual loans loans as of december  commercial real estate loans this is the largest category  of our loan portfolio representing approximately of our total loans  excluding those covered by fdic loss share agreements 
this category  along with commercial non real estate lending  is our primary business 
there is no significant concentration by type of property in this category but there is a geographical concentration such that the properties are all located within florida  primarily central florida 
the borrowers are a mix of professionals  doctors  lawyers  and other small business people 
approximately of these loans are owner occupied 
within this category there are approximately  non performing non accrual loans loans as of december  land  development and construction loans we have no construction or development loans with national builders 
we do business with local builders and developers that have typically been long time customers 
this category represents approximately  of our total loan portfolio 
the majority of this amount is land development  lots  and other land loans 
approximately  of loans in this category are non performing non accrual loans loans as of december   of which substantially all are collateralized by residential building lots  commercial building lots  undeveloped land and vacant land both residential and commercial 
loan concentrations are considered to exist where there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities  which collectively could be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and when the total of such amounts would exceed of total capital

see liquidity and market risk management for a discussion regarding the repricing structure of the loan portfolio 
credit quality and allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a charge to current period earnings and decreased by loan charge offs net of recoveries of prior period loan charge offs 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the allowance consists of three components 
the first component consists of amounts reserved for impaired loans  as defined by asc impaired loans are those loans that management has estimated will not repay as agreed pursuant to the loan contract 
each of these loans is required to have a written analysis supporting the amount of specific reserve allocated to the particular loan  if any 
that is to say  a loan may be impaired ie not expected to repay as agreed  but may be sufficiently collateralized such that we expect to recover all principle and interest eventually  and therefore no specific reserve is warranted 
the second component is a general reserve on all of our loans other than those identified as impaired and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
the historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced over the most recent two years 
this actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment 
the following portfolio segments have been identified residential real estate commercial real estate construction and land development commercial and industrial not collateralized by real estate consumer not collateralized by real estate loans acquired through the federal trust bank ftb acquisition the historical loss factors for each portfolio segment is adjusted for current internal and external environmental factors  as well as for certain loan grading factors 
the environmental factors that we consider are listed below 
we consider changes in the levels of and trends in past due loans  non accrual loans and impaired loans  and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans 
also  we consider changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 
we consider levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries 
we consider changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans 
we consider changes in lending policies  procedures and practices  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses 
we also consider changes in the quality of our loan review system 
we consider changes in the experience  ability  and depth of our lending management and other relevant staff 
we consider changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio  including the condition of various market segments national and local economic trends and conditions 
we consider the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in our existing portfolio industry conditions 
we consider the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations 
the third component consists of amounts reserved for purchased credit impaired loans 
on a quarterly basis  the company updates the amount of loan principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected  incorporating assumptions regarding default rates  loss severities  the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current market conditions 
probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows

impairments that occur after the acquisition date are recognized through the provision for loan losses 
probable and significant increases in expected principal cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses  any remaining increases are recognized prospectively as interest income 
the impacts of i prepayments  ii changes in variable interest rates  and iii any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income 
disposals of loans  which may include sales of loans  receipt of payments in full by the borrower  or foreclosure  result in removal of the loan from the purchased credit impaired portfolio

non performing assets consist of non performing loans plus a oreo ie real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  b other repossessed assets that are not real estate  and c are not covered by fdic loss share agreements 
we place loans on non accrual status when they are past due days and management believes the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
when we place a loan on non accrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected interest is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent collections reduce the principal balance of the loan until the loan is returned to accrual status or interest is recognized only to extent received in cash 
the largest component of non performing loans is non accrual loans  which as of december  totaled  loans  excluding loans covered by fdic loss share agreements

management considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that we will not be repaid as agreed pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
once the loan has been identified as impaired  a written analysis is performed to determine if there is a potential for a loss 
if it is probable that a loss may occur  a specific allowance  or a partial charge down  for that particular loan is then recognized 
the loan is then placed on non accrual status and included in non performing loans 
if the analysis indicates that a loss is not probable  then no specific allowance  or partial charge down  is recognized 
if the loan is still accruing  it is not included in non performing loans 
loans that are monitored for impairment pursuant to asc generally include commercial  commercial real estate  land  acquisition development of land  and construction loans greater than  smaller homogeneous loans  such as single family first and second mortgages  consumer loans  and small business and commercial related loans are not generally subject to impairment monitoring pursuant to asc  but are analyzed for potential losses based on historical loss factors  current environmental factors and to some extent loan grading

in this current real estate environment it has become more common to restructure or modify the terms of certain loans under certain conditions 
in certain circumstances it may be more beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties  versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in an unfavorable real estate market

loans are modified to minimize loan losses when we believe the modification will improve the borrower s financial condition and ability to repay the loan 
we typically do not forgive principal 
we generally either reduce interest rates or decrease monthly payments for a temporary period of time and those reductions of cash flows are capitalized into the loan balance 
we may also extend maturities  convert balloon loans to longer term amortizing loans  or vice versa  or change interest rates between variable and fixed rate 
each borrower and situation is unique and we try to accommodate the borrower and minimize the company s potential losses 
approximately of our tdrs are current pursuant to their modified terms  and about  or approximately of our total tdrs are not performing pursuant to their modified terms 
there does not appear to be any significant difference in success rates with one type of concession versus another 
we are continually analyzing our loan portfolio in an effort to recognize and resolve our problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
while we believe we use the best information available at the time to make a determination with respect to the allowance for loan losses  we recognize that many factors can adversely impact various segments of our markets  and subsequent adjustments in the allowance may be necessary if future economic indications or other factors differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determination or if regulatory policies change 
we continuously focus our attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential problem loans  as they arise

these arrangements are not transactions with investment bankers or brokerage firms  but rather  with several of our larger commercial customers who periodically have excess cash balances and do not want to keep those balances in non interest bearing checking accounts 
because our bank is not permitted to pay interest on commercial checking accounts  we offer an arrangement through a repurchase agreement whereby balances are transferred from a checking account into a repurchase agreement arrangement on which we will pay a daily adjustable interest rate of the federal fund rate minus an amount that traditionally ranged between and  but currently is a much smaller due to the low interest rate environment during the daily average balance of these short term borrowing agreements for the years ended december   and  was approximately   and  respectively

liquidity and market risk management market and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity 
this confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves 
liquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis 
we measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily and weekly basis 
liquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate based liabilities  as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs 
liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations cost effectively and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments  lease obligations  and unexpected deposit outflows 
in this process  we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the rate sensitive position  or gap  is the difference in the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities  at a given time interval  including both floating rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the measurement of our interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques we use in our asset liability management effort 
our bank generally attempts to maintain a range set by policy between rate sensitive assets and liabilities by repricing periods 
the range set by the bank has been approved by its board of directors 
if our bank falls outside their pre approved range  it requires board action and board approval  by the bank s board of directors 
the asset mix of our balance sheet is evaluated continually in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  and appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the balance sheet focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
our gap and liquidity positions are reviewed periodically to determine whether or not changes in policies and procedures are necessary to achieve financial goals

index to financial statements as stated earlier  the rate sensitivity table above summarizes our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing periods at a point in time 
it does not include assumptions about sensitivity to changes in various interest rates by asset or liability type  correlation between macro environment market rates and specific product types  lag periods  cash flows or other assumptions and projections 
however  in addition to static gap analysis  our bank also uses simulation models to estimate the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
simulation is a better technique than gap analysis because variables are changed for the various rate conditions 
each category s interest change is calculated as rates ramp up and down 
in addition  the repayment speeds and repricing speeds are changed 
rate shock is a method for stress testing the net interest margin over the next four quarters under several rate change levels 
these levels span in bps increments up and down from the current interest rates 
in order to simulate activity  maturing balances are replaced with the new balances at the new rate level  and repricing balances are adjusted to the new rate shock level 
the interest is recalculated for each level along with the new average yield 
net interest margin is then calculated and a margin risk profile is developed 
the results of these calculations  as of december  looking four quarters into the future  for our combined bank  is summarized in the table below 
change in interest rates bps bps bps bps bps bps bps resulting effect on net interest income a current a the percentage change in each of these boxes represents a percentage change from the net interest income dollars that the models projected for the next four quarters 
to put this in perspective  as an example  our net interest income for was  assuming a bps decrease in rates  our model is suggesting that our net interest income would decrease by  or approximately  likewise  assuming a bps increase in rates  our model is suggesting that our net interest income would increase by  or approximately  it is important to reiterate again  that these models are built on a multitude of assumptions and predictions 
this is not an exact science 
the benefit that we see is measuring our overall interest rate risk profile 
although we are by no means suggesting the exactness of the numbers above  what we see as a take away is that in general  it appears that if market interest rates increase  it would suggest a benefit to our net interest income 
if market interest rates decrease  it would suggest a negative effect on our net interest income 
we believe that our interest rate risk is manageable and under control as of december  simulation and rate shock stress testing our net interest income nim is a forward looking analysis 
that is  it estimates  based on various assumptions  what the effect on our nim might be given various changes in future interest rates 
another way of analyzing our interest rate risk profile is looking at history 
the table below measures the correlation between our nim and market interest rates over a year period starting at the beginning of and ending on december  we used the prime lending rate as a surrogate for market interest rates 
this simple correlation is not perfect because we ignore changes in duration of our asset liability portfolio over time and changes in the slope of the yield curve over time  as well as other significant environmental changes that may occur  such as the recent banking crisis 
however  it will demonstrate that over time our asset liability portfolio generally tended to be asset sensitive 
that is  in general  over this historical period  when market interest rates increased  our nim increased  and when market interest rates decreased  our nim decreased 
in the following table  the prime rate is measured by the vertical bars  and their scale is on the left hand side of the graph 
each bar represents a month 
our nim is represented by the line graph and its scale is on the right hand side of the graph 
the line graph is connecting a series of dots  which represents our nim for a given quarter

the bank regulatory agencies have established risk based capital requirements for banks 
these guidelines are intended to provide an additional measure of a bank s capital adequacy by assigning weighted levels of risk to asset categories 
banks are also required to systematically maintain capital against such off balance sheet activities as loans sold with recourse  loan commitments  guarantees and standby letters of credit 
these guidelines are intended to strengthen the quality of capital by increasing the emphasis on common equity and restricting the amount of loan loss reserves and other forms of equity such as preferred stock that may be included in capital 
our subsidiary banks objective is to maintain its current status as a well capitalized institution as that term is defined by its regulators 
under the terms of the guidelines  banks must meet minimum capital adequacy based upon both total assets and risk adjusted assets 
all banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of  a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to average assets of leverage ratio 
adherence to these guidelines has not had an adverse impact on our company 
in addition  our bank has placed a self imposed voluntary target that it will maintain a tier leverage ratio tier capital divided by average assets of at least  and has communicated that to the occ  its primary regulatory agency 
the occ has not placed any restrictions or targets upon the company s subsidiary bank

unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
in addition  inflation affects financial institutions increased cost of goods and services purchased  the cost of salaries and benefits  occupancy expense  and similar items 
inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity  earnings  and shareholders equity 
commercial and other loan originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase  and can reduce our earnings from such activities 
off balance sheet arrangements we generally do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  other than approved and unfunded loans and letters and lines of credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business

our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
our asset liability committee alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position  and establishing policies to monitor and limit the exposure to interest rate risk 
substantially all of our interest rate risk exposure relates to the financial instrument activity of our subsidiary bank 
as such  the board of directors of our subsidiary bank is responsible to review and approve the policies and guidelines established by their bank s alco 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin  after tax return on assets and return on equity capital  as well as adequate liquidity and capital 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored through gap analysis and simulation analysis  which measures the amount of repricing risk associated with the balance sheet at specific points in time
