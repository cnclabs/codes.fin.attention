item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
factors that could cause or contribute to differences from estimates include those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors contained in item above 
overview westmoreland coal company is an energy company employing approximately  employees whose operations include six surface coal mines in montana  wyoming  north dakota and texas  and two coal fired power generating units in north carolina 
we sold million tons of coal in our two principal operating segments are our coal segment and our power segment  in addition to two non operating segments 
one of the major factors affecting the volume of coal that we sell in any given year is the domestic demand for coal generated electric power  as well as the specific demand for coal by our customers 
numerous factors affect the domestic demand for electric power and the specific demands of customers including weather patterns  the presence of hydro or wind in our particular energy grids  environmental and legal challenges  political influences  energy policies  international and domestic economic conditions  power plant outages and other factors discussed herein 
we sell almost all of our coal and electricity production under long term agreements 
our long term coal contracts typically contain price escalation and adjustment provisions  pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised in line with cost inflation 
the contract may adjust the price in accordance with changes in broad economic indicators such as the consumer price index  commodity specific indices such as the ppi light fuel oils index  and or changes in our actual costs 
we refer to these contracts as cost plus contracts 
for our contracts that are not cost plus in nature  we have exposure to inflation and price risk for supplies used in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel and explosives 
in line with the worldwide mining industry  we have experienced increased operating costs for mining equipment  diesel fuel and other supplies  such as tires 
we manage these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers and may use derivatives from time to time 
kemmerer mine acquisition and add on notes on december   we entered into an agreement with chevron mining inc to acquire the kemmerer surface coal mine located in kemmerer  wyoming 
we closed this acquisition on january  this transaction included approximately million tons of total proven or probable coal reserves as of december  the kemmerer mine has an estimated life at current production levels of approximately years 
the total consideration paid by us to acquire the kemmerer mine included million in cash and our assumption of approximately million in liabilities  including retiree medical benefits for current union employees  the underfunded portion of the pension and reclamation obligations 
in january  we completed the private placement of million of senior secured notes due in add on notes  which notes were additional notes issued pursuant to the existing parent notes indenture the parent notes  collectively referred to as the senior notes 
the net proceeds from the add on notes financed the million cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of the kemmerer mine and the million cash bonding obligations for the kemmerer mine 
the net proceeds also covered the cash transaction costs associated with the kemmerer acquisition and the add on notes offering of approximately million 
the remaining net proceeds were partially used to fund the initial operating expenses associated with the kemmerer mine 
the use of proceeds from the offering of add on notes to finance the acquisition of the kemmerer mine is shown in the table below in millions proceeds received from the add on notes cash consideration for the kemmerer acquisition reclamation bonding collateral transaction fees and expenses initial purchaser discount remaining proceeds beulah mine coal supply contract our coal supply contract with coyote station  located adjacent to our beulah mine  expires in may 
table of contents on may   coyote station informed us they are entering into a mine development agreement with another provider and on october   coyote station entered into a coal supply agreement with that provider 
as a result  coyote station will likely not purchase coal from our beulah mine after the expiration of our current contract 
based on the uncertainty of securing a new contract  we revised various accounting estimates beginning in the fourth quarter of to reflect the impact on mining operations of the current contract expiration in for the past several years  the beulah mine has averaged million tons of coal sold per year to coyote station 
we are currently considering strategic alternatives for our beulah mine  which also provides approximately million tons of coal to the heskett station power plant on an annual basis 
we will continue to evaluate the effect of this development and potential strategic alternatives on various employment related liabilities  which could result in revised accounting estimates related to those liabilities in future periods 
xcel fire in november  an explosion and subsequent fire occurred at unit of xcel energy sherburne county generating station  or unit  which is the largest customer of our absaloka mine 
xcel indicated that unit will be offline for an extended period while xcel investigates the source of the explosion and the extent of the damage 
while sherburne county generating station initially indicated a start up date of march  they have informed us that the delay will be longer 
westmoreland resources  inc  or wri  our wholly owned subsidiary that operates the absaloka mine  maintains business interruption insurance coverage and submitted a notice of loss to its insurance carriers 
our insurance carriers have accepted liability under the policy for the business interruption claim 
we recognize income as business interruption losses are incurred and reimbursement is virtually assured and have recognized million of income and received million of cash proceeds for the year ended december  insurance proceeds are included in net cash provided by operating activities 
results of operations items that affect comparability of our results for and each of the prior two years  our results have included items that do not relate directly to ongoing operations 
the income expense components of these items were as follows year ended december  in thousands loss on extinguishment of debt fair value adjustment on derivative and related amortization of debt discount impact pre tax items recorded in we recorded million of loss on extinguishment of debt related to repurchases of senior notes with a principal amount of million 
the loss on the repurchases was measured based on the carrying value of the repurchased portion of the senior notes  which included a portion of the unamortized debt issue costs and the debt discount on the dates of repurchase 
items recorded in we recorded million of loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of the parent notes offering 
the loss included a million make whole payment for rova s debt and million of non cash write offs of unamortized discount on debt and related capitalized debt costs and convertible debt conversion expense 
upon the parent notes offering and subsequent retirement of our convertible debt  we recorded an expense of million resulting from the mark to market accounting for the conversion feature in the notes with million of interest expense of a related debt discount 
items recorded in we recorded expense of million resulting from the mark to market accounting of the conversion feature in our convertible notes  primarily due to an increase in our stock price during  with million of interest expense of a related debt discount

reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss the discussion in results of operations in  and includes references to our adjusted ebitda results 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are key metrics used by us to assess our operating performance and we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because these measures are used widely by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors  and help investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda is a measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
the items excluded from ebitda and adjusted ebitda are significant in assessing our operating results 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
for example  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments  do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements necessary to pay income taxes  do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  and do not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on certain of our debt obligations 
in addition  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
other companies in our industry and in other industries may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently from the way that we do  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 
because of these limitations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda and adjusted ebitda only as supplemental data 
the tables below show how we calculated adjusted ebitda  including a breakdown by segment  and reconciles adjusted ebitda to net less  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure

our parent holding company has significant cash requirements to fund our debt obligations  ongoing heritage health benefit costs  pension contributions  and corporate overhead expenses 
the principal sources of cash flow to the parent company are distributions from our principal operating subsidiaries 
the cash at rova  kemmerer  and wri has no restrictions and is immediately available 
the cash at wml is available to us through quarterly distributions 
the wml credit agreement requires a debt service account and imposes timing and other restrictions on the ability of wml to distribute funds to us 
the cash at wrmi is also available to us through dividends and is subject to maintaining a statutory minimum level of capital  which is two hundred and fifty thousand dollars 
under the indenture governing the senior notes  we are required to offer a portion of our excess cash flow as defined by the indenture for each fiscal year to purchase some of these notes at of the principal amount

table of contents the loan agreement contains various affirmative  negative and financial covenants 
financial covenants in the agreement include a fixed charge coverage ratio and an ebitda measure 
the fixed charge coverage ratio must meet or exceed a specified minimum 
the ebitda covenant requires a minimum amount of ebitda to be achieved

see note to our consolidated financial statements for details 
represents benefit payments for our postretirement medical benefits  black lung  workers compensation  and combined benefit fund plans  as well as contributions for our defined benefit pension plans and final reclamation costs 
critical accounting policies postretirement medical benefits we have an obligation to provide postretirement medical benefits to our former employees and their dependents 
detailed information related to this liability is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our liability for our employees postretirement medical benefit costs is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in amounts equal to the actuarially determined liability  as this obligation is not funded 
we use various assumptions including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the cost and obligation for this item 
our discount rate for postretirement medical benefit is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model  which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liability 
this model is calculated using a yield curve that is developed using the average yield for bonds in the tenth to ninetieth percentiles  which excludes bonds with outlier yields 
our discount rates at december  ranged from to compared to at december  in  our postretirement medical benefit liability increased million primarily due to the kemmerer acquisition and from decreases in discount rates 
we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care obligations 
our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data and projecting forward the participant claims and our current benefit coverage 
these projections include the continuation of cost savings we achieved in from the modernization of how we provide prescription drug benefits to retirees 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations 
the ppaca could potentially impact these benefits 
the ppaca has both short term and long term implications on 
table of contents healthcare benefit plan standards 
implementation of this legislation is planned to occur in phases  with plan standard changes taking effect beginning in  but to a greater extend with the benefit plan year and extending through we will continue to evaluate the impact of the ppaca in future periods as additional information  interpretations and guidance becomes available 
below we have provided a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the significance of the health care cost trend rate assumptions in relation to reported amounts 
postretirement medical benefits health care cost trend rate increase decrease in thousands effect on service and interest cost components effect on postretirement medical benefit obligation asset retirement obligations  final reclamation costs and reserve estimates our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of cost estimates for final reclamation of surface land and support facilities at both surface mines and power plants in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws 
asset retirement obligations are based on projected pit configurations at the end of mining and are determined for each mine using estimates and assumptions including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage  the timing of these cash flows  and a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
as changes in estimates occur such as mine plan revisions  changes in estimated costs  or changes in timing of the final reclamation activities  the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free rate to the changes 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different from currently estimated 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform final reclamation and mine closing activities 
certain of our customers have either agreed to reimburse us for final reclamation expenditures as they are incurred or have pre funded a portion of the expected reclamation costs 
see additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes and deferred income taxes as of december   we had significant deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets include federal and state regular net operating losses nols  alternative minimum tax amt  credit carryforwards  indian coal tax credits ictc carryforwards  and net deductible reversing temporary differences related to on going differences between book and taxable income 
we believe we will be taxed under the amt system for the foreseeable future due to the significant amount of statutory tax depletion in excess of book depletion expected to be generated by our mining operations 
as a result  we have determined that a valuation allowance is required for all of our regular federal net operating loss carryforwards and amt credit carryforwards since they are only available to offset future regular taxes 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance for all of our state nols since we believe they will not be realized 
we have determined that a full valuation allowance is required for all of our ictc carryforward 
the ictc can generally be used to offset amt liability 
we do not believe we have sufficient positive evidence to substantiate that our deferred tax asset for the ictc carryforward is realizable at a more likely than not level of assurance 
as a result  we will continue to record a full valuation allowance on our ictc carryforward 
we have determined that since our net deductible temporary differences will not reverse for the foreseeable future  and we are unable to forecast when we will have regular taxable income when they do reverse  a full valuation allowance is required for these deferred tax assets 
the tax effect of pretax income or loss from continuing operations is generally determined by a computation that does not consider the tax effects of items that are not included in continuing operations 
the exception to that incremental approach is that all items for example  items recorded in other comprehensive income  extraordinary items  and discontinued operations be considered in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that shall be allocated to continuing operations 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements the accounting standards adopted in did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include financial instruments with off balance sheet risk such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
we utilize surety bonds and letters of credit issued by financial institutions to third parties to assure the performance of our obligations relating to reclamation  workers compensation obligations  postretirement medical benefit obligations  and other obligations 
these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
we use a combination of surety bonds and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation  workers compensation  postretirement medical benefit and other obligations as follows as of december  reclamation obligations workers compensation obligations post retirement medical benefit obligations other total in thousands surety bonds letters of credit item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk we manage our price risk for coal sales  electricity and steam production through the use of long term agreements  rather than through the use of derivatives 
nearly all of our coal and our electricity production are sold under long term agreements 
these coal contracts typically contain price escalation and adjustment provisions  pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised 
the price may be adjusted in accordance with changes in broad economic indicators such as the consumer price index  commodity specific indices such as the ppi light fuel oils index  and or changes in our actual costs 
for our contracts which are not cost plus  we have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel and explosives 
we manage these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers and may use derivatives from time to time 
at december   we had fuel supply contracts outstanding with a minimum purchase requirement of million gallons of diesel fuel per year 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception under hedge accounting 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates due to our existing indebtedness that is indexed to either prime rate or libor 
however  based on the balances outstanding as of december   our exposure to interest rate risk is not material as of such date 
in the future  if we were to draw on our wml or corporate revolving line of credit  or if we enter into a new credit facility indexed to a variable interest rate  such as the prime rate or libor  then we would be exposed to market risk associated with interest rates 
we have not historically used interest rate hedging instruments to manage our interest rate risk
