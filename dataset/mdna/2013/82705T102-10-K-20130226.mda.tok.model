table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  delivery or performance has occurred  pricing is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
product revenue sell in product revenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment to customers not eligible for price concessions and rights of return including shipments to direct customers and certain shipments to distributors 
revenue from products sold to distributors with agreements allowing for stock rotations  but not price protection  is generally recognized upon shipment 
reserves for stock rotations are estimated based primarily on historical experience and provided for at the time of shipment  and are not significant 
sell through product revenue is recognized only when the distributor reports that it has sold the product to its end customer 
this method of product revenue recognition is used for products sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and stock rotation or product return rights  as the sales price is not fixed or determinable at the time of shipment to the distributor 
our recognition of such distributor sell through is based on point of sales reports received from the distributor which establish a customer  quantity and final price 
price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to its customer 
once we receive the point of sales reports from the distributor  our sales price for the products sold to end customers is fixed  as any product returns  stock rotation and price concession rights for that product lapse upon the sale to the end customer 
from time to time  at our distributors request  we enter into conversion agreements to convert certain products  which are designated for a specific end customer  from sell through to sell in products 
the effect of these conversions is to eliminate any price protection or return rights on such products 
revenue for such conversions is recorded at the time such conversion agreements are signed  as it is at that point that the distributor ceases to have any price protection or return rights for such products 
at the time of shipment to distributors for which revenue is recognized on a sell through basis  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment  we relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and  until revenue is recognized  we record the gross margin in deferred margin on sale to distributors  a component of current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods will be less than the originally recorded deferred margin on sales to distributor as a result of negotiated price concessions 
we sell each item in our product price book to all of our sell through distributors worldwide at a relatively uniform list price 
however  distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points based on customer  product  quantity  geography  competitive pricing and other factors 
the majority of our distributors resales are priced at a discount from the list price 
often  under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed 
thus  a portion of the deferred margin on the sale to distributor balance represents a portion of distributors original purchase price that will be remitted back to the distributor in the future 
the wide 
table of contents range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to the distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred margin on the sale to distributors that will be remitted back to the distributors 
in addition to the above  we also reduce the deferred margin by anticipated or determinable future price protections based on revised price lists  if any 
licensing revenue we enter into ip licensing agreements that generally provide licensees the right to incorporate our ip components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee and revenue earned under such agreements is classified as licensing revenue 
our ip licensing agreements generally include multiple elements  which may include one or more off the shelf and or customized ip licenses bundled with support services covering a fixed period of time  usually one year 
during  we followed the guidance in financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standards codification asc no 
 multiple element arrangements revenue recognition  to determine whether there was more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables were separable into multiple units of accounting  we allocated the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using the residual method  if objective and reliable evidence of fair value did not exist for delivered elements 
we then recognized revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria 
beginning in the year ended december   for such multiple element ip licensing arrangements  we follow the guidance in fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition asc topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
for multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable 
esps reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
for the elements of ip licensing agreements we concluded that vsoe exists only for our support services based on periodic stand alone renewals 
for all other elements in ip licensing agreements  we concluded that no vsoe or tpe exists because these elements are almost never sold on a stand alone basis by us or our competitors 
our process for determining esp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
the key factors considered by us in developing the esps include prices charged by us for similar offerings  if any  our historical pricing practices  the nature and complexity of different technologies being licensed 
amounts allocated to the delivered off the shelf ip licenses are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
amounts allocated to the support services are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the support period  usually one year 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history of receiving royalties to enable us to make a reliable estimate of the amount of royalties owed to us 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use 
table of contents of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped per the royalty reports ultimately received from the customer 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty reports are received 
we also perform compliance audits for our licenses and any additional royalties as a result of the compliance audits are recorded as revenue in the period when the compliance audits are settled and the customers agrees to pay the amounts due 
for contracts related to licenses of our technology that involve significant modification  customization or engineering services  we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc no 
 construction type and production type contracts revenue recognition 
revenues derived from such license contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we determine progress to completion based on input measures using labor hours incurred by our engineers 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total contract fees and the percentage of completion achieved 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
the estimates for labor hours have not been significantly different as compared to actual labor hours 
if there is significant uncertainty about customer acceptance  or the time to complete the development or the deliverables by either party  we apply the completed contract method 
the contract is considered substantially complete upon customer acceptance 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenues are recorded as deferred revenue 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc no 
 stock compensation initial measurement  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options  restricted stock units rsus  performance share awards and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp based on estimated fair values 
following the provisions of asc no 
 employee share purchase plans recognition  our espp is considered a compensatory plan  therefore  we are required to recognize compensation cost for grants made under the espp 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and a single option award approach 
the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility  expected option life  and risk free interest rate 
management estimates volatility for a given option grant by evaluating the historical volatility of the period immediately preceding the option grant date that is at least equal in length to the option s expected term 
consideration is also given to unusual events either historical or projected or other factors that might suggest that historical volatility will not be a good indicator of future volatility 
the expected life of an award is based on historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees  as well as the potential effect from options that had not been exercised at the time 
in accordance with asc no 
 subsequent measurement of stock compensation  we recognize stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  on a ratable basis for all share based payment awards over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period or the remaining service vesting period 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our recorded stock based compensation expense could be different 

table of contents the fair value of market based rsus has been determined by management  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm using the monte carlo simulation method which takes into account multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market conditions stipulated in the award 
this method requires the input of assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  and a risk free interest rate 
compensation expense related to awards that are expected to vest with a market based condition is recognized on a straight line basis regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied  provided that the requisite service has been achieved 
the amount of expense attributed to market based rsus is based on the estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated according to our actual forfeiture rates 
the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  when appropriate  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
to date  our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates 
inventories and inventory valuation we record inventories at the lower of actual cost  or market value 
market value is based upon an estimated average selling price reduced by the estimated costs of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimating average selling prices based up recent sales  industry trends  existing customer orders  and other factors 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to our forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months forecasted demand are written down to zero unless specific facts and circumstances warrant no write down or a write down to a different value and the related provision is recorded as a cost of sales 
once a provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of  even if in subsequent periods we forecast demand for the product 
to the extent our demand forecast for specific products is less than the combination of our product on hand and our non cancelable orders from suppliers  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
if we ultimately sell inventory that we have previously written down  our gross margins in future periods will be positively impacted 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill we test long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest that such assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the asset we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value based primarily upon forecasted discounted cash flows 
these forecasted discounted cash flows include estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 

table of contents we amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives 
we are currently amortizing our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from two to six years 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis on september th using a two step model 
the first step  identifying a potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
management has determined that we have one reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step would need to be conducted  otherwise  no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists 
the second step  measuring the impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
any excess of the goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss  and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value 
in each period presented the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  thus the we were not required to perform the second step of the analysis  and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded investments in privately held companies investments in privately held companies are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine if their values have been impaired and adjustments are recorded as necessary 
we assess the potential impairment of these investments by considering available evidence such as the investee s historical and projected operating results  progress towards meeting business milestones  ability to meet expense forecasts  and the prospects for industry or market in which the investee operates 
upon disposition of these investments  the specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis in computing realized gains or losses 
declines in value that are judged to be other than temporary are reported in interest income and other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carry forwards that are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of asc  income taxes 
under the provisions of asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  utilizing the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets to the amount that we estimate will more likely than not be realized based on available evidence and management s judgment 
in addition  the calculation of liabilities for uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated and 
table of contents no point within the range of probable loss is more likely than other points within the range 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation  and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses 
certain of our licensing agreements indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent  trademark or copyright by third parties related to the intellectual property content of our products 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances  the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu will require us to disclose information about offsetting related arrangements to enable users of our financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on our financial position 
the new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the disclosures required are to be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we do not expect that this standard will materially impact our disclosures included in condensed consolidated financial statements

however  our mhl and hdmi technologies are applied in various pc devices  and we also expect our ghz wirelesshd to be a key technology in the coming years revenue from our mobile products increased from to primarily due to the successful launch of our newest mhl transmitter product 
the revenue growth in our mobile market was partially offset by the decrease in revenue in our ce market 
revenue from our ce market decreased from to primarily due to global macro economic pressures that drove consumers to purchase lower priced ce products  and the magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami that hit japan in march  which has affected both demand in japan and the global supply chain for ce products 
high end dtvs with the latest features and capabilities the market segment where we typically deliver our latest ce innovations have been particularly affected by this trend 
the earthquake in japan had a two fold impact 
first  it reduced demand for higher end tvs in the domestic japanese market 
secondly  as a result of damage to the production facilities  the japanese oem manufacturers shifted a portion of their tv production to original design manufacturers odms outside of japan which typically supply the lower end to mid range dtv market 
our revenue from japan for the year ended december  was as compared to for the same period in licensing revenue our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales and helps us to monetize our intellectual property and accelerate market adoption curves associated with our technology and standards

the increase in deferred margin on sales to distributors was mainly due to the increasing activities with our distributors driven by the acceleration of demand for our products while the decrease in accrued and other current liabilities was mainly attributable to the payment of bonus accrued at the end of and paid in the first quarter of  product rebates and payment of milestone to abt

liquidity and capital resource requirements based on our estimated cash flows  we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we also limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines of our fixed income portfolios 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over a twelve month time horizon 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
these securities are 
table of contents subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the following represents the potential change to the value of our investments given a shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and short term investments and accounts receivable 
a majority of our cash and investments are maintained with a major financial institutions headquartered in the united states 
as part of our cash and investment management processes  we perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions and we have not sustained any credit losses from investments held at these financial institutions 
the counterparties to the agreements relating to our investment securities consist of various major corporations and financial institutions of high credit standing 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and may require collateral  such as letters of credit  to secure accounts receivable if deemed necessary 
we maintain an allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on our assessment of collectability 
foreign currency exchange risk a majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies  primarily the chinese yuan  the japanese yen and the indian rupee 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening or weakening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices or vice versa  for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results 
cash balances held in foreign countries are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the united states 
we assessed the risk of loss in fair values from the impact of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for foreign currency exchange rate risk  a increase or decrease of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a million change in the value of our foreign currency cash accounts 
as of december   we did not have any material derivative transactions
