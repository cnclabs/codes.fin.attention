in addition to expanding our suite of vas  we continue to expand the capacity and capabilities  and to enhance the performance and efficiency  of our global computing platform 
although we believe that we may have improved margins in our content delivery services as we expand our customer base and use a greater proportion of our capacity  we expect the majority of our margin increases to result from our vas increasing as a percentage of our revenue 
on november   we announced the appointment of robert a 
lento as interim chief executive officer effective immediately 
we had previously announced on november  that jeffrey w 
lunsford would be stepping down as our chief executive officer in january and that an executive search firm was engaged to recruit his successor

vonderhaar as chief sales officer and recently appointed jonathan smith as managing director and vice president of europe  middle east and africa 
on february   we announced the appointment of walter d 
amaral to serve as our non executive chairman of the board 
mr 
amaral fills the chairman role vacated by the resignation of mr 
lunsford 
we also announced the appointments of charles kirby wadsworth as our chief marketing officer on june  and indu kodukula as our chief operating officer on october  during  we completed two previously announced stock repurchase plans and commenced a third 
on september   our board authorized and approved a repurchase plan that authorized us to purchase up to million of our shares of common stock  exclusive of any commissions  markups or expenses  from time to time through march  during the period september  through march   we purchased and cancelled approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million million including commissions under the initial repurchase plan 
on may   we announced a second common stock repurchase plan that authorized us to repurchase up to million of our shares of common stock  exclusive of any commissions  markups or expenses  from time to time through december  during the year ended december   we purchased and cancelled approximately million shares of common stock for approximately million million including commissions under the second repurchase plan 
on october   our board of directors authorized and approved a third common stock repurchase plan that authorized us to repurchase up to million of our shares of common stock  exclusive of any commissions  markups or expenses  from time to time through may  any repurchased shares will be cancelled and return to authorized but unissued status 
during the three months ended december   we purchased and cancelled approximately million shares under the third repurchase plan for approximately million including commissions 
on august   the court of appeals for the federal circuit issued its opinion in our on going patent litigation with akamai 
the court of appeals stated that the trial court correctly determined that we did not directly infringe akamai s  patent and upheld the trial court s decision to vacate the original jury s damages award 
the court also held that we did not infringe akamai s  or  patents 
a slim majority in this three way divided opinion also announced a revised legal theory of induced infringement  remanded the case to the trial court  and gave akamai an opportunity for a new trial to attempt to prove that we induced our customers to infringe akamai s patent under the court of appeals new legal standard 
on december   we filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court to appeal this 
table of contents sharply divided court of appeals decision and will seek to stay any proceedings at the trial court until the supreme court rules on that petition 
akamai then filed a cross petition for consideration of the court of appeals standard for direct infringement 
just as we have successfully shown that we do not directly infringe akamai s patent  we firmly believe that we ultimately would be successful in showing we do not infringe akamai s patent under the court of appeals majority s new induced infringement theory  and we will continue to vigorously defend against the allegation 
we do not believe a loss is probable and therefore no provision for this lawsuit is recorded in our financial statements 
for additional information  please see legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
in may  we made a strategic investment in gaikai  a private cloud based gaming technology company 
in august  sony acquired gaikai and we recorded a gain on sale of our cost basis investment in gaikai of million  which has been reflected in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the carrying value of the gaikai cost basis investment as of the sale date was approximately million 
the aggregate selling price was million  consisting of million of cash received and million held in escrow for a period of up to months to cover any potential indemnification claims 
as of december   we are not aware of any potential indemnification claims that are expected to reduce the amount received from escrow and have recorded a current receivable of million which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the year ended december  
table of contents the following table sets forth our historical operating results  as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated 
year ended december  consolidated statement of operations data revenue cost of revenue cost of services depreciation network total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses general and administrative sales and marketing research and development depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating loss other income expense interest expense interest income gain on sale of cost basis investment other  net total other income expense loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit loss from continuing operations discontinued operations loss income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net loss traffic on our network and our vas offerings continued to grow during the year ended december  this traffic growth was primarily the result of growth in the traffic delivered to existing customers and to a lesser extent to new customers 
our content delivery revenue is generated by charging for traffic delivered 
while our traffic continued to grow  our cdn revenue decreased approximately million during when compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower reseller revenue and other non traffic related revenue 
our vas revenue represented substantially all of our revenue growth during the year ended december  during  we continued to add new customers  experienced some attrition and elected not to renew some customers as we continue to focus on customer quality 
our average number of products per customer during the three month period ended december  was for new customers added during the quarter we averaged products 
we continue to have success selling new products to our customer base 
our international revenue continued to grow in  and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on our strategy of expanding our network and customer base internationally 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  revenue derived from customers outside north america accounted for approximately  and respectively  of our total revenue 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  we derived approximately  and  respectively of our international 
table of contents revenue from emea and approximately  and  respectively of our international revenue from asia pacific 
we anticipate that our asia pacific revenue may continue to grow as a percentage of our total international revenue 
during  two countries  japan and the united states accounted for or more of our total revenues 
no single country outside of the united states accounted for or more of our total revenues during the years ended december  and we expect international revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars in our business is managed as a single segment  and we report our financial results on this basis 
during any given fiscal period  a relatively small number of customers typically account for a significant percentage of our revenue 
for example  in  sales to our top customers  in terms of revenue  accounted for approximately of our total revenue 
during and  revenue generated from sales to our top customers  in terms of revenue  accounted for approximately respectively  of our total revenue 
during and  we had one customer  netflix  who accounted for more than of our total revenue 
for each of the years ended december  and  netflix represented approximately of our total revenue 
during  we had no customer that accounted for more than of our total revenue 
in  we anticipate our top customer concentration levels will be consistent with in the past  the customers that comprise our top customers have continually changed  and our large customers may not continue to be as significant going forward as they have been in the past 
in addition to selling to our direct customers  we maintain relationships with a number of resellers that purchase our services for resale to their customers 
revenue generated from sales to reseller customers was approximately   and  respectively of our total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we occasionally generate revenue from certain customers that are entities related to certain of our executive officers and directors 
for the year ended december   revenue generated from these related party transactions was approximately of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   revenue generated from these related party transactions was less than of our total revenue 
for the year ended december   we did not generate any revenue from related parties 
in addition to these revenue related business trends  our cost of revenue increased in absolute dollars and decreased as a percentage of revenue in when compared to the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased payroll and related employee costs for our operations personnel  increased professional fees  and increases in other costs associated with the delivery of our services  as well as additional fees and licenses 
these increases were offset by decreased bandwidth and co location costs  which were primarily due to lower transit costs  offset by an increase in paid peering 
in addition  includes a full year of cost of revenue for clickability  inc clickability and acceloweb il ltd 
acceloweb compared to cost of revenue which includes eight months for clickability and acceloweb which were both acquired in may we enter into contracts with third party network and data center providers  with terms typically ranging from several months to several years 
our contracts related to transit bandwidth provided by network operators generally commit us to pay a fixed monthly fee or monthly fees plus additional fees for bandwidth usage above a specified level 
we entered into an agreement with global crossing in january for use of private lines for additional bandwidth and backbone services with a term of four years from installation 
we executed subsequent amendments in september  march and january for additional bandwidth and backbone services 
the agreement and subsequent amendments required substantial prepayment for such services  and the amendments extended the original term for some services through june in addition to purchasing services from communications providers  we connect directly to approximately broadband isps  generally without either party paying the other 
this industry practice  known as settlement free peering  benefits us by allowing us to place content objects directly on user access networks  which helps us provide higher performance delivery for our customers and eliminate paying transit bandwidth fees to network operators 
this practice also benefits the isp and its customers by allowing them to receive improved content delivery through our local servers and 
table of contents eliminate the cost of transit bandwidth associated with delivery receipt of the traffic 
we do not consider these relationships to represent the culmination of an earnings process 
accordingly  we do not recognize as revenue the value to the isps associated with the use of our servers nor do we recognize as expense the value of the bandwidth received at discounted or no cost 
these peering relationships are mutually beneficial and are not contractual commitments 
in addition to settlement free peering  we incur costs for non settlement free peering as well as costs associated with connecting to the isps 
during  we continued to reduce our network transit bandwidth delivery costs per gigabyte transferred by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions from our existing suppliers associated with higher purchase commitments 
while we had increased traffic delivered over our network  our total transit bandwidth delivery costs decreased during we anticipate our overall transit bandwidth delivery costs will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of expected higher traffic levels  and we expect this increase to be partially offset by continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
we expect that our overall transit bandwidth delivery costs as a percentage of revenue will increase in compared to for the year ended december   operating expenses increased in absolute dollars and increased as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses  increased general and administrative expenses  increased research and development costs  and increased non network related depreciation and amortization 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increased payroll and related employee costs  due to increased staffing  increased travel  increased professional fees  and increased facility and facility related costs  offset by a decrease in share based compensation 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased professional fees  primarily due to increased consulting and outside professional services  legal fees associated with intellectual property and general corporate legal matters  and recruiting costs 
the increase in research and development costs was primarily due to increased payroll and related employee costs due to increased staffing 
the increase in non network related depreciation and amortization was due to increased amortization of intangible assets from our business acquisitions and administrative depreciation and amortization 
for the year ended december   operating expenses included approximately eight months of operating expenses from our may acquisitions of clickability and acceloweb 
we make our capital investment decisions based upon careful evaluation of a number of variables  such as the amount of traffic we anticipate on our network  the cost of the physical infrastructure required to deliver that traffic  and the forecasted capacity utilization of our network 
our capital expenditures have varied over time  in particular  as we purchased servers and other network equipment associated with our network build out 
for example  in   and  we made capital purchases of million  million  and million  respectively  which represented   and  respectively  of total revenue for each of those years 
we expect to have ongoing capital expenditure requirements  as we continue to invest in  refresh and expand our global computing platform 
our future results will be affected by many factors identified in the section captioned risk factors  in this annual report on form k  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  as well as increasing the amount of monthly recurring revenue that we derive from our existing customers  manage the prices we charge for our services  as well as the costs associated with operating our network in light of increased competition  successfully manage our litigation with akamai to a favorable conclusion  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  
table of contents continue to deliver a significant portion of our traffic through settlement free peering relationships which significantly reduce our cost of delivery  successfully integrate the businesses we have acquired  and successfully manage the disposition of businesses we have divested from 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including positive net income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates 
such accounting policies require significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we primarily derive revenue from the sale of content delivery and value added services to our customers 
our customers generally execute contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum commitment 
we define usage as customer data sent or received using our content delivery service  or content that is hosted or cached by us at the request or direction of our customer 
we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our services exceed the monthly minimum commit  we recognize revenue for such excess in the period of the usage 
for annual or other non monthly period revenue commitments  we recognize revenue monthly based upon the customer s actual usage each month of the commitment period and only recognize any remaining committed amount for the applicable period in the last month thereof 
we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated 
we do not charge installation fees for contract renewals 
installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive revenue from services and events sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
we have on occasion entered into multi element arrangements 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if each deliverable has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each deliverable 
arrangements not meeting these criteria are combined into a single unit of accounting 
for services sold in multiple element arrangements  consideration is allocated to each deliverable at the inception of an arrangement based on relative selling prices 
substantially all services are sold on a stand alone basis  providing vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling prices 
in the absence of vsoe or third party evidence of selling prices  consideration would be allocated based on management s best estimate of such prices 

table of contents we recognized approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in revenue under multi element arrangements for the years ended december    and as of december   we had deferred revenue related to these multi element arrangements of approximately million that will be recognized over the remaining terms of the respective arrangements based on the underlying elements of the arrangements in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
we sell services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from reseller arrangements is recognized over the term of the contract  based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
reseller revenue was approximately   and  respectively  of our total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an assessment as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense or deferred revenue for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees  prepayments made by customers for future periods  and deferred installation fees 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
we record reserves as a reduction of our accounts receivable balance for service credits and for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used in determining both of these reserves 
the allowance for doubtful accounts charges are included as a component of general and administrative expenses 
our reserve for service credits relates to service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business  as well as for billing disputes 
these credits typically relate to customer disputes and billing adjustments and are estimated at the time the revenue is recognized and recorded as a reduction of revenues 
estimates for service credits are based on an analysis of credits issued in previous periods 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a calculation that uses our aging of accounts receivable and applies a reserve percentage to the specific age of the receivable to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the reserve percentages are determined based on our historical write off experience 
these estimates could change significantly if our customers financial condition changes or if the economy in general deteriorates 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in the deferral of revenue until payment is made or we determine payment is reasonably assured 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
as of december  and  we concluded that we had one reporting unit and assigned the entire balance of goodwill to this reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using our market capitalization as of october  and we performed an impairment test of goodwill as of each of such date and the tests did not indicate an impairment of goodwill 
other intangible assets consist of existing technologies  customer relationships  trade names  and trademarks 
purchased intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the estimated economic value derived from the related intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets is included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such events occur  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if this comparison indicates that impairment is present  the amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
if a readily determinable market price does not exist  fair value is estimated using discounted expected cash flows attributable to the asset 
the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets  the useful lives of these assets  and expected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 
contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
deferred taxes and tax reserves our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect during the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or the carryforwards are expected to be realized 
the company currently has net deferred tax assets consisting of net operating loss nol carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
management periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our recent cumulative losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes in the period of such realization 
the company has recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving its income tax and sales and use tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions 
the company s estimate of the value of its tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that the company estimated 
uncertainty in income taxes is recognized in the company s financial statements under guidance that prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our unrecognized tax benefit 
table of contents from uncertain tax positions increased from january  to december  we anticipate that our unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within twelve months of the reporting date  as audits or reviews are initiated or settled and as a result of settling potential tax liabilities in certain foreign jurisdictions 
it is not currently reasonably possible to estimate the range of change 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our tax provision 
our effective tax rate is influenced by the recognition of tax positions pursuant to the more likely than not standard that such positions will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority 
in addition  other factors such as changes in tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions  and significant changes in our operations through acquisitions or divestitures can have a material impact on the effective tax rate 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known 
we conduct business in various foreign countries 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in multiple locations  and the calculation of our foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for united states or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation awards using the fair value method 
the grant date fair value was determined using the black scholes merton pricing model 
the black scholes merton valuation calculation requires us to make key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates  and dividend yield 
our expected volatility is derived from our volatility rate as a publicly traded company and historical volatilities of similar public companies within the internet services and network industry 
each company s historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor used by us 
we do not have enough historical experience as a public company to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term  therefore  expected term is calculated using the short cut method  which takes into consideration the grant s contractual life and the vesting periods 
the risk free interest factor is based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for zero coupon united states treasury notes with maturities of approximately equal to each grant s expected term 
we develop an estimate of the number of share based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
annual changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based payments expense  as the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and therefore  we have assumed a dividend yield 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility  and forfeiture rate related to our own share based awards on a prospective basis  and in incorporating these factors into the model 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 

table of contents we apply the straight line attribution method to recognize compensation costs associated with awards that are not subject to graded vesting 
for awards that are subject to graded vesting and performance based awards  we recognize compensation costs separately for each vesting tranche 
we also estimate when and if performance based awards will be earned 
if an award is not considered probable of being earned  no amount of stock based compensation is recognized 
if the award is deemed probable of being earned  related compensation expense is recorded over the estimated service period 
to the extent our estimates of awards considered probable of being earned changes  the amount of stock based compensation recognized will also change 
results of continuing operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands revenue revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in our vas revenue of approximately million 
our vas revenue  which collectively refers to our mobility  web and video content management  web application acceleration  cloud storage  and consulting revenue  includes revenue from the date of acquisition of delve networks  inc delve  clickability  and acceloweb 
the increase in vas revenue was primarily attributable to increases in our web content management  video publishing  and cloud storage revenue 
the increase in vas revenue was offset by a decrease in our content delivery services revenue 
during  we continued to increase the amount of traffic moving through our network  however  we also saw price compression 
our content delivery services revenue decreased approximately million 
the decrease was primarily due to lower reseller revenue and other non traffic related revenue 
in addition  approximately million was due to a reduction in our network pop build and license revenue from microsoft 
as of december   we had  customers compared to  as of december  the decrease in customers count was primarily attributable to the loss of smaller revenue generating customers 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were derived from our operations located outside of north america 
for the years ended december  and  we derived approximately and  respectively  of our international revenue from emea and approximately and  respectively  of our international revenue from asia pacific 
during  two countries  japan and the united states  respectively  accounted for or more of our total revenues 
during  no single country outside of the united states accounted for or more of our total revenues 
we anticipate revenues will increase in we expect to deliver more traffic on our network and expect continued growth in our vas 
additionally  we expect our international revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars and that our asia pacific revenue may continue to grow as a percentage of our total international revenue compared to we anticipate that our customer concentrations levels will be consistent with 
table of contents cost of revenue year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and backbone  costs incurred for non settlement free peering and connection to isps  and fees paid to data center operators for housing of our network equipment in third party network data centers  also known as co location costs 
cost of revenue also includes depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our content delivery services  payroll and related costs and share based compensation for our network operations  and professional services personnel 
cost of revenue increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related employee costs of approximately million primarily associated with increased salaries and bonus accrual  increased professional fees of approximately million  consisting of approximately million of consulting fees and approximately million of recruiting fees  and an increase in other costs of approximately million 
the increase in other costs was primarily due to million of other costs associated with the delivery of our services and increased fees and licenses of approximately million 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately million in bandwidth and co location fees

use of non gaap financial measures to evaluate our business  we consider and use non gaap net income loss and adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
these measures include the same adjustments that management takes into account when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period to period basis 
we consider non gaap net income loss to be an important indicator of overall business performance because it allows us to illustrate the impact of the effects of share based compensation  litigation expenses  amortization of intangibles  acquisition related expenses  gain on sales of cost basis investment  and discontinued operations

we believe that ebitda provides a useful metric to investors to compare us with other companies within our industry and across industries 
we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for operational expenses that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance 
we also believe use of adjusted ebitda facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period 
in addition  it should be noted that our performance based executive officer bonus structure is tied closely to our performance as measured in part by certain non gaap financial measures 
in our february  earnings press release  as furnished on form k  we included non gaap net income loss  ebitda  and adjusted ebitda 
the terms non gaap net income loss  ebitda  and adjusted ebitda are not defined under united states gaap  and are not measures of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with united states gaap 
our non gaap net loss  ebitda  and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and when assessing our operating performance  non gaap net income loss  ebitda  and adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for net income loss or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with united states gaap 
some of these limitations include  but are not limited to ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  they do not reflect the cash requirements necessary for litigation costs  they do not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt that we may incur  they do not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  while share based compensation is a component of operating expense  the impact on our financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and the assumed volatility of our common stock  and other companies may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap net income loss and adjusted ebitda only as supplemental support for management s analysis of business performance 
non gaap net income loss  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated as follows for the periods presented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio 
in our investment portfolio  we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our investments are primarily with our commercial and investment banks and  by policy  we limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds  united states treasury obligations  high quality corporate and municipal obligations  and certificates of deposit 
our outstanding capital lease obligations bear fixed interest rates and fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income  operating results  or liquidity 
foreign currency risk we operate in north america  emea and asia pacific  including japan 
as a result of our international business activities  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure on our results of operations as it relates to revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
a portion of our cost of revenues and operating expenses are denominated in foreign currencies as are revenues associated with certain international customers 
to the extent that the us dollar weakens  similar foreign currency denominated transactions in the future will result in higher revenues and higher cost of revenues and operating expenses  with expenses having the greater impact on our financial results 
similarly  our revenues and expenses will decrease if the us dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
we performed a sensitivity analysis of our foreign currency exposure as of december  to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates for all foreign denominated revenues and expenses 
assuming a weakening of the us dollar relative to our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses  our net loss for the year ended december  would have been higher by approximately million 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements across multiple jurisdictions are similar and would be linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex markets or other changes that could arise which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations 
as of december   our international subsidiaries had the us dollar as their functional currencies 
during the first quarter of  we analyzed the various economic factors of our international subsidiaries and determined that the operations of our subsidiaries that were previously determined to operate in a us dollar functional currency environment had changed and that their functional currencies should be changed to the local currencies 
effective january   the adjustment from translating these subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency to the us dollar was recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these foreign currency translation adjustments reflect the translation of the balance sheet at period end exchange rates and the income statement at an average exchange rate in effect during each period 
upon the change in functional currency  we recorded a cumulative translation adjustment of approximately million  which is included in the consolidated balance sheet 
because of the change in exchange rates between reporting periods and changes in certain account balances  the foreign currency translation adjustment will change from period to period 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
