item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading  less than truckload ltl  union free motor carrier providing regional  inter regional and national ltl service and other value added services from a single integrated organization 
in addition to our core ltl services  we offer our customers a broad range of value added services including ground and air expedited transportation  container delivery  truckload brokerage  supply chain consulting  warehousing and consumer household pickup and delivery services 
we also offer worldwide freight forwarding services 
more than of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers  whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 
in analyzing the components of our revenue  we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics revenue per hundredweight this measurement reflects the application of our pricing policies to the services we provide  which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives 
generally  freight is rated by a class system  which is established by the national motor freight traffic association  inc light  bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense  heavy freight 
fuel surcharges  accessorial charges  revenue adjustments and revenue for undelivered freight are included in this measurement 
revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  however  we believe including it in our revenue per hundredweight metrics results in a better indicator of changes in our yields by matching total billed revenue with the corresponding weight of those shipments 
revenue per hundredweight is a commonly used indicator of pricing trends  but this metric can be influenced by many other factors  such as changes in fuel surcharges  weight per shipment  length of haul and the mix of our freight 
as a result  changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying base rates 
weight per shipment fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the class  or mix  of freight we receive from our customers  as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment 
generally  increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers products and overall increased economic activity 
changes in weight per shipment generally have an inverse effect on our revenue per hundredweight  as an increase in weight per shipment will typically cause a decrease in revenue per hundredweight 
average length of haul we consider lengths of haul less than miles to be regional traffic  lengths of haul between miles and  miles to be inter regional traffic  and lengths of haul in excess of  miles to be national traffic 
by analyzing this metric  we can determine the success and growth potential of our service products in these markets 
changes in length of haul generally have a direct effect on our revenue per hundredweight  as an increase in length of haul will typically cause an increase in revenue per hundredweight 
our primary revenue focus is to increase our density  our shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure  which allows us to maximize our asset utilization and labor productivity 
we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center  linehaul load factor  pickup and delivery p d stops per hour  p d shipments per hour  platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour 
in addition to our focus on density  it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle 
we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability 
we believe yield management and improvements in density are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 
our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight  fuel and equipment repair expenses  and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 
we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue  which also allows industry wide comparisons with our competition 
we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs 
our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network  increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  expenses and other items as a percentage of revenue from operations revenue from operations operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits operating supplies and expenses general supplies and expenses operating taxes and licenses insurance and claims communication and utilities depreciation and amortization purchased transportation building and office equipment rents miscellaneous expenses  net total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income for the purpose of this table  interest expense is presented net of interest income

revenue per hundredweight revenue per shipment average length of haul miles our financial results were driven by strong growth in our revenue  which exceeded billion for the first time in our company history 
in addition to our company record for annual revenue  we also achieved company records for our annual operating ratio and earnings per diluted share 
we experienced strong growth in both tonnage and revenue per hundredweight  while also improving the efficiency of our operations  all of which led to margin improvement over the previous year 
as a result  our operating ratio improved to and net income increased to million for we believe our success in was primarily the result of our ability to win market share by providing shippers with a value proposition that consists of providing best in class on time and claims free service at a fair and equitable price 
our commitment to this value proposition should allow us to continue to increase our tonnage and market share 
revenue our revenue growth during of was driven by increases in tonnage and pricing 
tonnage increased primarily due to a increase in shipments and a increase in weight per shipment for the periods compared 
we believe the increase in shipments during the year was primarily due to increased market share  as our growth exceeded reported industry levels 
revenue per hundredweight increased to in this increase reflects our disciplined yield management process as well as an improved pricing environment 
revenue per hundredweight is a good indicator of pricing trends  but this metric is influenced by many other factors  such as changes in fuel surcharges  weight per shipment  length of haul and mix of freight  therefore  changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying rates 
our revenue per hundredweight  excluding fuel surcharges  increased in despite the negative influence of the increase in weight per shipment and decrease in length of haul 
fuel surcharge revenue increased to of revenue in from in  primarily due to a slight increase in the average price per gallon for diesel fuel 
most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge  which is recorded as additional revenue  as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
these levels are generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers  although it is generally considered to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products we use 
we regularly monitor the components of our pricing  including base freight rates and fuel surcharges 
we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 
operating costs and other expenses salaries  wages and benefits increased million  or in due to a million increase in the costs for salaries and wages and a million increase in benefit costs 
the increase in the costs for our salaries and wages  excluding benefits  was due primarily to a increase in average full time employees over and the impact of wage increases provided to employees in september and the increase in our headcount was necessary to ensure adequate labor capacity for the increase in shipments during as well as for projected growth 
as a result  our direct labor costs for drivers  platform employees and fleet technicians increased million  or in as compared to although these costs increased during  our salaries and wages as a percent of revenue improved to from in as a result of the increased density and efficiency in our operations 
our platform pounds handled per hour  p d stops per hour and p d shipments per hour improved  and  respectively  over the prior year period 
employee benefit costs increased million primarily due to an increase in the number of full time employees eligible for benefits  an increase in paid time off for employees and an increase in the cost per employee for our group health and dental plans 
as a percentage of salaries and wages  employee benefit costs increased slightly to in from in operating supplies and expenses increased million in primarily due to the increases in the costs of diesel fuel  excluding fuel taxes  which represents the largest component of operating supplies and expenses 
diesel fuel costs can vary based on both consumption and average price per gallon  both of which increased over gallons consumed and average price per gallon increased and  respectively  in as compared to although we saw increases in these costs  operating supplies and expenses decreased as a percent of revenue to in from in we attribute this improvement primarily to certain operational initiatives and the increased use of newer  more fuel efficient equipment during we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to of revenue in as compared to in this increase was primarily due to the increase in our capital expenditure program for  which included a significant increase in the number of tractors and trailers purchased 
in addition  our unit costs for tractors have increased significantly  due primarily to the impact of increasingly stringent emission standard requirements 
since  the average cost of a new tractor in our fleet has increased approximately  or 
although our capital expenditure plan for is projected to be lower than  we expect our continued growth and investments to increase depreciation costs in future periods 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to in our effective tax rate in was favorably impacted by tax credits related to our investment in alternative energy producing assets and alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations 
these alternative fuel tax credits expired on december   however  congress retroactively reinstated these credits for and extended the credits through december  by passing the american taxpayer relief act of on january  the impact of the retroactive application will be recorded as a favorable discrete tax benefit during the first quarter of compared to key financial and operating metrics for and are presented below change change work days revenue in thousands operating ratio net income in thousands diluted earnings per share total tons in thousands total shipments in thousands weight per shipment lbs 
revenue per hundredweight revenue per shipment average length of haul miles we experienced strong growth in both tonnage and revenue per hundredweight  and we improved our productivity  all of which led to significant margin improvement during tonnage growth in was primarily the result of our ability to win market share as well as a slight improvement in the overall us economy 
we believe our consistent strategy of providing best in class on time and claims free service at a fair and equitable price resonates with shippers and will continue to help us win market share and fuel our growth 
our ability to win market share is supported by our belief that shippers are making decisions based more on the overall value of the service they receive rather than focusing simply on prices 
this change in philosophy occurred as many of our competitors implemented significant rate increases in and while we implemented a modest rate increase in  we did not believe we had the headwinds that many of our competitors faced in making pricing decisions in as a result  we believe the quality of our service and the consistency of our pricing is a winning strategy that will continue to provide opportunities for us to increase tonnage and market share in the increase in revenue during  as well as productivity improvements  enabled us to leverage our fixed cost network and generate significant improvement in our operating results 
our net income increased in by million  or  to million and our operating ratio decreased by basis points to 
revenue the increase in revenue during was the result of increases in both tonnage and revenue per hundredweight 
tonnage increased due to a increase in shipments that was partially offset by a decrease in weight per shipment 
while a decrease in weight per shipment has historically been an indicator of weakness in the economy  we believe the decrease we experienced in was due to a decline in the number of heavier non traditional ltl shipments  such as full container load and truckload shipments  as a percent of our total shipments 
revenue per hundredweight increased to in this change reflects an improved ltl pricing environment that supported our rate increases  as well as an increase in fuel surcharges 
our fuel surcharges are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleum based products and are one of many components included in the overall price for our services 
revenue per hundredweight is a good indicator of pricing trends  but this metric is influenced by many other factors  such as changes in fuel surcharges  weight per shipment  length of haul and mix of freight  therefore  changes in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual changes in underlying rates 
our revenue per hundredweight  excluding fuel surcharges  increased in but was positively influenced by the decrease in weight per shipment and an increase in length of haul 
fuel surcharge revenue increased to of revenue from in due to the increased price of diesel fuel during most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge  which is recorded as additional revenue  as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels

we also address any individual account profitability issues with our customers as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 
operating costs and other expenses salaries  wages and benefits increased million or in  which compares favorably with our revenue growth of 
as a result  our salaries  wages and benefits improved to of revenue from in salaries and wages  excluding benefits  increased million due to a increase in the total number of full time employees and the impact from salary and wage increases provided to our employees in september and in addition  there was an increase in performance based compensation due to the improvement in our financial and operational results 
these increases were partially offset by the improved productivity of our linehaul  p d and platform operations that resulted from increased density and a continued focus on efficiency 
our linehaul laden load average  p d shipments per hour and platform pounds handled per hour improved  and  respectively 
employee benefit costs increased million primarily due to an increase in the number of full time employees  increased costs related to our group health plan and higher payroll related taxes 
as a percentage of salaries and wages  employee benefit costs increased slightly to in from in our group health plan requires a day waiting period before newly hired employees are eligible to enroll 
a significant number of employees were hired in the second half of  and as a result  our group health costs increased as these new employees began to enroll in our plan in in addition  our group health costs increased due to changes required by the patient protection and affordable care act  which required us to provide dependant coverage until the age of operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase is primarily due to the increase in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses 
these costs increased during the year as a result of the combined effect of a increase in our average price per gallon and a increase in gallons consumed 
the increase in fuel consumption is primarily due to a year over year increase in overall miles driven that was partially offset by an improvement in our average miles per gallon 
our increased fuel consumption also resulted in an increase in our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the million increase in operating taxes and licenses 
we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to of revenue in as compared to in although our capital expenditure requirements increased in  we were able to offset the cost of these additions by utilizing the available capacity of our fleet and service center network to create operating leverage on the increase in tonnage 
our capital expenditure plan for is projected to be higher than and  as a result  our depreciation costs will likely increase in future periods 
we purchase linehaul transportation and p d services from other motor carriers and railroads 
we also utilize independent contractors for our container operations 
we utilize these services when it is economically beneficial or when there are imbalances of freight flow within our service center network 
purchased transportation expense remained consistent at of revenue in and as it is typically more efficient and profitable for us to utilize our own personnel and equipment  we expect to continue to focus on balancing our internal resources with freight demand in an effort to reduce our use of purchased transportation in future periods 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to in our effective tax rates in and were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations 
these fuel tax credits were originally scheduled to expire on december   however  they were extended to december  with the passage of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of our rate also included the favorable impact of tax credits related to our investment in alternative energy producing assets 
liquidity and capital resources a summary of our cash flows is presented below in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year the changes in our cash flows provided by operating activities for the periods presented above are due primarily to the significant improvement in our net income  which increased million in and million in over the comparable periods in and  respectively 
this increase is more fully described above in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
depreciation and amortization expenses also increased million in and million in over the comparable periods of and  respectively  which is primarily due to the ongoing execution of our capital expenditure program and more fully described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures 
changes in cash flows used in investing activities are primarily due to changes in our capital expenditures over the periods compared 
the changes in our capital expenditure program are more fully described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures 
changes in cash flows used in or provided by financing activities consist of fluctuations in our senior unsecured revolving line of credit  scheduled principal payments under our long term debt agreements  and debt and equity issuances during in  we completed a million private placement of senior notes  and we received net proceeds of million resulting from the issuance of our common stock  both of which are discussed in more detail below 
a portion of the proceeds from these transactions was used to satisfy the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving line of credit 
we have three primary sources of available liquidity cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement  which is described below 
we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide other sources of liquidity  if needed 
on january   we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued million of privately placed senior notes 
we entered into this note purchase agreement to fund planned capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
we used a portion of the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness  including paying down the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 
pursuant to an automatic shelf registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec  we filed a prospectus supplement and entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement on february  with stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated stifel nicolaus weisel  under which we had the ability to issue and sell  from time to time over a month period through or to stifel nicolaus weisel  shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million the atm program 
from february  through december   we issued  shares of common stock pursuant to the atm program at an average price of per share  after adjusting for a three for two stock split effected on september  we received aggregate gross proceeds of million and aggregate net proceeds of million  after deducting commissions and other transaction costs of million 
there were no subsequent issuances pursuant to the atm program through february   which was the date on which the atm program expired 
our automatic shelf registration statement that provided us with the opportunity to offer and sell shares of common stock on a delayed or continuous basis at indeterminate prices expired in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment  including those obtained through capital leases  for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands land and structures tractors trailers technology other less proceeds from sales total our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the projected increase in the number and size of our service center facilities to support our plan for long term growth  our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and anticipated tonnage growth 
expenditures for land and structures increased in as we expanded the capacity of our service center network  which included the expansion of two of our major breakbulk facilities 
our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers increased significantly in and to support our projected tonnage growth as well as to replace equipment being retired through our normal replacement cycle 
in  we limited our purchases of these assets as we had sufficient capacity to meet demand 
we currently estimate capital expenditures  net of anticipated proceeds from sales  will be approximately million for the year ending december  approximately million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities  construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities  subject to the availability of suitable real estate and the timing of construction projects  approximately million is allocated for the purchase of tractors  trailers and other equipment  and approximately million is allocated for investments in technology and other assets 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations  our existing cash and cash equivalents and the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility  if needed 
we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 
we anticipate that there will be additional environmental regulations and legislation resulting from the increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
at this time  we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations 
however  any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
financing agreements we have a five year  million senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of a second amended and restated credit agreement dated august  the credit agreement  with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo serving as administrative agent for the lenders 
of the million line of credit commitments  million may be used for letters of credit and million may be used for borrowings under the wells fargo sweep plus loan program 
this sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of million 
in addition  we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of million in minimum increments of million 
at our option  revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either a the applicable margin percentage for base rate loans plus the higher of wells fargo s prime rate  the federal funds rate plus per annum  or the one month libor rate plus per annum  b the libor rate plus the applicable margin percentage for libor loans  or c the libor market index rate libor index rate plus the applicable margin percentage for libor market index loans 
the applicable margin percentage is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from to 
the applicable margin percentage was at december  and  respectively  and ranged from to during revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants  including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
any future wholly owned subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility 
the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities are presented below december  in thousands facility limit line of credit borrowings outstanding letters of credit total borrowing capacity commitment fees ranging from to are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement 
letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter 
the commitment fees ranged from to and letter of credit fees ranged from to during in addition  a facing fee at an annual rate of is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 
we have three outstanding unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of million at december  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities that range from to  of which million is due in the next twelve months 
interest rates on these notes are fixed and range from to 
the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was and at december  and  respectively 
with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement  interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments 
therefore  short term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility 
we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i million  ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year  or iii an amount equal to of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in or  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability 
most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance  which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future  and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and long term capital needs 
common stock split on august   we announced a three for two common stock split for shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date  august  on september   those shareholders received one additional share of common stock for every two shares owned

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations  exclusive of interest capital lease obligations  exclusive of interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations include long term debt consisting of senior notes totaling million and million outstanding on our credit agreement  capital lease obligations for computer equipment  operating leases consisting primarily of real estate leases  and purchase obligations relating to non cancellable purchase orders for equipment scheduled for delivery in please refer to the information regarding interest rates and the balance on our revolving credit facility in this section above and also in note to the financial statements included in item of this report 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these critical accounting policies are further described in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract  our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers 
generally  this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment 
for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period  we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period 
under this method  we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment s standard delivery time schedule 
this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 
allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables  our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers 
we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date 
write offs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 
we also maintain an allowance for estimated revenue adjustments resulting from future billing corrections  customer allowances  money back service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments 
these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations 
we use historical experience  trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage  bipd  workers compensation  long term disability  group health and dental not covered by insurance 
the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers compensation  long term disability  group health and dental  which are charged to employee benefits expense 
insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors 
as a result  we periodically evaluate our self insured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance between our retention exposure and excess coverage 
in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical claims development experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable  however  any changes in the severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
we use historical experience  certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset 
periodically  we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions  and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 
effective january   estimated economic lives for structures are to years  revenue equipment is to years  other equipment is to years  and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 
during the first quarter of  we completed an evaluation of the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our equipment and determined that the actual period of service of certain revenue equipment exceeded that of our previously estimated useful lives 
as a result  we extended the estimated useful lives of most of our tractors to years from years and extended the estimated useful lives of our trailers to years from years 
in addition  we reduced the estimated salvage values associated with this equipment to more accurately reflect the value we believe such equipment will have at the end of its respective useful life 
we made similar changes to the estimated useful lives and salvage values for certain of our other equipment but the results of these changes had less of an impact on our future depreciation expense 
as a result of the impact on depreciation from these changes that were effective january   income from continuing operations and net income in increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which typically results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base  which is generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
volatility in the price of diesel fuel  independent of inflation  has impacted our business  as described in this report 
however  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years
