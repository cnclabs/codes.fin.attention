introduction the pep boys manny  moe jack and subsidiaries the company has been the best place to shop and care for your car since it began operations in over  associates are focused on delivering the best customer service in the automotive aftermarket to our customers across our locations located throughout the united states and puerto rico 
pep boys satisfies all of a customer automotive needs through our unique offering of service  tires  parts and accessories

supercenters average approximately  square feet our new supercenter format is approximately  square feet and combine do it for me service labor  installed merchandise and tire offerings difm with do it yourself parts and accessories diy 
most of our supercenters also have a commercial sales program that delivers parts  tires and equipment to automotive repair shops and dealers 
service tire centers  which average approximately  square feet  provide difm services in neighborhood locations that are conveniently located where our customers live or work 
service tire centers are designed to capture market share and leverage our existing supercenters and support infrastructure 
we also operate a handful of legacy diy only pep express stores 
in fiscal  we opened service tire centers and six supercenters and converted one pep express store into a supercenter 
we also closed four service tire centers and two supercenters

executive summary net earnings for fiscal were million  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  reported for fiscal excluding certain unusual items  the year over year decrease in profitability was primarily due to lower total gross profit margins and higher selling  general and administrative expenses  partially offset by increased sales resulting from the rd week in fiscal and reduced interest expense 
total revenues excluding the additional week in fiscal declined by or million  as compared to the same period in the prior year due to a decline in comparable store sales sales generated by locations in operation during the same period of the prior year which was partially offset by increased contribution from our non comparable store locations 
this decrease in comparable store 
table of contents sales was comprised of a increase in comparable store service revenue offset by a decrease in comparable store merchandise sales 
we believe that the industry fundamentals of increasing vehicle complexity and customer preference for difm remain solid over the long term resulting in consistent demand for maintenance and repair services 
consistent with this long term trend  we have adopted a long term strategy of growing our automotive service business  while maintaining our diy customer base by offering the newest and broadest product assortment in the automotive aftermarket 
in the short term  however  we believe the challenging macroeconomic environment  including persistent high unemployment and negative consumer confidence in the overall us economy  negatively impacted our fiscal year sales 
another macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry is gasoline prices 
gasoline prices have not only increased to historical highs in recent years  but have also experienced significant spikes in prices during each year 
we believe that these gasoline price trends challenged our customer spending relative to discretionary and deferrable purchases 
given the nature of these macroeconomic factors  we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends may continue  nor can we predict to what degree these trends will affect us in the future 
our primary response to fluctuations in customer demand is to adjust our product assortment  store staffing and advertising messages 
in the challenging macroeconomic environment that our customers have experienced in the last few years  we leaned toward a needs based product assortment  reduced staffing levels and delivered a promotional advertising message 
in addition  we work continuously to make it easy for customers to choose us to do it for them and to expand our online efforts to make pep boys the most convenient place to shop for all of their automotive needs 
in fiscal  we reached another e serve milestone with the launch of buy on line  ship to home  which complements our previously implemented on line capabilities of service appointment scheduling  treadsmart tires from information to installation and buy on line  pick up in store 
we are encouraged that during calendar year  miles driven  which favorably impacts sales of our services and non discretionary products  grew  after declining in for fiscal and beyond  we are focusing our efforts on ensuring that pep boys is the best place to shop and care for your car and are moving our entire business model towards a more focused customer centered strategy

while our total revenues were favorably impacted by the opening of new stores  a new store is not added to our comparable store sales until it reaches its th month of operation 
the additional week of fiscal and non comparable stores contributed an additional million of total revenue in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
total merchandise sales increased  or million  to  million for fiscal  compared to  million for fiscal excluding the fifty third week in  comparable merchandise sales decreased by  or million 
the decrease in comparable store merchandise sales was driven primarily by lower comparable store customer counts partially offset by a higher average transaction amount per customer and was comprised of a decline in merchandise sold through our retail business and a decrease in merchandise sold through our service business resulting primarily from lower tire sales 
the fifty third week and our non comparable stores contributed an additional million of merchandise sales

the increase in comparable store service revenue was due to higher customer counts partially offset by a decrease in the average transaction amount per customer 
the fifty third week and our non comparable stores contributed an additional million of service revenue 
in our retail business  we believe that the difficult macroeconomic conditions continue to impact our customers and led to the comparable store customer counts decline  while we experienced an increase in the average transaction amount per customer resulting from higher selling prices 
in our service business  we believe that we experienced an increase in comparable store customer counts due to the strength of our service offering and our promotion of oil changes 
however  this shift in service sales mix towards lower cost oil changes reduced the average transaction amount per service customer

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase resulted primarily from higher media expense of million  higher store and administrative payroll and related expense of million partially from the additional week in fiscal and higher legal and professional services costs of million  which were partially offset by lower credit card transaction fees of million and the reversal of compensation expense of million related to previously issued performance based stock grants 
in addition  in fiscal we recorded a reduction to the contingent consideration of million related to one of our acquisitions 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we terminated our proposed go private transaction and recorded the settlement proceeds  net of merger related costs  of million in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we restructured our long term debt to reduce the amount outstanding by million and lower our annual interest expense by approximately million 
accordingly  the write off of deferred financing costs along with the cost to settle the interest rate swap on the previous debt  partially offset by our lower total debt and reduced interest rate  caused our interest expense for fiscal to increase by million to million as compared to the million for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold our regional administration building in los angeles  ca  which resulted in a net gain from disposition of assets to increase by million in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in accordance with internal revenue service and pension benefit guaranty corporation requirements  we contributed million to fully fund its defined benefit pension plan on a termination basis and incurred a settlement charge of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our income tax expense for fiscal was million  or an effective rate of  as compared to an expense of million  or an effective rate of  for fiscal the change was primarily due to a benefit of million related to the release of valuation allowances on certain state net operating loss carry forwards and credits in fiscal in addition  the rate change from period to period is primarily driven by a reduction in ordinary income or loss in relation to foreign taxes in our puerto rico operations  state taxes  and other certain permanent tax items

table of contents fiscal vs 
fiscal total revenue for fiscal increased by  or million  to  million from  million in fiscal  while comparable store sales for fiscal decreased as compared to the prior year 
this decrease in comparable store sales consisted of an increase of in comparable store service revenue offset by a decrease of in comparable store merchandise sales 
total comparable store sales decreased due to lower customer counts in all three lines of business partially offset by an increase in the average transaction amount per customer

total service revenue increased  or million  to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
the increase in service revenue was comprised of a million  or  increase in comparable store service revenue and million of service revenue from our new non comparable stores 
we believe that comparable store customer counts decreased due to macroeconomic conditions  while the average transaction amount per customer increased due to selling price increases implemented to reflect the inflation in product acquisition costs 
we believe the significant increase in gasoline prices led to a decline in miles driven  which combined with the financial burden of higher gasoline prices  continued high unemployment and negative consumer confidence in the overall us economy depressed our fiscal sales 
these negative economic conditions were somewhat mitigated by the continued aging of the us light vehicle fleet as consumers spent more money on maintaining their vehicles as opposed to buying new vehicles 
over the long term  we believe utilizing innovative marketing programs to communicate our value priced  differentiated service and merchandise assortment will drive increased customer counts and our continued focus on delivering a better customer experience than our competitors will convert those increased customer counts into sales improvements consistently over all lines of business 
total gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal total gross profit margin decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in total gross profit margin was primarily due to the opening or acquisition of new service tire centers

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily due to higher general liability and workers compensation claims expense of million related to a favorable actuarial based adjustment in the prior year  higher travel costs from increased gasoline prices related to our commercial fleet of million  and acquisition  transition and merger related costs of million

generally  specialized automotive retailers focus on either the service or retail area of the business 
we believe that operation in both the service and retail areas positively differentiates us from most of our competitors 
although we manage our performance at a store level in aggregation  we believe that the following presentation  which includes the reclassification of revenue from merchandise that we install in customer vehicles to service center revenue  shows an accurate comparison against competitors within the two sales arenas 
we compete in the retail area of the business through our retail sales floor and commercial sales business 
our service center business competes in the service area of the industry

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our pension plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns and warranty obligations  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  share based compensation  risk participation agreements  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements inventory is stated at lower of cost  as determined under the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
our inventory  which consists primarily of automotive parts and accessories  is used on vehicles 
because of the relatively long lives of vehicles  along with our historical experience of returning most excess inventory to our vendors for full credit  the risk of obsolescence is minimal 
we establish a reserve for excess inventory for instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs 
the reserve is based on management judgment  including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products  the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods and on historical experiences where we received less than full credit from vendors for product returns 
if our estimates regarding excess inventory are inaccurate  we may incur losses or gains that could be material 
a difference in our inventory reserves as of february  would have affected net earnings by approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents we record reserves for future sales returns  customer incentives  warranty claims and inventory shrinkage 
the reserves are based on expected returns of products and historical claims and inventory shrinkage experience 
if actual experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required 
a change in these reserves at february  would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal we have risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation  general liability  automobile liability  other casualty coverage and health care insurance  including stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
a reserve for the liabilities associated with these agreements is established using generally accepted actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
the amounts included in our costs related to these arrangements are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions  claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at february  would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal at fiscal year end  we had six reporting units  of which three included goodwill 
we test the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
more frequent impairment reviews may be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances affecting our business 
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two step process  if necessary 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets 
any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
a deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models  but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses  including  but not limited to  the estimated cost of capital and or discount rates 
additionally  in accordance with accounting guidance  we are required to ensure that assumptions used to determine fair value in the analyses are consistent with the assumptions a market participant would use 
as a result  the cost of capital and or discount rates used may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends  regardless of whether our cost of capital has changed 
therefore we may recognize an impairment even though cash flows are approximately the same or greater than forecasted amounts 
there were no impairments as a result of our annual tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  fiscal year  and fiscal year we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management judgments  including judgments related to store cash flows  are based on market and operating conditions at the time of evaluation 
future events could cause management conclusion on impairment to change  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we have a share based compensation plan  which includes stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus 
we account for our share based compensation plans on a fair value basis 
we 
table of contents determine the fair value of our stock options at the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the rsus are awarded at a price equal to the market price of our underlying stock on the date of the grant 
in situations where we have granted stock options and rsus with market conditions  we have used monte carlo simulations in estimating the fair value of the award 
the pricing model and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include the expected life of stock options  expected stock price volatility  future employee stock option exercise behaviors and the estimate of award forfeitures 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are different from these assumptions  the share based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share based compensation 
in addition  significant changes in these assumptions could materially impact our share based compensation expense on future awards 
a change in our share based compensation expense for fiscal would have affected net earnings by approximately million 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories  for tax and accounting purposes 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on federal and state tax laws and regulations currently in effect 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase our transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our state income tax expense and our state income taxes paid  which could have a material effect on our net earnings 
at any one time our tax returns for many tax years are subject to examination by us federal  commonwealth  and state taxing jurisdictions 
for income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
we adjust these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases  and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent our actual tax liability differs from our established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  our effective tax rate may be materially impacted 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of  the timing of  or the tax treatment of any particular tax position or deduction  we believe that our tax balances reflect the more likely than not outcome of known tax contingencies 
the temporary differences between the book and tax treatment of income and expenses result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a future period  income tax expense will be impacted 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods from either operations or projected tax planning strategies 

table of contents recent accounting standards in may of  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu  which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  this guidance amends certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june of  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu was issued to improve the comparability of financial reporting between us gaap and international financial reporting standards  and eliminates previous us gaap guidance that allowed an entity to present components of other comprehensive income oci as part of its statement of changes in shareholders equity 
with the issuance of asu  companies are now required to report all components of oci either in a single continuous statement of total comprehensive income  which includes components of both oci and net income  or in a separate statement appearing consecutively with the statement of income 
asu does not affect current guidance for the accounting of the components of oci  or which items are included within total comprehensive income 
asu also states that reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income are presented separately on the face of the financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu  which requires companies to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of aoci by component 
in addition  companies are required to report significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  companies are required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail on those amounts 
asu is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu affected presentation only and therefore did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the adoption of asu is not expected to impact our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in september of  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu 
the new guidance provides entities with the option to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would not be required to perform the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test 
entities also have the option to bypass the assessment of qualitative factors for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test  as was required prior to the issuance of this new guidance 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market rate exposure in our financial instruments due to changes in interest rates and prices 
variable and fixed rate debt our revolving credit agreement bears interest at daily libor plus to based upon the then current availability under the facility 
at february   there were no outstanding borrowings under the agreement 
additionally  we have a senior secured term loan facility due october with a balance of million at february   that bears interest at libor subject to a floor of  plus 
excluding our interest rate swap  a one percent change in the libor rate would have affected net earnings by approximately million for fiscal the risks related to changes in the libor rate are substantially mitigated by our interest rate swap 
the fair value of our senior subordinated notes due october was million at february  we determine fair value on our fixed rate debt by using quoted market prices and current interest rates 
interest rate swaps on october   we settled our interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge on million of our term loan prior to its amendment and restatement 
the swap was used to minimize interest rate exposure and overall interest costs by converting the variable component of the total interest rate to a fixed rate of 
since february   this swap was deemed to be fully effective and all adjustments in the interest rate swap fair value have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the settlement of this swap resulted in an interest charge of million  which was previously recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss 
on october   we entered into two new interest rate swaps for a notional amount of million each that together are designated as a cash flow hedge on the first million of the amended and restated term loan 
the interest rate swaps convert the variable libor portion of the interest payments  subject to a floor of  due on the first million of the term loan to a fixed rate of 
as of february   the fair value of the new interest rate swaps was a net million payable 
as of january   the fair value of the previous swap  terminated in october  was million payable 
the swap value is recorded within other long term liabilities on the balance sheet
