we have also operated rigs in myanmar  a country that is subject to some us trading sanctions 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations  including those relating to sanctions and export restrictions  may subject us to criminal sanctions or civil remedies  including fines  denial of export privileges  injunctions or seizures of assets 
investors could view any potential violations of ofac regulations negatively  which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares 
governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions  the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries  including local content requirements for participating in tenders for certain drilling contracts 
many governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction or require use of a local agent 
in addition  government action  including initiatives by opec  may continue to cause oil or gas price volatility 
in some areas of the world  this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work by major oil companies and may continue to do so 
a substantial portion of our drilling contracts are partially payable in local currency 
those amounts may exceed our local currency needs  leading to the accumulation of excess local currency  which  in certain instances  may be subject to either temporary blocking or other difficulties converting to us dollars  our functional currency  or to other currencies in which we operate 
excess amounts of local currency may be exposed to the risk of currency exchange losses 
the shipment of goods  services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations 
our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate 
moreover  many countries  including the us  control the import and export of certain goods  services and technology and impose related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations 
governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries  persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries  persons and entities  and we are also subject to the us anti boycott law 
the laws and regulations concerning import and export activity  recordkeeping and reporting  import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing 
these laws and regulations may be enacted  amended  enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations 
ongoing economic challenges may increase some foreign governments efforts to enact  enforce  amend or interpret laws and regulations as a method to increase revenue 
shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons  some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes 
shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime 
an inability to obtain visas and work permits for our employees on a timely basis could hurt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 
our ability to operate worldwide depends on our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel to travel in and out of  and to work in  the jurisdictions in which we operate 
governmental actions in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate may make it difficult for us to move our personnel in and out of these jurisdictions by delaying or withholding the approval of these permits 
for example  in the past few years  we have experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining the necessary visas and work permits for our employees to work in angola  where we operate a number of rigs 
if we are not able to obtain visas and work permits for the employees we need to operate our rigs on a timely basis  we might not be able to perform our obligations under our drilling contracts  which could allow our customers to cancel the contracts 
if our customers cancel some of our contracts  and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms  it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our business involves numerous operating hazards 
our operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells  such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  punch throughs  craterings  fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes and tropical storms 
we may also be subject to property  environmental and other damage claims by oil and gas companies 
our insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover losses  and we do not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks 
there are also risks following the loss of control of a well  such as a blowout or cratering  including the cost to regain control of or redrill the well and associated pollution 
damage to the environment could also result from our operations  particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires 
the south china sea  the northwest coast of australia and the us gulf of mexico area are subject to typhoons  hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis  and our drilling rigs in these regions may be exposed to damage or total loss by these storms  some of which may not be covered by insurance 
the occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations  damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury to or death of rig personnel 
some experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of these extreme weather conditions 
we are also subject to personal injury and other claims by rig personnel as a result of our drilling operations 
operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns  abnormal drilling conditions  failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services  or personnel shortages 
in addition  offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
we have two main types of insurance coverage hull and machinery coverage for property damage and excess liability coverage  which generally covers offshore risks  such as personal injury  third party property claims  and third party non crew claims  including wreck removal and pollution 
we generally have no coverage for hull and machinery exposure for named storms in the us gulf of mexico 
we also generally self insure coverage for adti exposures related to well control and redrill liability for well blowouts 
however  in the event of a total loss of such a drilling unit there is no deductible 
we also maintain per occurrence deductibles on such rigs that generally range up to million for various third party liabilities and an additional aggregate annual self insured retention of million 
with respect to the remaining million excess liability coverage  we generally retain the risk for any liability in excess of this coverage  however  our wholly owned captive insurance company has underwritten the million self insured retention noted above 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer or  with respect to the standard jackups we operate under operating agreements with shelf drilling for a transitional period  shelf drilling  it could adversely affect our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the amount of our insurance may be less than the related impact on enterprise value after a loss 
our insurance coverage will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations 
our coverage includes annual aggregate policy limits 
as a result  we generally retain the risk for any losses in excess of these limits 
we generally do not carry insurance for loss of revenue unless contractually required  and certain other claims may also not be reimbursed by insurance carriers 
any such lack of reimbursement may cause us to incur substantial costs 
moreover  no assurance can be made that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks 
failure to recruit and retain key personnel could hurt our operations 
we depend on the continuing efforts of key members of our management  as well as other highly skilled personnel  to operate and provide technical services and support for our business worldwide 
historically  competition for the personnel required for drilling operations  including for turnkey drilling and drilling management services businesses and construction projects  has intensified as the number of rigs activated  added to worldwide fleets or under construction increased  leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry and creating upward pressure on wages and higher turnover 
we may experience a reduction in the experience level of our personnel as a result of any increased turnover  which could lead to higher downtime and more operating incidents  which in turn could decrease revenues and increase costs 
if increased competition for qualified personnel were to intensify in the future we may experience increases in costs or limits on operations 
our labor costs and the operating restrictions under which we operate could increase as a result of collective bargaining negotiations and changes in labor laws and regulations 
some of our employees working in angola  the uk  nigeria  norway  australia and brazil  are represented by  and some of our contracted labor work under  collective bargaining agreements 
many of these represented individuals are working under agreements that are subject to annual salary negotiation 
these negotiations could result in higher personnel expenses  other increased costs or increased operational restrictions as the outcome of such negotiations apply to all offshore employees not just the union members 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the us  as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed 
additional unionization efforts  if successful  new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions 
worldwide financial and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  profitability and financial position 
worldwide financial and economic conditions could cause our ability to access the capital markets to be severely restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access such markets  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
worldwide economic conditions have in the past impacted  and could in the future impact  the lenders participating in our credit facilities and our customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
a slowdown in economic activity could reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in an extended period of lower oil and natural gas prices 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices  could reduce demand for our drilling services and have a material adverse effect on our revenue  profitability and financial position 
failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act could result in fines  criminal penalties  drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions  including the uk bribery act  which became effective on july   generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations or violations under the bribery act  either due to our own acts or our omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others  including our partners in our various joint ventures  we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
civil penalties under the anti bribery provisions of the fcpa could range up to  per violation  with a criminal fine up to the greater of million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain to us or twice the gross pecuniary loss to others  if larger 
civil penalties under the accounting provisions of the fcpa can range up to  per violation and a company that knowingly commits a violation can be fined up to million per violation 
in addition  both the sec and the doj could assert that conduct extending over a period of time may constitute multiple violations for purposes of assessing the penalty amounts 
often  dispositions for these types of matters result in modifications to business practices and compliance programs and possibly the appointment of a monitor to review future business and practices with the goal of ensuring compliance with the fcpa 
on november   we reached a settlement with the sec and the doj with respect to certain charges relating to the anti bribery and books and records provisions of the fcpa 
in november  under the terms of the settlements  we paid a total of approximately million in penalties  interest and disgorgement of profits 
we have also consented to the entry of a civil injunction in two sec actions and have entered into a three year deferred prosecution agreement with the doj the dpa 
in connection with the dpa  we have agreed to implement and maintain certain internal controls  policies and procedures 
for the duration of the dpa  we are also obligated to provide an annual written report to the doj of our efforts and progress in maintaining and enhancing our compliance policies and procedures 
in the event the doj determines that we have knowingly violated the terms of the dpa  the doj may impose an extension of the term of the agreement or  if the doj determines we have breached the dpa  the doj may pursue criminal charges or a civil or administrative action against us 
the doj may also find  in its sole discretion  that a change in circumstances has eliminated the need for the corporate compliance reporting obligations of the dpa and may terminate the dpa prior to the three year term 
failure to comply with the terms of the dpa may impact our operations and any resulting fines may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
we could also face fines  sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions  including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets 
our customers in those jurisdictions could seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interests 
we could also face other third party claims by agents  shareholders  debt holders  or other interest holders or constituents of our company 
in addition  disclosure of the subject matter of the investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current customers and potential customers  to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets

regulation of greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business 
some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases ghgs and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
in response to such studies  the issue of climate change and the effect of ghg emissions  in particular emissions from fossil fuels  is attracting increasing attention worldwide 
legislation to regulate emissions of ghgs has been introduced in the us congress  and there has been a wide ranging policy debate  both in the us and internationally  regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation 
some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions 
those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement 
in addition  efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues  such as the united nations climate change conference in doha in also  the us environmental protection agency epa has undertaken efforts to collect information regarding ghg emissions and their effects 
following a finding by the epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health  the epa finalized motor vehicle ghg standards  the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil  and a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air act s prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect on january  facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit  metric tons or more of co equivalent per year are now required to report annual ghg emissions to the epa 
because our business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry  existing or future laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements related to ghgs and climate change  including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources  could have a negative impact on our business if such laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas or limit drilling opportunities 
in addition  such laws  regulations  treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  which may have a negative impact on our business 
we are subject to litigation that  if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition to the litigation surrounding the macondo well incident and the frade field incident  we are subject to a variety of other litigation 
certain of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos or toxic fumes or resulting from other occupational diseases  such as silicosis  and various other medical issues that can remain undiscovered for a considerable amount of time 
some of these subsidiaries that have been put on notice of potential liabilities have no assets 
further  our patent for dual activity technology has been challenged  and we have been accused of infringing other patents 
other subsidiaries are subject to litigation relating to environmental damage 
we cannot predict the outcome of the cases involving those subsidiaries or the potential costs to resolve them 
insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases  insurers may not remain solvent  and policies may not be located  and liabilities associated with the macondo well incident may exhaust some or all of the insurance available to cover certain claims 
suits against non asset owning subsidiaries have and may in the future give rise to alter ego or successor in interest claims against us and our asset owning subsidiaries to the extent a subsidiary is unable to pay a claim or insurance is not available or sufficient to cover the claims 
we are also subject to a number of significant tax disputes  including a trial on criminal and civil charges that commenced in norway in late to the extent that one or more pending or future litigation matters is not resolved in our favor and is not covered by insurance  a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition could result 
public health threats could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial results 
public health threats  such as the hn flu virus  severe acute respiratory syndrome  and other highly communicable diseases  outbreaks of which have already occurred in various parts of the world in which we operate  could adversely impact our operations  the operations of our customers and the global economy  including the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas and the level of demand for our services 
any quarantine of personnel or inability to access our offices or rigs could adversely affect our operations 
travel restrictions or operational problems in any part of the world in which we operate  or any reduction in the demand for drilling services caused by public health threats in the future  may materially impact operations and adversely affect our financial results 
acts of terrorism  piracy and social unrest could affect the markets for drilling services 
acts of terrorism and social unrest  brought about by world political events or otherwise  have caused instability in the world s financial and insurance markets in the past and may occur in the future 
such acts could be directed against companies such as ours 
in addition  acts of terrorism  piracy and social unrest could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for drilling services 
insurance premiums could increase and coverages may be unavailable in the future 
us government regulations may effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries 
these regulations could be amended to cover countries where we currently operate or where we may wish to operate in the future 
our contracts do not generally provide indemnification against loss of capital assets or loss revenues resulting from acts of terrorism  piracy or social unrest 
we have limited insurance coverage for physical damage losses resulting from risks  such as terrorist acts  piracy  civil unrest  expropriation and acts of war  for our assets  but we do not carry insurance for loss of revenues resulting from such risks 
other risks a change in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we have operations  are incorporated or are resident could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings  which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations 
we operate worldwide through our various subsidiaries 
consequently  we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws  treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate  which could include laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates 
a material change in the tax laws or policies  or their interpretation  of any country in which we have significant operations  or in which we are incorporated or resident  could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could be significant to our financial results 
tax legislative proposals intending to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies that have legal domiciles outside the us  but have certain us connections  have repeatedly been introduced in the us congress 
recent examples include  but are not limited to  legislative proposals that would broaden the circumstances in which a non us company would be considered a non us resident  including the use of management and control provisions to determine corporate residency  and proposals that could override certain tax treaties and limit treaty benefits on certain payments by us subsidiaries to non us affiliates 
additionally  in november and again in february  the us congress introduced a proposal which would disallow any deduction for otherwise tax deductible payments relating to any incident resulting in the discharge of oil into navigable waters  such as the macondo well incident 
any material change in tax laws or policies  or their interpretation  resulting from such legislative proposals or inquiries could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could have a material adverse effect on our statement of financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our operating structure  intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries could result in a higher tax rate on our worldwide earnings  which could result in a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations 
we are a swiss corporation that operates through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world 
consequently  we are subject to tax laws  treaties and regulations in and between the countries in which we operate 
our income taxes are based upon the applicable tax laws and tax rates in effect in the countries in which we operate and earn income as well as upon our operating structures in these countries 
our income tax returns are subject to review and examination 
we do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority 
if any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure  intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries  or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure  or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country  particularly in the us  norway or brazil  our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely affected 
for example  there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the us or maintaining a permanent establishment under an applicable treaty  so we cannot be certain that the us internal revenue service irs will not contend successfully that we or any of our key subsidiaries were or are engaged in a trade or business in the us or  when applicable  maintained or maintains a permanent establishment in the us if we or any of our key subsidiaries were considered to have been engaged in a trade or business in the us when applicable  through a permanent establishment  we could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of our earnings effectively connected to such us business during the period in which this was considered to have occurred  in which case our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings for that period could increase substantially  and our earnings and cash flows from operations for that period could be adversely affected 
the norwegian authorities have issued criminal indictments against two of our subsidiaries alleging misleading or incomplete disclosures in norwegian tax returns for the years of through  as well as civil actions based upon inaccuracies in norwegian statutory financial statements for the periods of through this trial is currently ongoing 
we cannot be certain that the norwegian authorities will not be successful in proving their allegations in a norwegian court of law 
an unfavorable outcome on the norwegian civil or criminal tax matters could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
us tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company  which could have adverse us federal income tax consequences to us holders 
a foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes if either at least percent of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income or at least percent of the average value of the corporation assets produce or are held for the production of those types of passive income 
for purposes of these tests  passive income includes dividends  interest and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and certain rents and royalties  but does not include income derived from the performance of services 
we believe that we have not been and will not be a pfic with respect to any taxable year 
our income from offshore contract drilling services should be treated as services income for purposes of determining whether we are a pfic 
accordingly  we believe that our income from our offshore contract drilling services should not constitute passive income  and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income should not constitute passive assets 
there is significant legal authority supporting this position  including statutory provisions  legislative history  case law and irs pronouncements concerning the characterization  for other tax purposes  of income derived from services where a substantial component of such income is attributable to the value of the property or equipment used in connection with providing such services 
it should be noted  however  that a recent case and an irs pronouncement which relies on the recent case characterize income from time chartering of vessels as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes 
however  the irs subsequently has formally announced that it does not agree with the decision in that case 
moreover  we believe that the terms of the time charters in the recent case differ in material respects from the terms of our drilling contracts with customers 
no assurance can be given that the irs or a court will accept our position  and there is a risk that the irs or a court could determine that we are a pfic 
if we were to be treated as a pfic for any taxable year  our us shareholders would face adverse us tax consequences 
under the pfic rules  unless a shareholder makes certain elections available under the internal revenue code of  as amended which elections could themselves have adverse consequences for such shareholder  such shareholder would be liable to pay us federal income tax at the highest applicable income tax rates on ordinary income upon the receipt of excess distributions as defined for us tax purposes and upon any gain from the disposition of our shares  plus interest on such amounts  as if such excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder s holding period of our shares 
in addition  under applicable statutory provisions  the preferential percent tax rate on qualified dividend income  which applies to dividends paid to non corporate shareholders prior to  does not apply to dividends paid by a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation is a pfic for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year 
we have significant carrying amounts of goodwill and long lived assets that are subject to impairment testing 
at december   the carrying amount of our property and equipment was billion  representing percent of our total assets  and the carrying amount of our goodwill was billion  representing nine percent of our total assets 
in accordance with our critical accounting policies  we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of our assets held and used may not be recoverable  and we conduct impairment testing for our goodwill when events and circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit may have fallen below its carrying amount 
in the year ended december   in connection with the sale of drilling units to shelf drilling  we recognized losses of million and million on the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  respectively  attributable to the transactions 
as a result of our goodwill impairment test  performed as of october   we recognized aggregate losses of billion on the impairment of goodwill associated with our contract drilling services reporting unit due to a decline in projected cash flows and market valuations for this reporting unit 
future expectations of low dayrates or rig utilization rates could result in the recognition of additional losses on impairment of our long lived asset groups  particularly with respect to our high specification jackups  or our goodwill if future cash flow expectations  based upon information available to management at the time of measurement  indicate that the carrying amount of our asset groups or goodwill may be impaired 
we have significant exposure to losses resulting from our contractual relationships with shelf drilling and its affiliates 
in connection with our sale transactions with shelf drilling  we have agreed to indemnify shelf from certain liabilities  and shelf drilling has agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities and make certain payments to us 
however  the indemnity from shelf drilling may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of liabilities to third parties  and shelf drilling may not be willing or able to satisfy its indemnification or payment obligations in the future 
pursuant to the agreements we entered into with shelf drilling  including purchase agreements  operating agreements with respect to rigs that we continue to operate on behalf of shelf drilling and a transition services agreement  we have agreed to indemnify shelf drilling from certain liabilities  and shelf drilling has agreed to indemnify us from certain liabilities including  without limitation  liabilities related to operational risks with respect to shelf drilling rigs  liabilities related to credit support we are providing to shelf drilling and certain liabilities related to employees and make certain payments to us 
however  third parties could seek to hold us responsible for the liabilities with respect to which shelf drilling has agreed to indemnify us 
in addition  the indemnity may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities  and shelf drilling may not be willing or able to satisfy its indemnification or payment obligations to us 
moreover  even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from shelf drilling any amounts for which we are held liable  we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 
each of these risks could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be limited in our use of net operating losses 
our ability to benefit from our deferred tax assets depends on us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
we have established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit for a number of our non us net operating loss carryforwards  and we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our non us or non us deferred tax assets if market conditions change materially and  as a result  our future earnings are  or are projected to be  significantly less than we currently estimate 
our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the tax authorities of the jurisdictions where the net operating losses are incurred 
our status as a swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding tax 
swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without additional shareholder approval  but this authorization is limited to percent of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years 
at the annual general meeting on may   our shareholders approved our current authorized share capital  which expires on may  and was limited to percent of our existing share capital 
in connection with our december and may issuance of new shares  our available authorized share capital decreased to percent of our existing stated share capital 
additionally  subject to specified exceptions  swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares 
swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions 
in the event we need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares  currently chf  equivalent to based on a foreign exchange rate of chf to usd on february   we will need to obtain approval of shareholders to decrease the par value of our shares or issue another class of shares with a lower par value 
any reduction in par value would decrease our par value available for future repayment of share capital not subject to swiss withholding tax 
swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions 
for example  dividends must be approved by shareholders 
these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility  and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 
distributions to shareholders in the form of a par value reduction and dividend distributions out of qualifying additional paid in capital are not currently subject to the percent swiss federal withholding tax 
dividend distributions out of qualifying additional paid in capital do not require registration with the commercial register of the canton of zug 
however  the swiss withholding tax rules could also be changed in the future 
due to the continuing debate in the swiss political arena  we cannot provide assurance that the current swiss law with respect to distributions out of additional paid in capital will not be changed or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders  in particular as a result of distributions out of additional paid in capital becoming subject to swiss federal withholding tax or subject to additional corporate law restrictions 
in addition  over the long term  the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions or the amount of qualifying additional paid in capital available for us to pay out as distributions is limited 
if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value  or out of qualifying additional paid in capital as shown on transocean ltd 
s standalone swiss statutory financial statements  we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 
under present swiss tax law  repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to a percent swiss withholding tax on the repurchase price less the par value  and since january   to the extent attributable to qualifying additional paid in capital  if any 
at our annual general meeting  our shareholders approved the repurchase of up to chf billion of our shares for cancellation the share repurchase program 
on february   our board of directors authorized our management to implement the share repurchase program 
we may repurchase shares under the share repurchase program via a second trading line on the six from institutional investors who are generally able to receive a full refund of the swiss withholding tax 
alternatively  in relation to the us market  we may repurchase shares under the share repurchase program using an alternative procedure pursuant to which we can repurchase shares under the share repurchase program via a virtual second trading line from market players in particular  banks and institutional investors who are generally entitled to receive a full refund of the swiss withholding tax 
there may not be sufficient liquidity in our shares on the six to repurchase the amount of shares that we would like to repurchase using the second trading line on the six 
in addition  our ability to use the virtual second trading line is limited to the share repurchase program currently approved by our shareholders  and any use of the virtual second trading line with respect to future share repurchase programs will require the approval of the competent swiss tax and other authorities 
we may not be able to repurchase as many shares as we would like to repurchase for purposes of capital reduction on either the virtual second trading line or  in the future  a six second trading line without subjecting the selling shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions
