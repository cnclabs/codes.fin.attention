item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information set forth below should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  and other financial information included herein 
overview ariad is a global oncology company whose vision is to transform the lives of cancer patients with breakthrough medicines 
our mission is to discover  develop and commercialize small molecule drugs to treat cancer in patients with the greatest and most urgent unmet medical need aggressive cancers where current therapies are inadequate 
we are focused on commercializing our first approved cancer medicine  iclusig ponatinib  and developing additional molecularly targeted therapies to treat patients with blood cancers and solid tumors 
iclusig and our product candidates  ap and ridaforolimus  were discovered internally by our scientists based on our expertise in computational and structure based drug design 
ridaforolimus is being developed by merck co  inc  or merck  pursuant to a license agreement we entered into with merck in iclusig ponatinib on december   we obtained accelerated approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  to sell our first new cancer medicine  iclusig 
iclusig is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor  or tki  that is approved in the united states for the treatment of adult patients with chronic  accelerated or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia  or cml  who are resistant or intolerant to prior tki therapy  and the treatment of adult patients with philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia  or ph all  who are resistant or intolerant to prior tki therapy 
we have commenced sales and marketing of iclusig  and the medicine is now available for patients in the united states through specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors 
we currently charge approximately  on a wholesale basis  for an annual supply of the recommended dose of iclusig 
we have also filed for marketing authorization for iclusig with the european medicines authority  or ema  and we currently anticipate approval in the third quarter of we will need to obtain pricing and reimbursement approval in certain countries in europe before it will be widely available for use  which approvals we anticipate obtaining beginning in we also plan to file for marketing authorization for iclusig with regulatory authorities in other selected territories around the world  including switzerland  canada and australia in the second half of and japan in mid each of these regulatory authorities has its own processes and timelines for the review and approval of marketing authorization applications 
we plan to commercialize iclusig on our own in the united states and  subject to obtaining regulatory approval  in europe and other selected territories worldwide 
during the past year  we have been actively focused on preparing for the commercial launch of iclusig in the united states  including establishing an experienced and trained sales force and other professional staff necessary for an effective launch  implementing systems and processes to support launch  developing tools and materials to be utilized during the commercialization of iclusig and other activities  and arranging for iclusig to be provided to patients through a network of specialty pharmacies and specialty distributors 
we have also initiated operations in europe  with headquarters in switzerland  in preparation for potential ema approval of iclusig 
we have hired management and other key personnel in switzerland who are building our business infrastructure and capabilities in europe 

table of contents we are also developing iclusig for expanded indications in cml and in additional cancer indications 
in july  we initiated a randomized phase clinical trial of ponatinib  referred to as the epic evaluation of ponatinib versus imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia trial  in adult patients with newly diagnosed cml in the chronic phase 
we currently anticipate completion of enrollment by the end of  with an interim analysis of the data in mid in august  we initiated a multicenter phase clinical trial in japan of iclusig in japanese patients with cml who have failed treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib or who have ph all and have failed prior treatment with tkis 
this trial is designed to establish the recommended dose for iclusig and confirm its anti leukemic activity in japanese patients 
in january  we announced an agreement with newcastle university  uk  on behalf of the uk national cancer research institute  or ncri  to collaborate on a multi center  randomized phase trial  named spirit  to assess the impact of switching patients with cml being treated with a first line tki  upon suboptimal response or treatment failure  to iclusig 
we expect that a total of approximately  patients will be enrolled in this trial  with enrollments beginning in the second quarter of we believe that iclusig has potential applications beyond cml in other blood cancers and solid tumors  such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors  or gist  acute myeloid leukemia and certain forms of non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we plan to initiate additional clinical trials of iclusig as we continue development of this product candidate 
ap ap is an investigational inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase  or alk  epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr  and repressor of silencing  or ros  which are clinically validated targets in nsclc 
we initiated patient enrollment in a phase clinical trial of ap in the third quarter of the protocol is designed to enroll approximately to patients in the phase portion of the trial and approximately patients in the phase portion of the trial 
we expect to commence the phase portion of the trial in the first half of and  subject to further discussions with the regulatory agencies  commence a pivotal trial of ap in alk positive nsclc patients in mid in parallel with the four cohorts of the phase portion of the trial 
ridaforolimus ridaforolimus is an investigational inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin  or mtor  that we discovered and developed internally and later licensed in to merck 
under the license agreement  merck has assumed responsibility for all activities related to the development  manufacture and commercialization of ridaforolimus and funds percent of all ridaforolimus costs incurred after january  the agreement provides that merck will develop ridaforolimus in multiple oncology indications 
we received an up front payment of million in and a million milestone payment in potential additional milestone payments to us include up to million associated with potential regulatory filings and approvals for additional cancer indications and up to million associated with the achievement of certain sales thresholds  although there can be no assurance that any future payments will be received under the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial position and results of operations are affected by subjective and complex judgments  particularly in the areas of revenue recognition  the carrying value of intangible assets  accrued product development expenses  the fair value of warrants to purchase our common stock  and inventory valuation 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents license and collaboration revenue we have historically generated revenue from license and collaboration agreements with third parties related to use of our technology and or development and commercialization of product candidates 
such agreements may provide for payment to us of up front payments  periodic license payments  milestone payments and royalties 
we also generated revenue from services provided under license agreements 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and is based on the selling price of the deliverables 
when deliverables are separable  consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price of the elements and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit 
the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate units of accounting and the points in time that  or periods over which  revenue should be recognized 
regarding our collaboration agreement with merck for the development  manufacture and commercialization of ridaforolimus  in effect from july to may  we determined the license and development deliverables constituted one unit of accounting and  therefore  the up front and milestone payments were deferred and recognized over the performance period 
regarding our license agreement with merck entered into in may that replaced the collaboration agreement  we determined that the license and the services were separate units of accounting  and because the fair value of the undelivered services was known  the amounts received related to the license and the services are recognized in the period in which they are received or the services are rendered 
milestone payments under the license agreement are recognized when earned 
in the year ended december   the company recognized million under this arrangement  which reflected the receipt of a million up front payment and a million payment for our share of ridaforolimus costs incurred from january  to may  from merck pursuant to the terms of the license agreement 
license and collaboration revenue in also included million representing the recognition in of revenue deferred as of december   which was recognized upon execution of the license agreement 
in the year ended december   the company received and recorded as revenue a million milestone payment 
no milestone payments were received under the agreement in the year end december  net product revenues product sales of iclusig are recorded net of estimated government mandated rebates and chargebacks  distribution fees  copay assistance programs  product returns and other deductions 
we reflect these estimated adjustments as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the specialty pharmacy or specialty distributor  or as an accrued liability depending on the nature of the sales deduction 
we began shipping iclusig in january  and therefore we recognized no product revenues from the sale of iclusig in the united states in the year ended december  although iclusig has not been approved for commercial sale in the european union by the ema  patients are being treated with iclusig both in the framework of our clinical trials and related studies and in named patient programs 
the french regulatory authority had granted an autorisation temporaire d utilisation atu  or temporary authorization for use  for iclusig for the treatment of cml and ph all under a nominative program on a patient by patient basis 
the company began shipping product under this program during the year ended december  until all revenue recognition criteria are met  all amounts received by or due to the company under this program approximately million as of december  have not been recorded as revenue 
intangible assets at december   we reported  of intangible assets  consisting of capitalized costs related primarily to purchased and issued patents and patent applications  net of accumulated amortization 
the 
table of contents carrying value of these intangible assets is evaluated for possible impairment  and losses are recorded when the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable 
this evaluation involves estimates of future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
such estimates require judgment regarding future events and expected cash flows 
changes in these estimates  including decisions to discontinue using the technologies  could result in material changes to our balance sheet and charges to our consolidated statements of operations 
if we were to abandon the ongoing development of the underlying product candidates or technologies or terminate our efforts to pursue collaborations or license agreements  or if our estimates of future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset change  we may be required to write down or write off a portion of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
in  we recorded charges to operating expenses of million in our consolidated statements of operations to reflect impairment of the intangible assets associated with ridaforolimus  our investigational oral mtor inhibitor being developed by merck for oncology indications pursuant to a license with the company  following the decision in june by the fda not to approve the nda filed by merck for ridaforolimus for the treatment of patients with soft tissue or bone sarcomas  stating that additional clinical trial s would need to be conducted to further assess safety and efficacy of ridaforolimus in this indication 
in  we recorded charges of million in our consolidated statements of operations related to the discontinuation of efforts to pursue our nf kb technology and to the assessment of the recoverability of our argent technology and certain other technologies 
accrued product development expenses we accrue expenses for our product development activities based on our estimates of services performed or progress achieved pursuant to contracts and agreements with multiple vendors including research laboratories  contract manufacturers  contract research organizations and clinical sites 
these estimates are recorded in research and development expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and are reflected in accrued product development expenses on our balance sheet 
at december   we reported accrued product development expenses of million on our balance sheet 
our estimates of services performed or progress achieved are based on all available information we have from reports  correspondence and discussions with our vendors 
our estimates of accrued expenses based on such information require judgment 
actual costs may vary from such estimates 
when such variances become known  we adjust our expenses accordingly 
fair value of warrants warrants outstanding at december  to purchase  shares of our common stock  issued on february  in connection with a registered direct offering of our common stock  were classified as a derivative liability 
accordingly  the fair value of the warrants was recorded on our balance sheet as a liability  and such fair value was adjusted in each financial reporting period with the adjustment to fair value reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we reported a warrant liability of million on our balance sheet 
during the three month period ended march   all  warrants that were outstanding at december  were exercised for proceeds to us of approximately million 
upon the exercise of these remaining warrants  the balance of the warrant liability and the proceeds received upon exercise were credited to stockholders equity and the liability was eliminated 
the fair value of the warrants was determined using the black scholes option valuation model 
fluctuations in the assumptions and factors used in the black scholes model resulted in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants recorded on our balance sheet reflected through charges or credits in our consolidated statements of operations 
the primary factor in the black scholes model that impacted the fair value of the warrants was the market value of our common stock on the date of the valuation 

table of contents inventory inventory costs include the costs related to the manufacturing of iclusig  including costs of contract manufacturing  quality control costs and shipping costs from the manufacturers to the final distribution warehouse 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine the cost of our inventories on a first in  first out basis 
if we identify excess  obsolete or unsalable items  inventories are written down to their realizable value in the period in which the impairment is identified 
estimates of excess inventory consider our projected sales of the product and the remaining shelf lives of the product 
prior to receiving approval from the fda in december to sell iclusig  we expensed all costs incurred related to the manufacture of iclusig as research and development costs because of the inherent risks associated with the development of a drug candidate  the uncertainty about the regulatory approval process and the lack of history for our company of regulatory approval of drug candidates 
much of the product produced prior to fda approval is expected to be available for commercial or clinical use 
accordingly  we expect the manufacturing costs for iclusig included in our future cost of sales to initially be insignificant  as most of these costs will have been recorded as research and development expenses in prior periods  and to increase as we begin to sell inventory that is produced after we began capitalizing iclusig commercial inventory 
we expect this lower cost to occur during the first six to twelve months of commercial sales of iclusig  however  the time period over which this reduced cost inventory is consumed will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of future sales  the ultimate use of this inventory in either commercial sales  clinical development or other research activities and the ability to utilize inventory prior to its expiration date 
we expect that as this reduced cost inventory is used  the cost of product sales  before consideration of any required inventory reserves  will be in the single digits as a percentage of net revenues 
in addition  we may need to establish reserves for inventory in excess of our projected sales within the product s expiration period  which may impact the cost of product sales as a percentage of net revenues 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue we recorded total revenue of  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  total revenue in consisted primarily of license revenue pursuant to a license agreement related to our argent technology 
total revenue in consisted primarily of a million milestone payment received pursuant to our license agreement with merck for the acceptance of an application for regulatory approval in europe of ridaforolimus for the treatment of patients with sarcoma  which was subsequently withdrawn by merck in november we expect that our revenue in will increase substantially due primarily to anticipated product sales of iclusig in the us and to a much lesser degree due to an increase in license revenue pursuant to license agreements related to our argent technology 
product sales of iclusig in are dependent in part on the success of our commercialization efforts in the united states and on the status of regulatory approval for iclusig in europe  which we currently anticipate in the third quarter of if applicable regulatory criteria are not met  the ema could refuse to approve our application or delay the approval of iclusig 
in addition  we will need to obtain pricing and reimbursement approval in certain countries in europe before it will be widely available for use 
we currently anticipate receiving pricing and reimbursement approvals in europe commencing in there can be no assurance that we will be successful in commercializing iclusig in the united states or that iclusig will receive marketing authorization approval in the european union 

table of contents operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in the research and development process necessary to develop a pharmaceutical product for commercialization is subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
this process typically takes years to complete and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
current requirements include preclinical toxicology  pharmacology and metabolism studies  as well as in vivo efficacy studies in relevant animal models of disease  manufacturing of drug product for preclinical studies and clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supply  submission of the results of preclinical studies and information regarding manufacturing and control and proposed clinical protocol to the us food and drug administration  or fda  in an investigational new drug application  or ind or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states  conduct of clinical trials designed to provide data and information regarding the safety and efficacy of the product candidate in humans  and submission of all the results of testing to the fda in a new drug application  or nda or similar filings with regulatory agencies outside the united states 
upon approval by the appropriate regulatory authorities  including in some countries approval of product pricing  we may commence commercial marketing and distribution of the product 
we group our research and development  or r d  expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture product candidates  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by product candidate 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to lease  operate and maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
direct external expenses are further categorized as costs for clinical programs and costs for preclinical programs 
preclinical programs include product candidates undergoing toxicology  pharmacology  metabolism and efficacy studies and manufacturing process development required before testing in humans can begin 
product candidates are designated as clinical programs once we have filed an ind with the fda  or a similar filing with regulatory agencies outside the united states  for the purpose of commencing clinical trials in humans 

table of contents our r d expenses for as compared to were as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands direct external expenses clinical programs preclinical programs all other r d expenses in and  our clinical programs consisted of i iclusig ponatinib  our pan bcr abl inhibitor  and ii ap  our alk  egfr and ros inhibitor for which we filed an ind in june and commenced a phase clinical trial in the third quarter of direct external expenses for iclusig were million in  an increase of million  or percent  compared to expenses of million 
the increase is due to an increase in clinical trial costs of million  contract manufacturing costs of million and supporting non clinical costs of million 
clinical trial costs increased primarily due to ongoing treatment of patients in our pivotal phase pace clinical trial and increased enrollment and treatment of patients in our phase epic clinical trial in newly diagnosed cml patients  including purchases of the comparator drug  imatinib  for use in this trial  as well as costs related to initiation of a phase clinical trial of iclusig in japan  offset in part by a decrease in costs of our on going phase clinical trial as treatment of patients and other activities in this trial have decreased over this time period 
contract manufacturing costs increased due primarily to the conduct of product and process development and qualification initiatives to support regulatory filings for iclusig  as well as the production of iclusig for use in our clinical trials and to provide for initial commercial supply in anticipation of regulatory approval of iclusig 
supporting non clinical costs increased due primarily to increased quality and stability studies and initiatives to develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic test to identify patients with the ti mutation of the bcr abl gene 
we collaborated with molecularmd corp 
to establish this companion diagnostic test and molecularmd had filed a premarketing approval pma application with the fda 
in september  we and molecularmd announced the voluntary withdrawal of the pma following advice from the fda that the fda no longer considered this test to be a companion diagnostic test for ponatinib 
we expect that our direct external expenses for iclusig will increase in as we continue to treat more patients in our ongoing clinical trials  initiate additional clinical trials and conduct additional studies to support continued development of iclusig 
direct external expenses for ap were million for  an increase of million  or percent  compared to expenses of million  of which million were included in clinical programs and million were included in preclinical programs 
the increase in expenses for ap was due to an increase in clinical trial costs of million and an increase of million in contract manufacturing cost  offset in part by a decrease in supporting non clinical costs of million 
the increase in clinical trial costs was due to costs of the phase clinical trial initiated in the third quarter of the increase in contract manufacturing costs was due to the manufacture of additional material to supply the phase clinical trial and investment in product and process development 
the decrease in supporting non clinical costs was due primarily to the completion in of toxicology studies required for filing of the ind 
we expect that our direct external expenses for ap will increase in as we continue to enroll patients in our on going clinical trial of this product candidate and conduct additional studies to support continued development and potential regulatory approval of ap all other r d expenses increased by million  or percent  to million in  as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of million related primarily to an increase in the number of employees to support expanding r d activities  overall increases in compensation for existing employees and an increase in recruiting costs  an increase in professional services of million due primarily to initiatives to upgrade systems and technology used in our business  an increase in stock based compensation expense of million as a result of the impact 
table of contents of a significant increase in the market value of our common stock on the value of stock based compensation awards in and as well as the vesting of previously awarded performance share units triggered by the approval of iclusig by the fda in december  an impairment charge related to ridaforolimus intangible assets of million  an increase in rent expense of million as a result of an amendment to our existing building lease and a new lease agreement for additional space  an increase in general expenses of million  including technology support costs and travel costs associated with our expanded r d workforce  and an increase in lab expenses of million 
we expect that all other r d expenses will increase in to support the expanding development of iclusig and ap and our ongoing discovery research efforts 
the successful commercialization of iclusig and development of our product candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that iclusig will be accepted in the marketplace  as it competes against existing therapies  or any of our product candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or could result in label warnings related to or recalls of approved products 
we  the fda or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
other risks associated with the commercialization of iclusig and our product development programs are described in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  to million in  compared to million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in personnel costs of million related primarily to an increase in the number of employees  including sales related personnel to support expanding business activities and to prepare for commercial launch of iclusig  overall increases in compensation for existing employees and an increase in recruiting costs  an increase in professional services of million as a result of an increase in corporate and commercial development initiatives to plan and prepare for the commercial launch of iclusig  an increase in stock based compensation expense of million due to the impact of a significant increase in the market value of our common stock on the value of stock based compensation awards in and as well as the vesting of previously awarded performance share units triggered by the approval of iclusig by the fda in december  an increase in general expenses of million primarily related to increased travel costs as we prepared for regulatory approval and commercial launch of iclusig  and an increase in overhead and other expenses of million primarily related to insurance costs  taxes and other miscellaneous costs 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in as we commercialize iclusig in the united states and prepare for commercial launch of iclusig in europe  including the hiring of sales  marketing and commercial operations personnel  to support the expansion of our european operations and ongoing research and development activities 
we expect that our operating expenses in total will increase substantially in for the reasons described above 
operating expenses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the actual amount of any increase in operating expenses will depend on  among other things  the status of regulatory review and timing of potential regulatory approval of iclusig in europe  the costs for commercial launch of iclusig in the united states and potential commercial launch in europe  the progress of our product development programs  including on going and planned clinical trials  results of continuing non clinical studies and the costs of product and process development activities and product manufacturing 

table of contents other income expense interest income interest income increased by percent to  in from  in  as a result of a higher average balance of funds invested in interest expense interest expense decreased by percent to  in from  in  as a result of lower average borrowings in revaluation of warrant liability in the first quarter of  all  warrants that were outstanding at december  were exercised for proceeds to us of approximately million 
during the first quarter of  the value of the warrant liability on our balance sheet was adjusted  resulting in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december   due primarily to the increase in the market price of our common stock from december  to the dates the warrants were exercised 
the revaluation of our warrant liability in resulted in a non cash charge of million 
upon exercise of those remaining warrants  the balance of the warrant liability and the associated exercise proceeds were credited to stockholders equity and the liability was eliminated 
operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in  an increase of million  or percent 
we also reported a net loss of million in  compared to a net loss of million in the corresponding period in  an increase in net loss of million or percent  and a net loss per share of for compared to for the increase in net loss is largely due to the decrease in revenue and the increase in our operating expenses described above  offset in part by the decrease in charges related to the revaluation of our warrant liability of million in  as compared to although we expect to record revenue from sales of iclusig during  we expect that we will continue to incur a net loss in due to the costs associated with the initial commercialization of iclusig in the united states and potentially in europe and the continued development of our product candidates 
years ended december  and revenue we recorded total revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  total revenue in consisted primarily of a million milestone payment received pursuant to our license agreement with merck for the acceptance of an application for regulatory approval in europe of ridaforolimus for the treatment of patients with sarcoma  which was subsequently withdrawn by merck in november total revenue in consisted of license and collaboration revenue of million and service revenue of million 
license and collaboration revenue in included the million up front payment and a million payment for our share of ridaforolimus costs incurred from january  to may  from merck pursuant to the terms of the license agreement 
license and collaboration revenue in also included million  representing the recognition in of revenue deferred as of december  under our accounting for the prior collaboration agreement with merck  which was recognized upon execution of the license agreement 
service revenue of million in the year ended december  consisted of transition services that we provided to merck pursuant to the license agreement

clinical trials costs increased primarily due to increased enrollment and treatment of patients in our pivotal phase clinical trial  offset in part by a decrease in costs of our phase clinical trial  as treatment of patients and other activities in this trial decreased over this time period 
contract manufacturing costs increased due primarily to the conduct of product and process development and qualification initiatives to support regulatory filings for this product candidate  as well as the production of ponatinib for use in our clinical trials 
supporting non clinical costs increased due primarily to increased quality and stability studies and initiatives to develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic test to identify the ti mutation of the bcr abl gene 
direct external expenses for ap were million for the year ended december   of which million were included in clinical programs and million were included in preclinical programs in the table above  reflecting the transfer of this program to a clinical development status in the third quarter of direct external expenses for ap were million for the year ended december   which were entirely included in preclinical programs 
the increase in expenses for ap was due primarily to the initiation of our phase clinical trial for this product candidate in the third quarter of as well as on going product and process development initiatives and production of ap for use in clinical trials 
we incurred no expenses for the development of ridaforolimus in the year ended december   because merck agreed to fund percent of such costs pursuant to the license agreement entered into in may direct external expenses for ridaforolimus amounted to million in  reflecting our share of the costs of global development of this product candidate with merck  including our share of merck s costs  pursuant to the cost sharing arrangement of our collaboration with merck in effect through may  all other r d expenses increased by million in compared to this increase was primarily due to a decrease of million in merck s reimbursement to us for our services pursuant to our collaboration agreement in effect until may  an increase in professional services of million due primarily to initiatives to upgrade systems and technology used in our business  an increase in stock based compensation expense of million as a result of the impact of a significant increase in the

these increases were offset in part by a decrease in other personnel costs of million due to a lower average number of employees in as compared to and a decrease in expenses related to our intellectual property  primarily due to a decrease in impairment charges of million as we reserved or wrote off the carrying value of patents related to our nf kb and argent technologies in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in professional services of million as a result of an increase in corporate and commercial development initiatives to plan and prepare for the potential commercial launch of ridaforolimus and ponatinib  an increase in stock based compensation expense of million due to the impact of a significant increase in the market value of our common stock on the value of stock based compensation awards in  a decrease of  in merck s reimbursement to us for our services pursuant to the collaboration agreement in effect until may  as well as an increase in costs to recruit personnel  travel costs and other miscellaneous costs 
other income expense interest income interest income increased by percent to  in from  in  as a result of a higher average balance of funds invested in interest expense interest expense increased by percent to  in from  in  due to higher average borrowings in revaluation of warrant liability the fair value of our warrant liability at december  was million higher than its fair value at december   due to the net impact of the exercise of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock during and the revaluation of our warrant liability at december  the revaluation of our warrant liability resulted in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  and was due primarily to the increase in the market price of our common stock from per share at december   to per share at december  the revaluation of our warrant liability in resulted in a non cash charge of million for the year ended december  operating results we reported a loss from operations of million in compared to income from operations of million in  an increase in loss of million 
this change is due primarily to the decrease in revenue as a result of the accounting impact of the license agreement entered into with merck in may and the increase in operating expenses discussed above 
we also reported a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in  an increase in net loss of million reflecting the change in loss from operations noted above plus the revaluation of the warrant liability

after adjusting for the million milestone payment from merck in  our net cash used in operating activities increased by million in  as compared to  reflecting overall increases in operating expenses and changes in working capital 
as noted above  we expect that we will incur a net loss in due to the commercialization of iclusig in the united states and potentially in europe and continued development of our product candidates  and that our investment in property and equipment will increase in to support growth of our r d and general and administrative functions 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities for financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

in january  we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a purchase price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
after giving effect to the net proceeds from this offering  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  would have been million 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   together with the net proceeds from our january stock offering  will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of on december   we obtained accelerated approval from the fda to sell iclusig in the united states  and we commenced sales in the united states in january we have filed for marketing approval of iclusig in europe and expect potential approval in the third quarter of we are selling iclusig on our own in the united states and plan to do so in europe and other selected markets worldwide  subject to obtaining regulatory approval in such territories 
during the past year  we have been preparing for commercial launch of iclusig in the united states  including the hiring and training of an experienced sales force and other professional staff necessary for an effective launch  the implementation of systems and processes to support the launch  the development of tools and materials being used in the launch and 
table of contents other activities 
in europe  we are also planning for potential marketing approval and preparing for launch of iclusig  including the hiring of personnel to build our infrastructure and capabilities in europe 
these activities will require increased spending as we launch iclusig in these markets 
there can be no assurance that iclusig will be commercially successful in the united states  where we are currently selling the product  or in other territories  where we await regulatory approval or have yet to file for regulatory approval 
if we are not successful in generating the levels of sales we expect from iclusig and or obtaining additional regulatory approvals  we may need to revise our operating plans in order to conserve cash to fund our operations 
we have historically incurred operating losses and net losses related to our research and development activities 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses and that such expenses will increase substantially in we plan to expand our development of iclusig and ap  and to conduct additional clinical trials  including the phase epic clinical trial of iclusig in newly diagnosed cml patients that we initiated in  and continue product and process development  manufacturing and other activities in support of these efforts 
we also plan to continue to invest in discovery research and add to our pipeline of product candidates through these activities 
there are many factors that will affect our level of spending on these activities  including the number  size and complexity of  and rate of enrollment of patients in  our clinical trials for iclusig and ap  the extent of other development activities for iclusig and ap  the progress of our preclinical and discovery research programs  the status of regulatory reviews and timing of potential regulatory approvals and commercial launch of iclusig in europe and other markets and of our other product candidates  the size of the workforce and required systems and infrastructure necessary to support commercialization of iclusig and our product candidates in multiple markets and other factors

in addition to milestone payments  if ridaforolimus receives regulatory approval  merck has agreed to pay us tiered double digit royalties on global net sales of ridaforolimus 
there can be no assurance that such regulatory approvals will be obtained or that we will receive any additional milestone or other payments under our license agreement with merck 
in addition to the license agreement with merck  we also have existing license agreements with two companies  medinol ltd 
and icon medical corporation  for the development and commercialization of ridaforolimus eluting stents  and other licenses of our argent technology 
if medinol  icon or the other licensees are successful in the development or commercialization of potential products or otherwise generate revenue from these licenses  we will be eligible to receive milestone payments and or royalties on sales of products 
until such time  if ever  that we generate revenues from sales of iclusig and our product candidate sufficient to fund operations  we plan to continue to fund our operations by issuing common stock  debt or other securities in one or more public or private offerings  as market conditions permit  through the incurrence of additional debt from commercial lenders or through the potential receipt of milestone payments and or royalties under our existing license agreements 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted  and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders

table of contents recently adopted or issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which requires the presentation of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  and requires retrospective application 
we adopted this asu on january   and included separate consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our available funds in accordance with our investment policy to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements first in short term  highly liquid securities  and money market accounts 
depending on our level of available funds and our expected cash requirements  we may invest a portion of our funds in marketable securities  consisting generally of corporate debt and us government and agency securities 
maturities of our marketable securities are generally limited to periods necessary to fund our liquidity needs and may not in any case exceed three years 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income 
our investments are sensitive to interest rate risk 
we believe  however  that the effect  if any  of reasonable possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows generally would not be material due to the short term nature and high credit quality of these investments 
in particular  at december   because our available funds are invested solely in securities with remaining maturities of months or less  we believe that our risk of loss due to changes in interest rates is not material 
at december   we had million outstanding under a bank term note which bears interest at prime or  alternatively  libor percent to percent 
this note is sensitive to interest rate risk 
in the event of a hypothetical percent increase in the interest rate on which the loan is based basis points at december   we would incur approximately  of additional interest expense per year based on expected balances over the next twelve months
