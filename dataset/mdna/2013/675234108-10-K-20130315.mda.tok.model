item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview oceanfirst financial corp 
has been the holding company for oceanfirst bank since it acquired the stock of the bank upon the bank s conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered capital stock savings bank in the conversion

nineteen of the offices are located in ocean county  new jersey  with four branches in monmouth county and one in middlesex county 
the bank also operates a trust and asset management office in manchester  new jersey 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on the company s interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company also generates non interest income such as income from loan sales  reverse mortgage loan originations  loan servicing  merchant check card services  deposit account services  the sale of alternative investments  trust and asset management services and other fees 
the company s operating expenses primarily consist of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  federal deposit insurance  data processing  marketing  and other general and administrative expenses 
the company s results of operations are also significantly affected by competition  general economic conditions including levels of unemployment and real estate values as well as changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory agencies 
strategy the company operates as a full service community bank  with a strong focus on consumers and businesses in its local markets 
the bank is the oldest and largest community based financial institution headquartered in ocean county  new jersey 
the bank competes with larger and out of market financial service providers through its local focus and the delivery of superior service 
the bank also competes with smaller in market financial service providers by offering a broad array of products 
the company s strategy has been to consistently grow profitability while limiting exposure to credit  interest rate and operational risks 
to accomplish these objectives  the bank has sought to grow commercial loans receivable through the offering of commercial lending services to local businesses  grow core deposits defined as all deposits other than time deposits through product offerings appealing to a broadened customer base and de novo branch expansion  and increase non interest income by expanding the menu of fee based products and services 
with industry consolidation eliminating most locally headquartered competitors  the company fills a void for locally delivered commercial loan and deposit services 
the bank assembled an experienced team of business banking professionals responsible for offering commercial loan and deposit services and merchant check card services to local businesses 
as a result of this initiative  commercial loans represented of the bank s total loans at december  as compared to at december  and only at december  commercial loan balances increased by million  or  in  with growth restrained by tepid loan demand in the weak economy 
commercial loan products entail a higher degree of credit risk than is involved in one to four family residential mortgage lending activity 
as a consequence  management continues to employ a well defined credit policy focusing on quality underwriting and close management and board monitoring 
the bank seeks to increase core deposit market share in its primary market area by expanding the branch network and improving market penetration 
over the past seventeen years through december   the bank has opened sixteen branch offices  twelve in ocean county and four in monmouth county 
the bank is continually evaluating additional office sites within its existing market area 
the bank currently plans a spring opening of a full service financial solutions center in red bank  new jersey offering deposit  lending and asset management services 
an additional branch office in jackson  new jersey is planned for mid 
table of contents core account development has benefited from bank efforts to attract business deposits in conjunction with its commercial lending operations and from an expanded mix of retail core account products 
as a result of these efforts the bank s core deposit ratio has grown to at december  as compared to at december  and only at december  core deposits are generally considered a less expensive and more stable funding source than certificates of deposit 
management continues to diversify the bank s product line in order to enhance non interest income 
the bank offers alternative investment products annuities  mutual funds and life insurance for sale through its retail branch network 
the products are non proprietary  sold through a third party vendor  and provide the bank with fee income opportunities 
the alternative investment program utilizes third party financial consultants and licensed bank employees to capture revenue associated with the sale of investment products 
the bank offers trust and asset management services and has also expanded the non interest income received from business relationships by offering fee based products  including merchant services 
as a result of these initiatives  income from fees and service charges has increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  exclusive of reverse mortgage fees and only million for the year ended december  the bank also offers reverse mortgage loans which are sold into the secondary market 
the gain on sale from selling reverse mortgages is now included in the net gain on sales of loans available for sale 
in addition to the objectives described above  the company determined to more actively manage its capital position to improve return on equity 
in the fourth quarter of  and again in the fourth quarter of  the company announced its intention to repurchase up to of its outstanding common stock 
for the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of common stock for million 
at december   there were  shares remaining to be repurchased under the existing stock repurchase plan 
summary interest earning assets  both loans and securities  are generally priced against longer term indices  while interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and borrowings  are generally priced against shorter term indices 
in late and throughout  the company s net interest margin contracted as compared to prior linked periods 
due to the low interest rate environment  high loan refinance volume has caused yields on loans and mortgage backed securities to trend downward 
at the same time  the company s asset mix has shifted as higher yielding loans have decreased due to prepayments and the sale of newly originated year fixed rate one to four family loans while lower yielding securities have increased 
based upon current economic conditions  the federal reserve has indicated that it intends to keep interest rates at current levels at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above  inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than half percentage point above the longer run goal  and longer term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored 
the federal reserve expects these thresholds to last through mid as a result  management expects the low interest rate environment to continue beyond  causing further pressure on the net interest margin 
in addition to the interest rate environment  the company s results are affected by national and local economic conditions 
recent economic indicators point to some improvement in the economy  which expanded moderately in  and in overall labor market conditions as the national unemployment rate in has improved over prior year levels 
despite these signs  the overall economy remains weak and the unemployment rate remains at elevated levels 
housing values remain significantly below their peak levels in additionally  on october  the bank s primary market area was adversely impacted by superstorm sandy which may negatively affect real estate market values and borrowers ability to repay their obligations 
these conditions have generally had an adverse impact on the company s results of operations

critical accounting policies note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of significant accounting policies 
various elements of these accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
certain assets are carried in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
policies with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses  the reserve for repurchased loans  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and judgments regarding securities impairment are the most critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the results of operations or financial condition 
these critical accounting policies and their application are reviewed periodically and  at least annually  with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio based on management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the bank s loan portfolio and the general economy 
the bank maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income 
charge offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries made on loans that have been charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when payment is received 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount management considers sufficient to provide for probable losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio resulting from management s continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and the determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loan 
the bank s allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances and a general allowance  each updated on a quarterly basis 
a specific allowance is determined for all loans which meet the definition of an impaired loan where the value of the underlying collateral can reasonably be evaluated and where the company has not already taken an interim charge off 
these are generally loans which are secured by real estate 
the bank obtains an updated appraisal for all impaired loans secured by real estate and collateral dependent residential mortgage loans greater than days delinquent 
the specific allowance represents the difference between the bank s recorded investment in the loan  net of any interim charge offs  and the fair value of the collateral  less estimated disposal costs 
a general allowance is determined for all other classified and non classified loans 
in determining the level of the general allowance  the bank segments the loan portfolio into various loan segments and classes 
the loan portfolio is further segmented by delinquency status and risk rating 
an estimated loss factor is then applied to each risk tranche 
if a loan secured by real estate becomes days delinquent  the bank obtains an updated appraisal which is subsequently updated annually as foreclosure timelines remain at elevated levels 
for these loans  the estimated loss represents the difference between the bank s recorded investment in the loan and the fair value of the collateral  less estimated selling costs 
for loans days delinquent not secured by real estate  the bank evaluates the fair value of the collateral and personal guarantees  if any  and identifies an estimated loss for the difference between the bank s recorded investment in the loan and the fair value of the collateral  less estimated selling costs 
for loans which are not days delinquent a historical loss rate is determined for each loan segment 
to determine the loss rate the bank utilizes an average of loan losses as a percent of loan principal adjusted for the estimated probability of default 
the historical loss rate is adjusted for certain environmental factors including current economic conditions  regulatory environment  local competition  lending personnel  loan policies and underwriting standards  loan review system  delinquency trends  loss trends  nature and volume of the loan portfolio and concentrations of credit 
the bank also considered the likely adverse impact of superstorm sandy on historical loss rates 
existing economic conditions which the bank considered to estimate the allowance for loan losses include local trends in economic growth  unemployment and real estate value 
an overwhelming percentage of the bank s loan portfolio   is secured by real estate  whether one to four family  consumer or commercial 
additionally  most of the bank s borrowers are located in ocean and monmouth counties  new jersey and the surrounding area 
these concentrations may adversely affect the bank s loan loss experience should real estate values decline further or should the markets served continue to experience difficult economic conditions  including increased unemployment or should the area be affected by a natural disaster such as a hurricane or flooding 
see risk factors a continued downturn in the local economy or in local real estate values could hurt profits and risk factors superstorm sandy  or other natural disasters or hurricanes  could adversely affect asset quality and earnings 
management believes the primary risk characteristics for each portfolio segment are a continued decline in the economy generally  including sustained unemployment  a decline in real estate market values and possible 
table of contents increases in interest rates 
additionally  superstorm sandy may adversely affect real estate market values and borrowers ability to repay their obligations 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect the borrowers ability to repay the loans  resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of provisions 
accordingly  the bank has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in the loan portfolio 
although management believes that the bank has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
although management uses what it believes to be the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the bank s control 
reserve for repurchased loans the reserve for repurchased loans relates to potential losses on loans sold which may have to be repurchased due to an early payment default  or a violation of representations and warranties 
provisions for losses are charged to gain on sale of loans and credited to the reserve  which is part of other liabilities  while actual losses are charged to the reserve 
in order to estimate an appropriate reserve for repurchased loans  the bank considers recent and historical experience  product type and volume of recent whole loan sales and the general economic environment 
management believes that the bank has established and maintained the reserve for repurchased loans at adequate levels  however  future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary due to economic  operating or other conditions beyond the bank s control 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights msr the estimated origination and servicing costs of mortgage loans sold in which servicing rights are retained is allocated between the loans and the servicing rights based on their estimated fair values at the time of the loan sale 
servicing assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  net servicing income 
the estimated fair value of msr is determined through a discounted analysis of future cash flows  incorporating numerous assumptions including servicing income  servicing costs  market discount rates  prepayment speeds and default rates 
impairment of the msr is assessed on a quarterly basis on the fair value of those rights with any impairment recognized as a component of loan servicing fee income 
impairment is measured by risk strata based on the interest rate of the underlying mortgage loan 
the fair value of msr is sensitive to changes in assumptions 
fluctuations in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of msr 
in the event that loan prepayments continue to increase due to increased loan refinancing  the fair value of msr would likely decline 
in the event that loan prepayment activities decrease due to a decline in loan refinancing  the fair value of msr would likely increase 
additionally  due to the economic downturn  default rates and servicing costs may increase in future periods which would result in a decline in the fair value of msr 
any measurement of msr is limited by the existing conditions and assumptions utilized at a particular point in time  and would not necessarily be appropriate if applied at a different point in time 
impairment of securities on a quarterly basis the company evaluates whether any securities are other than temporarily impaired 
in making this determination  the company considers the extent and duration of the impairment  the nature and financial health of the issuer  the ability and intent to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and other factors relevant to specific securities  such as the credit risk of the issuer and whether a guarantee or insurance applies to the security 
if a security is determined to be 
table of contents other than temporarily impaired  the impairment is charged to income during the period the impairment is found to exist  resulting in a reduction to earnings for that period 
during  the company recognized an other than temporary impairment loss on equity securities of  as compared to no other than temporary impairment loss during as of december   the company concluded that any remaining unrealized losses in the securities available for sale portfolios were temporary in nature because they were primarily related to market interest rates  market illiquidity and wider credit spreads for these types of securities 
additionally  the company does not intend to sell the securities and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost 
future events that could materially change this conclusion and require an impairment loss to be charged to operations include a change in the credit quality of the issuers or a determination that a market recovery in the foreseeable future is unlikely 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk irr market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from irr inherent in its lending  investment and deposit taking activities 
the company s profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact the company s earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent or on the same basis 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages irr 
the principal objectives of the company s irr management function are to evaluate the irr inherent in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given the company s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
through such management  the company seeks to reduce the exposure of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the company monitors its irr as such risk relates to its operating strategies 
the bank s board has established an asset liability committee alco consisting of members of the bank s management  responsible for reviewing the asset liability policies and irr position 
alco meets monthly and reports trends and the company s irr position to the board on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have an impact on the earnings of the company 
the bank utilizes the following strategies to manage irr emphasizing the origination for portfolio of fixed rate mortgage loans generally having terms to maturity of not more than fifteen years  adjustable rate loans  floating rate and balloon maturity commercial loans  and consumer loans consisting primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit  attempting to reduce the overall interest rate sensitivity of liabilities by emphasizing core and longer term deposits  and managing the maturities of wholesale borrowings 
the bank may also sell fixed rate mortgage loans into the secondary market 
in determining whether to retain fixed rate mortgages or to purchase fixed rate mortgage backed securities  management considers the bank s overall irr position  the volume of such loans originated or the amount of mbs to be purchased  the loan or mbs yield and the types and amount of funding sources 
the bank periodically retains fixed rate mortgage loan production or purchases fixed rate mbs in order to improve yields and increase balance sheet leverage 
during periods when fixed rate mortgage loan production is retained  the bank generally attempts to extend the maturity on part of its wholesale 
table of contents borrowings 
for the past few years  the bank has sold most year fixed rate mortgage loan originations in the secondary market 
the company currently does not participate in financial futures contracts  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  but may do so in the future to manage irr 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising interest rates  an institution with a negative gap position theoretically would not be in as favorable a position  compared to an institution with a positive gap  to invest in higher yielding assets 
this may result in the yield on the institution s assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap might experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities  which  consequently  may result in its net interest income growing at a faster rate than an institution with a positive gap position 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of an irr model 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which were anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
at december   the company s one year gap was positive as compared to negative 
at december  except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
loans receivable reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
loans were projected to prepay at rates between and annually 
mortgage backed securities were projected to prepay at rates between and annually 
money market deposit accounts  savings accounts and interest bearing checking accounts are assumed to have average lives of years  years and years  respectively 
prepayment and average life assumptions can have a significant impact on the company s estimated gap 

table of contents there can be no assurance that projected prepayment rates for loans and mortgage backed securities will be achieved or that projected average lives for deposits will be realized 
at december  months or less more than months to year more than year to years more than years to years more than years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets interest earning deposits and short term investments investment securities fhlb stock mortgage backed securities loans receivable total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities money market deposit accounts savings accounts interest bearing checking accounts time deposits fhlb advances securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percent of total interest earning assets interest earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments  scheduled rate adjustments and contractual maturities 
for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes loans held for sale and non performing loans gross of the allowance for loan losses  unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  loan prepayment rates and average lives of deposits would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in the calculation 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may be impaired in the event of an interest rate increase 

table of contents another method of analyzing an institution s exposure to irr is by measuring the change in the institution s net portfolio value npv and net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
npv is the difference between the net present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of an irr model which measures irr by modeling the change in npv and net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the following table sets forth the company s npv and net interest income projections as of december  and in thousands 
for purposes of this table  the company used prepayment and average life assumptions similar to those used in calculating the company s gap 
december  december  change in interest rates in basis points net portfolio value net interest income change in interest rates in basis points net portfolio value net interest income rate shock amount change npv ratio amount change rate shock amount change npv ratio amount change static static as is the case with the gap calculation  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the npv and net interest income irr measurements 
the model requires the making of certain assumptions which may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
first  the model assumes that the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured 
second  the model assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
third  the model does not take into account the company s business or strategic plans 
accordingly  although the above measurements do provide an indication of the company s irr exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s npv and net interest income and can be expected to differ from actual results
