item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for the delivery of products 
quantities of our products to be delivered and delivery schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in customers needs  customer orders generally can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
for these reasons  our backlog as of any particular date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
intellectual property we rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property ip 
we currently hold approximately issued patents  which principally cover aspects of the design and architecture of our ic and enterprise storage products 
in addition  we have over inventions in various stages of the patenting process in the united states and abroad 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that if challenged  will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
to protect our ip  we also rely on a combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements 
in the united states  our trademarks and registered trademarks include appliedmicro  amcc  apm  x gene  server on a chip  cloud server  otnsec  arming the cloud and hard silicon  among others 
in addition to our ip  we also rely upon licensing certain third party technologies for the development of our products 
see technology  above  for further information about such licenses 
as a general matter  the semiconductor and enterprise storage industries are characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other ip rights 
in the past we have been  and in the future may be  notified that we may be infringing on the ip rights of third parties 
in some cases  the third parties have demanded that we pay significant patent license fees in order to avoid litigation asserting ip infringement 
to date  we have refused to enter into any such patent license agreements 
we have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party ip rights by our products 
there can be no assurance that infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such matter  we could be required to pay substantial damages  which could include treble damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the ip rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
any limitations on our ability to market our products  any delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals that are and were used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
such regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
since  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp along with a large number of other companies that used omega chemical corporation in whittier  california to handle and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain remediation efforts at the omega chemical corporation site and the surrounding groundwater aquifers  which efforts are ongoing

item a 
risk factors 
before deciding to invest in us or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report and in our other filings with the sec 
we update our descriptions of the risks and uncertainties facing us in our periodic reports filed with the sec 
the risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our liquidity may deteriorate based on our future uses of cash although we currently believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  our cash balances could decrease significantly if we decide to pay for the remainder of the veloce acquisition consideration using a greater proportion of cash  instead of our common stock  than is currently anticipated  or if our normal operations require us to expend more cash than anticipated 
as a result of any of the above  we may be faced with liquidity issues and could elect or be required to pursue various options to raise additional capital or generate cash 
there can be no assurance that any of the options that we currently believe to be available will be viable in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  our cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
if we are unable to timely develop new products or new versions of products to replace our current products  our operating results and competitive position will be materially harmed 
our industry is characterized by intense competition  rapidly evolving technology and continually changing customer requirements 
these factors could render our existing products less competitive or obsolete 
accordingly  our ability to compete in the future will depend in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new generations and versions of our existing products that achieve market acceptance on a timely and cost effective basis  and to respond to changing requirements 
if we are unable to do so  our business  operating results and financial condition will be negatively affected 
the successful development and market acceptance of our products depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to our successful collaboration with our ecosystem and technology partners  our accurate prediction of changing customer requirements  timely development of new designs  timely qualification and certification of our products for use in electronic systems  continued availability on commercially reasonable terms of the manufacturing services purchased from and the technology components and tools licensed from third party suppliers  commercial acceptance and production of the electronic systems into which our products are incorporated  availability  quality  price  performance  power consumption  and size of our products relative to competing products and technologies  our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness  successful development of relationships with existing and potential new customers  maintaining compliance and compatibility with new and changing industry standards and requirements  our maintaining close working relationships with key customers so that they will design our products into their future products  our ability to develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  and our retention of key technical and design expertise within our employee ranks 
we have in recent years devoted substantial engineering and financial resources to designing  developing and rolling out new products and technologies and introducing several new products in our connectivity and computing business units 
however  there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful or that the products and technologies we have recently developed and which we are currently developing will achieve market acceptance 
if these products and technologies fail to achieve market acceptance  or if we are unable to continue developing new products and technologies that achieve market acceptance  our business  financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  for our x gene and other server processor products  we are a licensee of the arm v bit architecture and will depend upon our continuing license rights to that isa  including without limitation the timely completion and delivery by arm of various updates and other deliverables under the license agreement 
furthermore  the development and commercialization of new products incorporating arm architecture could be delayed if the ecosystem partners who rely on this architecture are unable to successfully establish their own operations on a timely basis including their continued access to and the use of the arm architectural licenses or if they are unable to work closely with arm in developing their products 
our significant investment in veloce may not result in the successful development and commercialization of new technologies or products 
in june  we completed the acquisition of veloce under a merger agreement we entered into with veloce in may  as amended in november and april pursuant to the merger agreement  the purchase price is estimated to be in the range of million up to million  depending upon the achievement and timing of multiple post closing product development milestones and technical performance results 
at this time  the eventual outcome of such milestones and performance results is not determinable and as such  we are unable to provide a narrower range for the estimated total merger consideration 
we will update the range in the future when additional relevant information is available 
even after the successful completion of the acquisition of veloce as described above  we may fail to appropriately integrate the operations of veloce into the company 
in addition  the departure from the company of one or more veloce management or engineering personnel could materially adversely affect our product development efforts for x gene and next generation products 
although we have spent considerable time and resources in the developmental effort  eventually we may be unsuccessful in developing  marketing and selling the products that are described in the merger agreement  in which case our investment in veloce would not bear any significant value to our business and would have a material adverse impact on our financial results and condition 
if we issue additional shares of stock in the future  it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
we have a significant number of authorized and unissued shares of our common stock available 
these shares will provide us with the flexibility to issue our common stock for proper corporate purposes  which may include making acquisitions including  without limitation  discharging our remaining purchase price obligations in the veloce acquisition through the use of stock  adopting additional equity incentive plans and raising equity capital 
any issuance of our common stock will result in immediate dilution of our stockholders 
in addition  the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may result in additional regulatory requirements  such as stockholder approval 
during the first or second quarter of fiscal  we expect to issue approximately million additional shares of our common stock as part of the veloce acquisition consideration 
thereafter  we have the ability to issue up to approximately million additional shares of our common stock as veloce acquisition consideration without obtaining stockholder approval 
the actual amount and timing of additional share issuances to be made in connection with veloce acquisition payments will be based upon numerous factors including  without limitation  the total amount of acquisition consideration to be paid  the market price of our common stock as of each payment date  and our available cash balances and liquidity requirements as of such dates  none of which are determinable at this time 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect competition to increase in these markets in the future 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect that domestic and international competition will increase in these markets  due in part to rapid technological advances  price erosion  changing customer preferences  deregulation  and evolving industry standards 
increased competition could result in significant price competition  reduced revenues  lower profit margins or loss of market share 
our ability to compete successfully in our markets depends on a number of factors  including our ability to partner with oem and channel partners who are successful in the market  success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  product quality  interoperability  reliability  performance and certification  our ability to attract and retain key engineering  operations  sales and marketing employees and management  customer support  time to market  price  production efficiency  design wins  expansion of production of our products for particular systems manufacturers  end user acceptance of the systems manufacturers products  market acceptance of competitors products  and general economic conditions 
we designed x gene for existing and emerging cloud and enterprise data centers 
existing data centers currently rely primarily on xeon server processors and related chipsets developed and marketed by intel 
as a result  we will compete with intel in the existing cloud and enterprise server infrastructure market 
in the cloud and enterprise server market  we will compete with intel xeon in addition to low power server silicon products from intel  amd  and a number of arm based server silicon vendors  including calxeda  cavium  texas instruments and others 
in the embedded computing silicon solutions market  we compete with technology companies such as broadcom  cavium and freescale semiconductor 
in addition  some of our customers and potential customers have internal integrated circuit designs or manufacturing capabilities with which we compete 
in the connectivity silicon solutions market segment  we compete primarily against companies such as broadcom  cortina and pmc sierra 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than we have 
we may also face competition from new entrants to our target markets  including larger technology companies that may develop or acquire differentiating technology and then apply their resources to our detriment 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and presences in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and in some cases operate their own fabrication facilities 
our competitors may offer enhancements to existing products  or offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements that are available to customers on a more timely basis than comparable products from us or that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to our products 
the introduction of enhancements or new products by our competitors could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
we and our customers face intense price pressure and competition from companies in lower cost countries such as china 
in response to these price pressures  our customers could require us to reduce prices which could impact our financial results adversely 
furthermore  our discrete legacy products are being and could continue to be integrated into asics or combined into single chip solutions that could cause our revenues from such products to decline at a faster rate 
as a result of each of these factors  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships increases the risk that we will not have an adequate supply of products to meet demand or that our cost of materials will be higher than expected 
we depend upon third parties to manufacture  assemble  package or test certain of our products 
as a result  we are subject to risks associated with our dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships  including pricing of foundry services and or other supply chain vendors or packaging and test service vendors such as tsmc  ibm  ase  spil  etc  reduced control over the supply chain process  delivery schedules and quality  inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs  the risks associated with transitioning our manufacturing supply from one foundry or other supplier to another  our ability to attract and retain key personnel and to maintain knowledge base  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  the potential lack of adequate capacity at the foundry during periods of excess demand  resulting in significant increases in lead time requirements and production delays  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory charges due to the higher level of inventories in response to the increased lead times  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential instability and business disruption in countries where third party manufacturers are located  potential misappropriation of our intellectual property  and potential foundry shortages when we commence manufacturing future products  especially those with nm technologies which could delay the supply of products to our customers 
our outside foundries and manufacturing  packaging and test service providers generally operate on a purchase order basis  and we have few long term supply arrangements with these suppliers 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than our competitors that use their own fabrication facilities or provide larger volumes of business to their outside foundries 
a manufacturing disruption or capacity constraint experienced by one or more of our outside foundries or service providers or a disruption of our relationship with an outside foundry or service provider  including discontinuance of our products by that foundry or service provider  would negatively impact the production and cost structure of certain of our products for a substantial period of time 
as our third party manufacturing suppliers extend their lead time requirements  we will likely need to also extend our lead time requirements to our customers 
this could cause our customers to lower their competitive assessment of us as a supplier and  as a result  we may not be considered for future design awards 
each of our ic products are generally only qualified for production at a single foundry 
these suppliers can allocate  and in the past have allocated  capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
there is also the potential that they may discontinue manufacturing our products or go out of business 
because establishing relationships  designing or redesigning silicon solutions  and ramping production with new outside foundries may take over a year  there is no readily available alternative source of supply for these products 
difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of outside foundries can lead to reduced yields of our ic products 
this risk is substantially higher with respect to the anticipated manufacture of our new x gene products at nanometers and smaller geometries 
the process technology of an outside foundry is typically proprietary to the manufacturer 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems may require cooperation between us and our manufacturer 
this risk could be compounded by the offshore location of certain of our manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
manufacturing defects that we do not discover during the manufacturing or testing process may lead to costly product recalls 
these risks may lead to increased costs or delayed product delivery  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
if the foundries or subcontractors we use to manufacture our products discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade their technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers  which would materially adversely affect our operating results and harm our reputation 
the transition to the next generation of manufacturing technologies at one or more of our outside foundries could be unsuccessful or delayed 
our requirements typically represent a very small portion of the total production of the third party foundries 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a producer will cease production of an older or lower volume process that it uses to produce our parts or raise the prices it charges us 
we cannot assure you that our external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of parts for our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
each of these events could increase our costs  lower our gross margin  cause us to hold more inventories or materially impact our ability to deliver our products on time 
as our volumes decrease with any third party foundry  the likelihood of unfavorable pricing increases 
some companies that supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which our products are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which our products are designed 
our restructuring activities could result in management distractions  operational disruptions and other difficulties 
over the past several years  we have initiated several restructuring activities in an effort to reduce operating costs and such restructuring activities are likely to continue 
in particular  in december  we implemented a board approved restructuring plan that resulted in an aggregate reduction in force of approximately of our employee headcount 
employees whose positions were eliminated in connection with these restructuring activities may seek employment with our competitors  customers or suppliers 
although each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us at the time of employment  which agreement contains covenants prohibiting among other things the disclosure or use of our confidential information and the solicitation of our employees  we cannot guarantee that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment  or that our key continuing employees will not be solicited to terminate their employment with us 
any additional restructuring efforts could divert the attention of our management away from our operations  harm our reputation  increase our expenses  increase the work load placed upon remaining employees and cause our remaining employees to lose confidence in the future performance of the company and decide to leave 
we cannot guarantee that any additional restructuring activities undertaken in future restructuring activities will be successful  or that we will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our previous  current or future restructuring plans 
in addition  if we continue to reduce our workforce  it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to new growth opportunities or remain competitive 
we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry processes or in achieving higher levels of design integration and  as a result  may experience reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
currently  we are shipping samples of our x gene nanometer product and we have a nm version of the product under development 
as smaller line width geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to integrate greater levels of functionality into our ic products and to transition our ic products to increasingly smaller geometries 
this transition will require us to redesign certain products and will require us and our foundries to migrate to new manufacturing processes for our products 
we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs and increase performance and we have designed ic products to be manufactured at nanometer and potentially smaller geometry processes 
we have in the past experienced difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies and new manufacturing processes 
these difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
the transition to smaller geometries is inherently more expensive and as we manufacture more products using smaller geometries  the incremental costs could have an adverse impact on our earnings 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our ic products to smaller geometry processes and at competitive pricing 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully and at competitive pricing 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries 
if we or our foundries experience significant delays in this transition or fail to implement this transition and at competitive pricing  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the gross margins for our products could decrease rapidly or not increase as forecasted  which will negatively impact our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
the gross margins for our solutions have declined in the past and may do so again in the future 
factors that we expect to cause downward pressure on the gross margins for our products include competitive pricing pressures  the cost sensitivity of our customers  particularly in the higher volume markets  new product introductions by us or our competitors  the overall mix of our products sold during a particular quarter  and other factors 
from time to time  for strategic reasons  we may accept orders at less than optimal gross margins in order to facilitate the introduction of new products or the market penetration of existing products 
to maintain acceptable operating results  we will need to offset any reduction in gross margins of our products by reducing costs  increasing sales volume  developing and introducing new products and developing new generations and versions of existing products on a timely basis 
if the gross margins for our products decline or not increase as anticipated and we are unable to offset those reductions  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
the current economic circumstances and uncertain political conditions could harm our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the economies of the united states and other developed or developing countries have experienced an economic downturn for the last several years 
while the us economy has recently begun to rebound from the economic downturn  we cannot predict whether this recovery will be sustained or will reverse course 
deteriorating economic conditions in certain countries  including several countries in europe  could adversely spiral and impact the global nascent recovery which could in turn adversely impact our revenues and financial results and condition 
the recent downturn resulted in a decline in our near term revenues 
our current operating plans are based on assumptions concerning levels of consumer and corporate spending 
if weak global and domestic economic and market conditions persist or deteriorate  we may experience further material impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition  which in turn could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
if economic conditions worsen  we may have to implement additional cost reduction measures or delay certain r d spending  which may adversely impact our ability to introduce new products and technologies 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
our portfolio primarily includes fixed income securities  closed end bond funds  mutual funds and preferred stock  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
the deterioration of these market prices may have an unfavorable impact on our portfolio and may cause us to record impairment charges to our earnings 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded approximately million in other than temporary impairment charges of our short term investments and marketable securities 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we did not record any other than temporary impairment charges 
if market prices continue to decline or securities continue to be in a loss position over time  we may recognize impairments in the fair value of our investments 
adverse economic and market conditions could also harm our business by negatively affecting the parties with whom we do business  including our business partners  our customers and our suppliers 
these conditions could impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased from us 
as a result  allowances for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable from our customers may increase 
in addition  our suppliers may experience financial difficulties that could negatively affect their operations and their ability to supply us with the parts we need to manufacture our products 
our product sales are concentrated among a few large customers 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
adverse economic and market conditions affecting these customers could adversely affect our financial operations and results 
we have invested  and will continue to invest  in privately held companies  most of which can still be considered to be in startup or developmental stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose all or substantially all of the value of our investments in these companies and  in some cases  we have lost all or substantially all of the value of our investment in such entities 
our operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our operating results are below the expectations of research analysts or investors  then the market price of our common stock could decline 
some of the factors that affect our quarterly and annual results  but which are difficult to control or predict  include those discussed elsewhere in this risk factors section  as well as the following fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  including as a result of slowing demand for our products or our customers products or over ordering or double booking of our products or our customers products  changes in the mix of product orders  the gain or loss of one or more key customers or their key customers  or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers  our ability to introduce  certify and deliver new products and technologies  including without limitation our x gene products  on a timely basis  the announcement or introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors  competitive pressures on selling prices  the ability of our customers to obtain components from their other suppliers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  including without limitation failure of x gene to be commercially accepted at the levels we anticipate  risks associated with our or our customers dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships  increases in the costs of products or discontinuance of products by our suppliers  the amounts and timing of meeting the specifications and expense recovery on non recurring engineering projects  the amounts and timing of costs associated with warranties and product returns  the amounts and timing of investments in r d  the product lifecycle and recoverability of architectural licenses  technology access fees and mask sets  the amounts and timing of the costs associated with payroll taxes related to stock option exercises or settlement of restricted stock units  the impact of potential one time charges related to purchased intangibles  the impact on interest income of a significant use of our cash for an acquisition  stock repurchase or other purpose  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit worthiness on the value and yield of our short term investment portfolio  the effects of changes in accounting standards  and the availability of ecosystem partners 
our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed if we do not achieve anticipated revenues 
we can have revenue shortfalls for a variety of reasons  including shortages of raw materials or production capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to their other customers  which may disrupt our ability to meet our production obligations  our customers may experience shortages from their suppliers that may cause them to delay orders or deliveries of our products  delays in the availability of our products or our customers products  delays in the availability of the software elements from third party vendors and ecosystem partners that may cause delays in customers using our hardware products resulting in further delays of bringing our product to market  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  declines in the average selling prices of our products  delays when our customers are transitioning from old products to new products  a decrease in demand for our products or our customers products  a decline in the financial condition or liquidity of our customers or their customers  the failure of our products to be qualified in our customers systems or certified by our customers  excess inventory of our products held by our customers  resulting in a reduction in their order patterns as they work through the excess inventory of our products  fabrication  test  product yield  or assembly constraints for our products that adversely affect our ability to meet our production obligations  the failure of one or more of our subcontract manufacturers to perform its obligations to us  our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies  products and technologies  and global economic and industry conditions 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules 
customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
because we do not have substantial non cancellable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not pay for these products  we could miss future revenue projections or incur significant charges against our income  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based on our expectations of future revenues 
we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
changes to production volumes and impact of overhead absorption may result in a decline in our financial condition or liquidity 
we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and are therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 
our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter  which we refer to as turns business 
we measure turns business at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment forecasts that we set entering the quarter 
historically  we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy  resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules 
shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments 
turns business correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times 
because turns business is difficult to predict  varying levels of turns business make our net sales more difficult to forecast 
if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns business in a particular quarter relative to our revenue forecasts  our revenue and operating results may suffer 
our business is dependent on the pace of recovery of the communications industry 
there can be no assurance that the recent slowdown in the adoption of technology  including without limitation optical transport network otn technology  in our connectivity business will reverse itself the near future 
it is possible that any reversal of the slowdown will take longer than previously anticipated  or that our estimated market share in the connectivity space is in fact much lower than we anticipate 
also  our product sales are concentrated among a few large customers 
adverse economic and market conditions affecting these customers could adversely affect our financial operations and results 
we are continuing to focus our current connectivity investments on high growth g and faster ethernet solutions  data center  otn and enterprise market opportunities while continuing to service the telecom sonet sdh market 
over time  we believe customers will transition from the sonet sdh standard to higher speed  lower power products that utilize the otn standard in order to support the increasing demand for transmission of data over networks 
however  the timing and extent of this transition is uncertain due to the significant investment that is needed to convert networks to the otn standard 
as such  the rate of conversion to the otn standard is  in part  greatly influenced by global economic market conditions 
recessionary type market conditions will result in a slower transition of networks to the otn standard 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our revenues will increase as the otn standard is adopted 
if the technology sector and the internet do not continue to grow  our business will suffer 
the technology equipment industry is cyclical and has in the past experienced significant and extended downturns 
the recent downturn was significant and we cannot predict if the current economic improvement is sustainable in the near future 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the continued growth of the technology sector and the internet 
we sell our communications ic products primarily to communications equipment manufacturers that in turn sell their equipment to customers that depend on the growth of the internet 
the past downturn has caused a reduction in capital spending on information technology 
while we are beginning to see indications of improvement  there are no guarantees that this growth will sustain  resulting in potential volatility 
if there is another downturn  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we are developing products for the cloud server market which is currently dominated by a few large potential customers 
if we are unable to partner with and sell our products to these customers  our future revenues from these products may be adversely impacted 
interruptions  delays  security breaches or other unauthorized activities at third party data centers or other cloud computing infrastructure providers could materially harm our business 
we conduct significant business functions and computer operations  including without limitation data storage and email  using the infrastructure systems of third party vendors  such as remote data centers  virtual servers and other cloud computing resources 
cloud computing is an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is stored outside of the user physical infrastructure and is delivered to and used by the user as an internet based application service 
these third party systems may experience cyber attacks and other security breaches  along with the possible risk of loss  theft or unauthorized publication of our technical  proprietary and trade secret information or other confidential information of our employees and customers 
any interruptions or problems at such data centers or other cloud computing facilities could result in significant disruptions to our business operations hosted at or affected by such site 
we do not control the operation of such data center or other providers  and each is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  vandalism  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
these third party vendor relationships present further risk and management challenges for us  including  among others confirming and monitoring the third party security measures  the potential for improper handling of or access to our data  and data location uncertainty  including the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions  where laws or security measures may be inadequate  or the unauthorized movement of technical data between locations in violation of applicable export laws 
we undertake substantial efforts to assure the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation  security and financial due diligence  contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards  and ongoing evaluation of third party compliance with the required standards 
while we expend significant resources on these measures  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks  breaches or other unauthorized activities or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 
our failure to effectively manage and communicate our strategies with our outsourced service providers  or their failure to perform as required or to properly protect our data  may result in operational difficulties which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  such data center and other providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to renew our agreements with the data center and other providers on commercially reasonable terms  we may experience costs or down time in connection with the transfer to new third party providers 
our business is dependent on selling to distributors and any disruption in their operations could materially harm our business sales to distributors accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
our largest distributor accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
we do not have long term agreements with our distributors and either party can terminate the relationship with little advance notice 
any future adverse conditions in the us and global economies or in the us and global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors 
any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition  during an industry or economic downturn  it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sell through of our products by our distributors which could cause them to hold excess inventories and reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in stock rotations 
the loss of one or more key customers  the diminished demand for our products from a key customer  or the failure to obtain certifications from a key customer or its distribution channel could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in any particular period 
based on direct shipments  net revenues to customers that were equal to or greater than of total net revenues were as follows wintec global logistics provider avnet distributor flextronics sub contract manufacturer hon hai sub contract manufacturer less than of total net revenues 
we have no long term volume purchase commitments from our key customers 
one or more of our key customers may discontinue operations as a result of consolidation  bankruptcy or otherwise 
reductions  delays and cancellation of orders from our key customers or the loss of one or more key customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
our agreements with customers typically are non exclusive and do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products 
we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our ability to maintain or increase sales to key customers and attract significant new customers is subject to a variety of factors  including customers may stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us  customers or prospective customers may not incorporate our products into their future product designs  the timing and success of new product introductions by customers  some of our customers may reduce or eliminate future purchase orders or design wins placed with us as an adverse reaction to our having sold patents to third parties that thereafter asserted the acquired patents in infringement actions brought against such customers  sales of customer product lines incorporating our products may rapidly decline or such product lines may be phased out  our agreements with customers typically are non exclusive and do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  many of our customers have pre existing relationships or may establish relationships with our current or potential competitors that may cause our customers to switch from using our products to using competing products  some of our oem customers may develop products internally that would replace our products  we may not be able to successfully develop relationships with additional network equipment vendors  our relationships with some of our larger customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products  and the impact of terminating certain sales representatives or sales personnel as a result of a company workforce reduction or otherwise 
the occurrence of any one of the factors above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any significant order cancellations or order deferrals could cause unplanned inventory growth resulting in excess inventory  which may adversely affect our operating results 
our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages or cancel orders if their inventories are too high 
major inventory corrections by our customers are not uncommon and can last for significant periods of time and affect demand for our products 
customers may also cancel or delay orders in anticipation of new products or for other reasons 
cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could reduce our profit margins by reducing sales prices  incurring inventory write downs or writing off additional obsolete products 
the book to bill ratio is commonly used by investors to compare and evaluate technology and semiconductor companies 
the book to bill ratio is a demand to supply ratio that compares the total amount of orders received to the total amount of orders filled 
this ratio tells whether the company has more orders than it delivered if greater than  has the same amount of orders that it delivered equals  or has less orders than it delivered under 
though the ratio provides an indicator of whether orders are rising or falling  it does not consider the timing of  or if the order will result in future revenues and the effect of changing lead times on bookings 
as lead times increase  customers will place orders sooner  therefore increasing our bookings and book to bill ratio 
increasing lead times from our suppliers cause us to make commitments for inventory purchases earlier in our production cycle which in turn increases our risk of having excess inventory 
in addition  some of our suppliers are delivering based on allocations which in turn cause us to increase our inventory levels 
we must balance our inventory levels between the risk of losing a significant customer to a competitor because we cannot meet our customer requirements and the risk of having excess inventory if a significant order is cancelled 
in addition  from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside contract manufacturers  suppliers and foundries  we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering has in the past resulted and may in the future result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize  or other factors render our products less marketable 
if we are forced to hold excess inventory or we incur unanticipated inventory write downs  our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
inventory fluctuations could affect our results of operations and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times  meet customer expectations and guard against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
customer orders for our products typically have non standard lead times  which make it difficult for us to predict revenues and plan inventory levels and production schedules 
if we are unable to plan inventory levels and production schedules effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
there is no guarantee that design wins will become actual orders and sales 
a design win occurs when a customer or prospective customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be integrated with the customer product 
there can be delays of several months or more between the design win and when a customer initiates actual orders of our product 
following a design win  we will commit significant resources to the integration of our product into the customer product before receiving the initial order 
receipt of an initial order from a customer following a design win  however  is dependent on a number of factors  including the success of the customer product  which cannot be guaranteed 
the design win may never result in an actual order or sale of our products 
if we fail to generate revenues after incurring substantial expenses to develop a product  our business and operating results would suffer 
our customers products typically have lengthy design cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customers may need more than six months to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional nine months or more to begin volume production of the equipment or devices that incorporate our product 
due to this generally lengthy design cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we cannot guarantee that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or devices  and that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in this lengthy design cycle increases the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
while our customers design cycles are typically long  some of our product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to r d  product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant r d and marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to mitigate those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
an important part of our strategy is to focus on data center markets 
if we are unable to further expand our share of these markets or accurately anticipate or react timely or properly to emerging trends  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
our target markets  including the data center market  frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if our products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  or if our products fail to be certified by oems  we will lose business from an existing or potential customer and may not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins or certification until the next product transition occurs 
if we fail to develop products with required features or performance standards  or if we experience a delay as short as a few months in certifying or bringing a new product to market  or if our customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products  our revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period 
we expect a significant portion of our revenues to continue to be derived from sales of products based on current  widely accepted transmission standards 
if the communications market evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or gain substantial market acceptance 
if we do not identify and pursue the correct emerging trends and align ourselves with the correct market leaders  we may not be successful and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
customers for our products generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources 
some customers have traditionally used these resources to internally develop their own products 
the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products 
future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third party sourcing for products as an alternative to in house development 
network equipment vendors may in the future continue to use internally developed components 
they also may decide to develop or acquire components  technologies or products that are similar to  or that may be substituted for  our products 
if our network equipment vendor customers fail to accept our products as an alternative  if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products  or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our business strategy contemplates the potential acquisition of other companies  products and technologies  as well as the divestitures of subsidiaries or operations that no longer are material to our core business 
merger and acquisition activities involve numerous risks and we may not be able to conduct these activities successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems that could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties  making and increasing equity investments in companies developing such products  technologies or businesses  and divesting business units or subsidiaries and selling product lines and technologies that are no longer material to our core business  are all part of our long term business strategy 
the risks involved with merger and acquisition  equity investment and divestiture activities include diversion of management attention from our core businesses  failure to integrate or potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired companies  potential difficulties resulting from the divestiture of business operations  with respect to protecting the confidentiality of proprietary information and trade secrets not subject to the divestiture  difficulties and risks associated with the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying critical accounting policies  such as the valuation of merger consideration affecting operating expenses as reflected in the reduction in r d expense recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal  difficulty in completing an acquired company in process research or development projects  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired company products or services  both expected and unanticipated adverse effects from the loss of technologies  patents and other intellectual property  and personnel relating to divested subsidiaries  product lines and businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  costs associated with acquisitions  investments and divestitures  difficulties associated with combining  integrating or separating acquired or divested operations  products or technologies  difficulties and risks associated with entering and competing in markets that are unfamiliar to us  and ability of the acquired companies to meet their financial projections and the effect of divesting subsidiaries and businesses on our revenues and margins 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition and investment activities  mergers or acquisitions  we could  issue stock that would dilute  in some cases significantly  our current stockholders percentage ownership  use a significant portion of our cash reserves or incur debt  assume liabilities  including unanticipated third party litigation and other unknown liabilities and unanticipated costs  events or circumstances  incur adverse tax consequences  incur amortization or impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  depreciation and deferred compensation  and incur large one time charges and immediate write offs 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our past acquisitions required us to capitalize significant amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
as a result of the past slowdown in our industry and reduction of our market capitalization  we have been required to record significant impairment charges against these assets as noted in our previous financial statements 
additionally  the past deterioration in market values has had an unfavorable impact on our valuations which are part of the goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment tests 
there can be no assurances that market conditions will not deteriorate further or that our market capitalization will not decline further 
at march   we had million of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to take significant charges as a result of impairment to the carrying value of the purchased intangible assets  due to further adverse changes in market conditions 
in april  we completed the sale of of the issued and outstanding shares of tpack a s  a limited liability company organized under the laws of denmark and a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and certain specified intellectual property assets owned by the company related to tpack business for an aggregate consideration of million  payable in cash 
refer to footnote to notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the sale 
in january  we sold certain assets relating to our active optical technology platform to volex plc for a purchase price of approximately million 
pursuant to the asset sale  appliedmicro and volex will share ownership of the associated active optical patent portfolio and are expected to collaborate on certain next generation optical interconnect products and solutions 
in june  we acquired veloce for an initial consideration of million with additional consideration payable based upon the achievement and timing of multiple post closing product development milestones and technical performance results 
pursuant to the merger agreement  the purchase price is currently estimated to be in the range of million up to million  depending upon the actual achievement of such milestones and performance results 
at this time  the eventual outcome of one milestone is not determinable and  as such  we are unable to provide a narrower range for the estimated total merger consideration 
we will update the range in the future when additional relevant information is available 
our industry and markets are subject to consolidation  which may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand 
there has been industry consolidation among communications ic companies  network equipment companies and telecommunications companies in the past  such as the acquisition of seamicro inc by advanced micro devices in february  netlogic microsystems  inc by broadcom corporation in february and gennum corporation by semtech corporation in march we expect this consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in evolving markets 
consolidation may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations because we rely heavily on international sales 
international sales account for a significant part of our revenues and may account for an increasing portion of our future revenues 
the revenues we derive from international sales are subject to certain risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations to the extent that this impacts our customers purchasing power  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  rising protectionism and other trade barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  natural disasters  increased exposure to liability under u 
s and foreign anti corruption laws and regulations  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in managing distributors  reduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in some countries  burdens of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  potentially adverse tax consequences  and uncertain economic conditions that may worsen or sustain improvements which trail those in the united states 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date primarily in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
some of our customer purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  which may differ significantly from laws in the united states  or may require that dispute resolution occur in a foreign country 
as a result  our ability to enforce our rights under such agreements may be limited compared with our ability to enforce our rights under agreements governed by laws in the united states and adjudicated in the united states 
our foreign operations may subject us to risks relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act  other us and foreign anti bribery statutes and similar foreign regulations that may have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations are subject to laws regarding the conduct of business overseas  such as the us foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  and other anti bribery regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we do business  such as china  india  vietnam  and in europe 
the fcpa prohibits the provision of illegal or improper inducements to foreign government officials in connection with obtaining or retaining business overseas or to secure an improper commercial advantage 
the fcpa also requires us to keep accurate books and records of business transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls 
violations of the fcpa  anti bribery statutes or other similar laws by us  any of our foreign subsidiaries  or any of our or their employees  executive officers  distributors or other agents or intermediaries could subject us and the individuals involved to significant criminal or civil liability 
in recent years  the department of justice and sec have significantly stepped up their investigation and prosecution of alleged fcpa violations 
any such allegations of non compliance with the fcpa  anti bribery statutes or other similar laws could harm our reputation  divert management attention and result in significant expenses  and could therefore materially harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our portfolio of short term investments is exposed to certain market risks 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  net of tax 
our investment portfolio is exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of the issuers  as well as to the risks of default by the issuers and lack of overall market liquidity 
substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit rating risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced 
increases in interest rates or decreases in the credit worthiness of one or more of the issuers in our investment portfolio could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
as of march  the unrealized losses on these securities that were not previously written down as an other than temporary impairment charge were approximately  of which substantially the entire amount has been at an unrealized loss for greater than months 
if the fair value of any of these securities does not recover to at least the amortized cost of such security or we are unable to hold these securities until they recover  we may be required to record a decline in the carrying value of these securities 
our operating results depend on manufacturing output and yields of our ics and printed circuit board assemblies  which may not meet expectations 
the yields on wafers we have manufactured decline whenever a substantial percentage of wafers must be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer are nonfunctional 
such declines can be caused by many factors  including minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  design issues  defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer and difficulties in the fabrication process 
design iterations and process changes by our suppliers can cause a risk of defects 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose  are time consuming and expensive to remedy and can result in shipment delays 
we estimate yields per wafer and final packaged parts in order to estimate the value of inventory 
if yields are materially different than projected  work in process inventory may need to be re valued 
we may have to take inventory write downs as a result of decreases in manufacturing yields 
we may suffer periodic yield problems in connection with new or existing products or in connection with the commencement of production using a new design geometry or at a new manufacturing facility 
the complexity of our products may lead to errors  defects and bugs  which could negatively impact our reputation with customers and result in liability 
products as complex as ours may contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products have in the past experienced such errors  defects and bugs 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of the products or result in a costly recall and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
errors  defects or bugs could cause problems with device functionality  resulting in interruptions  delays or cessation of sales to our customers 
we may also be required to make significant expenditures of capital and resources to resolve such problems 
we cannot assure you that problems will not be found in new products  both before and after commencement of commercial production  despite testing by us  our suppliers or our customers 
any such problems could result in delays in development  manufacture and roll out of new products  additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us  and loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship out products could levy fines or restrict our ability to import and export products 
a significant majority of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and re exporting of products 
in addition to local jurisdictions export regulations  our us manufactured products and products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports 
these laws and regulations include  but not limited to  the export administration regulations ear  and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the us department of the treasury  office of foreign assets control ofac 
licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries as well as for the transfer of certain information and technology to certain foreign countries  foreign nationals or other prohibited persons within the united states or abroad 
a determination by the us or local government that we have failed to comply with these or other import or export regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of import or export privileges  fines  civil and criminal penalties and seizure of products 
such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our ability to meet our sales and earnings forecasts 
further  a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export to previously permitted countries  customers  distributors or other third parties 
any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products will be implemented by the united states or other countries 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered effective  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k for that fiscal year 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of control must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of internal control can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud involving a company have been  or will be  detected 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  our internal control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
in addition  as a result of the reduction in the number of employees assigned to financial reporting and regulatory compliance functions in connection with recently completed and anticipated future restructuring activities  we may be at increased risk of failures in our internal control systems 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
our management has concluded  and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested  that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of march  we cannot be certain in future periods that any control deficiencies that may constitute one or more significant deficiencies as defined by the relevant auditing standards or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified by us or our independent registered public accounting firm 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  including any failure to implement or difficulty in implementing required new or improved controls  our business and results of operations could be harmed  the results of operations we report could be subject to adjustments  and we could fail to be able to provide reasonable assurance as to our financial results or the effectiveness of our internal controls or meet our reporting obligations 
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report our internal control over financial reporting as ineffective 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered effective  we may experience a restatement like we have in the past of our financial statements 
any restatement or actual or perceived weakness or conditions in our internal control over financial reporting  or in management assessment thereof  could result in a loss of public confidence in our reported financial information  and have a material adverse effect on our business  the market price of our common stock  and our ability to access capital markets  and may result in litigation claims  regulatory actions and may otherwise divert management attention and resources 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key senior management  design engineering  sales  marketing  and manufacturing personnel  our ability to identify  hire and retain additional  qualified personnel and successful succession planning 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our senior management and engineering personnel and successful succession planning 
in addition  as our core business and technologies continue to evolve  including without limitation with respect to our growth and expansion into next generation cloud infrastructure and data center markets  our success will depend on effectively transitioning to certain new management and engineering personnel most capable of supporting that evolution 
the loss of key senior executives or engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design  product and test engineers 
we may not be able to continue to identify  attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business  or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employment in the future 
also  the departure from the company of one or more veloce management or engineering personnel could materially adversely affect our product development efforts for x gene and next generation products 
we also face the risks associated with our former employees assisting their new employers to recruit our key talent  in violation of their contractual non solicitation and confidentiality covenants and other legal obligations to us 
our efforts to enforce these contractual covenants and legal obligations has required  and may in the future require  us to incur significant litigation expenses and devote significant management attention 
furthermore  while we encourage our employees to abide by all contractual and legal obligations owed to their former employers  there can be no assurance that we will not be the target of allegations made by other companies that we have  directly or indirectly  unlawfully solicited their employees to join us 
there are significant costs associated with recruiting  hiring and retaining personnel  as well as significant actual and potential losses to our business arising from the delays in or cancellation of technology development  product completion and roll out  customer design wins and product orders  and sales revenues caused by the departure of key engineering resources 
periods of contraction in our business may also inhibit our ability to attract and retain our personnel 
as we respond to declining revenues and or implement additional cost improvement measures such as reductions in force  our remaining key employees may lose confidence in the future performance of the company and decide to leave 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to our product development or other aspects of our business 
to manage our operations effectively  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems and to successfully hire  train  motivate  and manage our employees 
our ability to supply a sufficient number of products to meet customer demand  and customer demand itself  could be severely hampered by natural disasters or other catastrophes  the effects of war  acts of terrorism  global threats or shortages of water  electricity or other supplies 
a significant portion of our r d and supply chain operations are located in asia 
these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes  floods and tsunamis  like those that struck japan and thailand 
in addition  our headquarters and satellite offices in california are located in areas containing known earthquake fault lines 
we do not have earthquake insurance for these facilities  because adequate coverage is not offered at economically justifiable rates 
a significant natural disaster  shortage of water or other catastrophic event affecting us  our suppliers or our customers could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats  including  but not limited to  the outbreak of epidemic disease  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to local and global economies and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we could incur substantial fines  litigation costs and remediation expenses associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
these regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
since  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp along with more than other companies that used omega chemical corporation waste treatment facility in whittier  california the omega site 
the us environmental protection agency epa has alleged that the omega site failed to properly treat and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain ongoing remediation efforts at the omega site and with respect to the regional groundwater allegedly contaminated thereby 
in  the prps were sued by a chemical company located downstream from the omega site  seeking a judicial determination that the omega prps are responsible for some or all of the plaintiff potential liability to clean up groundwater contamination beneath plaintiff site  that action has been stayed since march to allow for further delineation of the regional groundwater contamination 
in september  epa issued an interim remedial action proposal  designed to arrest the further spread of groundwater contamination  in the next few months epa is expected to notify the prps with requests to implement the interim remedial action 
in september  a toxic tort litigation that was commenced in against omega and the prp group by individuals alleging injuries caused by the omega site that was settled and dismissed with prejudice 
based on currently available information  we have a loss accrual for the omega site that is not material and we believe that the actual amount of costs and liabilities will not be materially different from the amount accrued 
however  proceedings are ongoing and the eventual outcome of the clean up efforts and the pending litigation matter is uncertain at this time 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that any eventual outcome will have a material adverse effect on our operations but we cannot guarantee this result 
in  the us supreme court decided us v 
burlington northern santa fe railway co  s 
ct 
 which determined that hazardous substance cleanup liability need not be joint and several in all cases 
as a result of this decision  the liability is potentially divisible among the prps at an earlier stage in superfund cases such as omega 
at this time we do not know and cannot predict the full impact of this decision on our liability 
in addition  in january  as a result of the prp group modification of its liability allocation formulae and the withdrawal of prp group members  our proportional allocation of responsibility among the prps for the current remediation space increased 
any future increases to our proportional allocation of responsibility among the prps or the future reduction of parties participating in the prp group due to additional member withdrawals could materially increase our potential liability relating to the omega site 
although we believe that we have been and currently are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in material compliance with these laws or regulations or that our future obligations to fund any remediation efforts  including those at the omega site  or expenses and potential liabilities relating to the pending litigation matter  will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
customer demands and new regulations related to conflict free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 
in august  under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of dodd frank  the sec adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and derivative metals referred to as conflict minerals  regardless of their actual country of origin in their products 
these new requirements will require companies to investigate  disclose and report whether or not such metals originated from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries 
in october  the national association of manufacturers and the us chamber of commerce filed a petition for review in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia in response to a piece of dodd frank regulation that requires public companies to disclose whether their products have been manufactured with these conflict minerals in countries where the sale of these minerals fuel humanitarian violence 
the outcome of this suit is uncertain and may impact the adoption of these new requirements 
in january  the sec s conflicts minerals disclosure rules became effective  requiring companies to make their first conflict minerals disclosures on or before may  for the calendar year 
we are currently evaluating the disclosure requirements in order to comply with these disclosures  if any  within the prescribed time frame 
in the semiconductor industry  these minerals are most commonly found in metals 
as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free metals  we cannot be sure that our contract manufacturers and other suppliers will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
also  since our supply chain is complex and some suppliers will not share their confidential supplier information  we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free 
some customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it becomes unsalable as a result of these regulations 
environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 
we are subject to various state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment  including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection  treatment  recycling and disposal of certain products 
such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate  including various european union eu member countries 
for example  the eu has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs and the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directives 
rohs prohibits the use of lead and other substances in semiconductors and other products put on the market after july  the weee directive obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment on the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment  register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment  and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment 
there can be no assurance that similar programs will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs  possible delays in delivering products  and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future product replacements if the cost were to become prohibitive 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately 
we rely in part on patents to protect our ip 
we cannot assure you that any of our issued patents will adequately protect the ip in our products and processes  will provide us with competitive advantages  will not be challenged by third parties or that  if challenged  any such patents will be found to be valid or enforceable 
in addition  there can be no assurance our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved or that we will successfully prepare and file patent applications with respect to new inventions potentially subject to patent protection 
others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents we currently hold or that may be issued to us 
to protect our ip  we also rely on the combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements  and licensing arrangements 
despite these efforts  we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent ip or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or ip  or disclose such ip or trade secrets  or that we can meaningfully protect our ip 
a failure by us to meaningfully protect our ip could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  suppliers  customers  licensees and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
also  former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors and we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our network to misappropriate our proprietary information or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we could be harmed by litigation involving patents  proprietary rights or other claims 
in the past we have sold to third parties  including non practicing entities also known as npes or patent trolls  groups of patents previously issued to or acquired by us that we deemed to be no longer essential to our core product lines and technologies 
certain npe acquirors have brought and may in the future bring legal actions asserting infringement of the acquired patents against various defendants  including customers or potential customers of ours 
although we are expressly licensed and our customers are similarly protected under such acquired patents with respect to all products sold by us  nevertheless certain customers  against whom the npes have asserted infringement of the acquired patents by products other than ours eg  products internally developed by the customer or purchased from third party suppliers other than us  have reacted adversely to us based on our initial sale of the acquired patents to the npes 
such adverse reactions have included  among other things  demands that we reimburse the customer for expenses incurred in defending against or settling the legal action  as well as threats to reduce or discontinue the customer current or future business with us 
there can be no assurance that any such expense reimbursement payments or other financial consideration extended to such affected customers or any actual reduction or discontinuance of product sales to such affected customers would not adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce our ip rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims that our products are infringing or misappropriating the ip rights of third parties 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other ip rights 
currently we are not a named defendant in any ip infringement lawsuits 
nevertheless  as our products and ip become instantiated in more and more customer products and applications  and as patent infringement litigation brought by our competitors  npes and patent licensing companies is on the rise  we are at an increased risk of being named as a defendant in such litigation 
due in part to the factors described above  we have been or currently are subject to the following having information about our products and technologies subpoenaed  and our employees deposed  in patent litigation between other third parties  demands that we enter into expensive licenses of third party patent portfolios in order to avoid being named as a defendant in future ip infringement suits  claims  contractual or otherwise  demanding that we indemnify or reimburse customers or end users of our products with respect to their potential liability  including without limitation defense costs  arising from third party ip infringement claims brought against them  and demands from customers that we enter into springing licenses that prospectively grant such customers and related parties automatic license rights to any patents we sell or otherwise divest control over in specified transactions 
such claims and demands could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any litigation relating to the ip rights of third parties would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the ip rights of the third party claiming infringement 
a license might not be available on reasonable  economic and other terms or at all 
from time to time  we may be involved in litigation relating to other claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business 
the ultimate outcome of any such litigation matters could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
in the future  the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general economic and market conditions and in response to fluctuations in our anticipated or actual operating results  our announcement of actual results or financial outlook that are higher or lower than market or analyst expectations  changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other semiconductor companies or companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors  fluctuations in the anticipated or actual operating results or growth rates of our customers  peers or competitors  technological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor  communications or information technology markets  the commencement or outcome of litigation or governmental investigations  changes in ratings and estimates of our performance  or loss of coverage  by securities analysts  positive or negative commentary about our business or prospects by industry bloggers and journalists  volume fluctuations due to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  management changes  our inclusion in certain stock indices  and general economic and market conditions 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  particularly semiconductor companies 
in some instances  these fluctuations appear to have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies 
whether or not our stock is part of one or more index funds could have a significant impact on our stock 
we cannot assure you that our stock will be part of any index fund 
in addition  the past decline and inconsistent recovery of the financial markets and related factors beyond our control  including the credit and mortgage crisis in both the us and worldwide  may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly 
delaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  as amended  and our bylaws  as amended and restated  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our directors and management 
these provisions include the following the ability of the board of directors to issue up to million shares of blank check preferred stock with terms designed to prevent or delay a takeover attempt  as described further below  the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  the requirement for advance notice for nominations of directors for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting  the ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval  the requirement that any stockholder derivative actions and certain other intra corporate disputes be litigated solely and exclusively in delaware state court the right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors and the prohibition of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control  as the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit our consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of our assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit  restrict or significantly delay large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
although we believe these provisions in our charter and bylaws and under delaware law collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in any event  these provisions may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
any such delay or prevention could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

overview the company applied micro circuits corporation appliedmicro  apm  amcc  the company  we or our is a global leader in computing and connectivity solutions that span embedded computing  telco  and solutions for next generation cloud infrastructure and data centers 
our products include the x gene tm arm bit server on a chip tm solution  or x gene  designed for cloud data center and enterprise applications 
x gene began sampling in silicon to several current and prospective customers and ecosystem partners in march we currently expect x gene to be in production by the end of calendar year and to begin generating sales revenue during calendar year we believe that x gene is the first  and currently the only  arm bit server solution sampling today 
in addition to having a time to market advantage  we believe x gene will lead the next generation cloud data center silicon market by addressing the need for high performance  lower total cost of ownership silicon and system solutions 
x gene builds upon our solid base business of providing energy efficient  sustainable computing and connectivity solutions 
our embedded computing products are deployed in applications in markets such as control and data plane functionality  wireless access points  residential gateways  wireless base stations  storage controllers  network attached storage  network switches and routing products  and multi function printers 
our connectivity products address high growth segments including   and gbps solutions serving data center and service provider market opportunities 
our connectivity products include framer mapper devices for optical transport network otn equipment and physical layer devices that transmit and receive signals in a very high speed serial format 
our corporate headquarters are located in sunnyvale  california 
sales and engineering offices are located throughout the world 
as of march   our business had two reporting units  computing and connectivity 
since the start of fiscal  we have invested a total of million in the research and development r d of new products  including higher speed  lower power and lower cost products  products that combine the functions of multiple existing products into single highly integrated solutions  and other products to expand and complete our portfolio of communications solutions including our arm bit based server product development 
these products  and our customers products for which they are intended  are highly complex 
due to this complexity  it often takes several years to complete the development and qualification of a product before it enters into volume production 
accordingly  we have not yet generated significant revenues from some of the products developed during this time period 
in addition  downturns in the telecommunications market can severely impact our customers business and often result in significantly less demand for our products than was expected when the development work commenced 
we implemented a restructuring program during december to reorganize our operations and reduce our workforce and related operating expenses 
the plan includes eliminating job redundancies and reducing our current workforce by approximately employees 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million for employee severance expenses and million for an asset impairment during the twelve months ended march  the asset impairment related to the impairment of the unamortized value of a software intellectual property license  which the company no longer intends to use to develop new products 
we incurred cash expenditures of approximately million during the twelve months ended march  for employee severance expenses and anticipate that the restructuring plan will reduce ongoing headcount expenses by approximately million to million annually and other additional operational expenses by million to million annually commencing fiscal acquisition of veloce on june  the closing date  the company completed its acquisition of veloce pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  entered into as of may  the initial agreement  as amended by amendment no 
to agreement and plan of merger  entered into as of november  the first amendment  and amendment no 
to agreement and plan of merger  entered into as of april  the second amendment and  collectively with the initial agreement and the first amendment  the merger agreement 
the first amendment was amended  restated and replaced in its entirety by the second amendment 
the terms of the merger agreement included an initial consideration amount of million  payable to holders of veloce common stock options that were vested on the closing date and holders of veloce common stock and stock equivalents collectively  veloce equity holders  and to veloce stock equivalents that had not yet been allocated to individuals unallocated veloce units 
during the twelve months ended march   as part of the above arrangement  we issued approximately million shares valued at approximately million and paid approximately million in cash 
the merger agreement further provides for payments of additional merger consideration contingent upon the achievement of certain post closing product development milestones 
the total estimated consideration to be paid is based upon the benchmarks achieved during simulations that were performed during the third quarter of fiscal and correlating the results of the simulations to the contractual terms included in the merger agreement 
as a result of higher than expected benchmarks achieved during simulations  the total estimated consideration to be paid was updated during fiscal from a previous estimated maximum of approximately million to the contractual maximum of million 
the consideration that we will be obligated to pay  incremental to the initial consideration  will be payable upon completion of the respective performance milestones and can be settled in cash or the company common stock or a combination of cash and stock  at the election of the company 
the company has treated the veloce merger as a reorganization under section of the internal revenue code in its and veloce tax returns 
we believe that the requirements to qualify as a reorganization under the code will be met 
accordingly  the company intends to issue at least an additional approximately million of the company common stock as veloce merger consideration  assuming that the maximum consideration amount of million is paid 
for accounting purposes  the costs to be incurred in connection with the development milestones relating to veloce is considered compensatory and is recognized as r d expense 
recognition of these costs as expense will generally occur when certain development and performance milestones become probable of achievement and are deemed earned 
however  the value allocated to the unallocated veloce units will not be recognized as r d expense until distribution of the underlying units occurs 
as of march   the company has completed the first performance milestone and assessed the second performance milestone relating to the veloce project as probable of achievement 
the third and final performance milestone is currently not yet believed to be probable of attainment as of march  total r d expenses expected to be recognized in connection with the first and second performance milestones is approximately million including the initial consideration of million  which includes the costs associated with unallocated veloce units that have not been expensed as these units have not been distributed as of march  cumulative r d expenses recognized in connection with the achievement of the first and second milestone through march  is million 
see note and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  expenses recognized in connection with the achievement of the first and second performance milestones was million 
the veloce accrued liability included on the consolidated balance sheets is based upon the amount of r d expense recognized in connection with the development of the veloce performance milestones less amounts paid either in cash or our common stock 
veloce consideration that has been accrued as of march   is classified as long term if payments of the consideration is expected to occur beyond a month period 
approximately million of veloce consideration is expected to be payable upon the attainment of the first two veloce development and performance milestones and is expected to be paid over multiple quarters 
as of march   million has been paid and we expect that an additional million will be paid in cash and stock by september  additional consideration may become payable if the third and final performance milestone is completed 
summary financials the following tables present a summary of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and dollars in thousands fiscal year ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue increase decrease change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss the following tables present a summary of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and dollars in thousands fiscal year ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue increase decrease change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss net revenues 
we generate revenues primarily through sales of our ic products  embedded processors and printed circuit board assemblies to oems  such as alcatel lucent  ciena  cisco  brocade  fujitsu  hitachi  huawei  juniper  ericsson  nec  nokia siemens networks  and tellabs  who in turn supply their equipment principally to communications service providers 
on a sell through basis  we had approximately days of inventory in the distributor channel at march  as compared to days at march  the decrease in inventory days was due to higher distributor sell through revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year offset by higher overall net inventory in the distributor channel 
the gross margins for our solutions have from time to time  in the past declined 
some factors that has caused downward pressure on the gross margins for our products include competitive pricing pressures  unfavorable product mix  the cost sensitivity of our customers particularly in the higher volume markets  new product introductions by us or our competitors  and capacity constraints in our supply chain 
from time to time  for strategic reasons  we may accept orders at less than optimal gross margins in order to facilitate the introduction of  or  market penetration of our new or existing products 
to maintain acceptable operating results  we will need to offset any reduction in gross margins of our products by reducing costs  increasing sales volume  developing and introducing new products and developing new generations and versions of existing products on a timely basis 
we classify our revenues into two categories based on the markets that the underlying products serve 
the categories are computing and connectivity 
we use this information to analyze our performance and success in these markets  including our strategy to focus on the transition to the large growth data center market 
we are continuing to focus our current connectivity investments on high growth g  g and faster ethernet solutions  data center  otn and enterprise market opportunities while continuing to service the telecom sonet sdh market 
over time  we believe customers will transition from the sonet sdh standard to higher speed  lower power products that utilize the otn standard in order to support the increasing demand for transmission of data over networks 
however  the timing and extent of this transition is uncertain due to the significant investment that is needed to convert networks to the otn standard 
as such  the rate of conversion to the otn standard is  in part  greatly influenced by global economic market conditions 
recessionary type market conditions will result in a slower transition of networks to the otn standard 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our revenues will increase as the otn standard is adopted 
the portion of our business represented by connectivity revenues attributable to our otn and gigabit or faster ethernet products and that attributable to our sonet sdh and legacy switch products for the fiscal years ended march   and was and  and  and and  respectively 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory corrections  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on the sales  pricing and gross margins of our products  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  and market new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and communications markets  combinations of companies in our customer base  resulting in the combined company choosing our competitor s ic standardization rather than our supported product platforms  the gain or loss of one or more key customers  or their key customers  or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers  our expectation of a market ramp for our products could be incorrect and such ramp could get pushed out or not happen at all  our ability to meet customer demand due to capacity constraints at our suppliers  and natural disasters that could affect our supply chain or our customer s supply chain which would affect their requirements of our products 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations for the three fiscal years ended march  may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
based on direct shipments  net revenues to customers that were equal to or greater than of total net revenues were as follows wintec global logistics provider avnet distributor flextronics sub contract manufacturer hon hai sub contract manufacturer less than of total net revenues for period indicated 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
net revenues by geographic region were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended march  united states of america taiwan hong kong china europe japan malaysia singapore other asia other change in revenues was primarily due to shift in customer demand and continuing geographic changes to macro economic conditions 
our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars  other than revenues that account for less than of our total revenues  which are denominated primarily in the danish kroner 
in april  we completed the sale of our wholly owned danish subsidiary  tpack a s refer to note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
research and development 
total consolidated r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs including stock based compensation of employees engaged in research  design and development activities including amounts relating to veloce  costs related to engineering licenses and design tools  subcontracting costs and facilities expenses 
we believe that a continued commitment to r d is vital to our goal of maintaining a leadership position with innovative products 
in addition to our internal r d programs  our business strategy includes acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties 
we currently expect that future acquisitions of products  technologies or businesses may result in substantial additional on going r d costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses including stock based compensation  professional and legal fees  corporate branding and facilities expenses 
we currently expect that future acquisitions of products  technologies or businesses may result in substantial additional on going sg a costs 
key non gaap measurements 
we use certain non gaap metrics such as adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda to measure our performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as net loss income  less interest income  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  amortization of intangibles and other non recurring and or non cash items 
the following table reconciles adjusted ebitda to the accompanying financial statements in thousands fiscal years ended march  net loss adjustment to net loss interest and other income  net stock based compensation expense warrant expense amortization of purchased intangibles restructuring charges  net veloce accrued liability impairment of marketable securities acquisition related recoveries charges depreciation and amortization gain on sale of assets impairment gain on strategic investments  net impairment of notes receivable and other assets other and income tax adjustment adjusted ebitda for non gaap purposes  any gain or loss relating to marketable securities is not recognized until the underlying securities are sold and the actual gain or loss is realized 
for non gaap purposes  amortization adjustment is related to certain prepaid software intellectual property licenses 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful supplemental measure of our operation s performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the accounting impact of the company s financing strategies  tax provisions  depreciation and amortization  restructuring charges  stock based compensation expense  veloce accrued liability and certain other operating items 
we adjust for these excluded items because we believe that  in general  these items possess one or more of the following characteristics their magnitude and timing is largely outside of the company s control  they are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business in the ordinary course  they are unusual or infrequent and the company does not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business  or they are non cash expenses 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda is used by our management as a measure of operating efficiency and overall financial performance for benchmarking against our peers and competitors and is used as a metric to determine the performance vesting of our three year rsu grants issued in may the ebitda grants and may the ebitda grants which are expected to expire unvested when the program concludes in may 
management believes adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business 
management also believes that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate the company 
we also assess the performance of our business on a non gaap basis  excluding the impact of expenditures relating to our x gene product development costs 
non gaap net loss income is derived by excluding certain items required by gaap  such as stock based compensation charges  amortization of purchased intangibles  veloce acquisition consideration  restructuring charges  impairment of strategic investments  impairment of notes receivable and other assets  other than temporary impairment on investments  income taxes  and other one time and or non cash items 
in addition  when x gene product development related expenditures are excluded from the above  we derive the adjusted non gaap income from our base business ngibb 
the following table reconciles gaap net loss to the ngibb in thousands except for per share data fiscal years ended march  gaap net loss adjustments stock based compensation expense warrant expense amortization of purchased intangibles restructuring charges  net veloce accrued liability impairment of marketable securities acquisition related recoveries charges gain on sale of assets impairment gain on strategic investments  net impairment of notes receivable and other assets other and income tax adjustment total gaap to non gaap adjustments non gaap net loss income x gene product development costs ngibb diluted income per share shares used in calculating diluted income per share these amounts relate to direct expenditures associated with the x gene product development and does not include costs incurred relating to the veloce accrued liability 
we believe that ngibb is a useful supplemental measure for investors as it helps them view the performance of the ongoing base business without the effect of unusual or infrequent costs including non cash expenditures and also excluding an unusual and very significant r d project 
the measure is useful for investors to evaluate and compare the results of operations of the company to its peers in a more meaningful way and allows investors to assess the health and performance of the base business 
ngibb is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
ngibb should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be consistent with the presentation used by other companies 
the book to bill ratio is another metric commonly used by investors to compare and evaluate technology and semiconductor companies 
the book to bill ratio is a demand to supply ratio that compares the total amount of orders received to the total amount of orders filled 
this ratio tells whether the company has more orders than it delivered if greater than  has the same amount of orders that it delivered equals  or has less orders than it delivered under 
though the ratio provides an indicator of whether orders are rising or falling  it does not consider the timing of or if the orders will result in future revenues and the effect of changing lead times on bookings 
our fourth quarter book to bill ratio at march   and was  and  respectively 
our annual book to bill ratio at march   and was approximately  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to inventory valuation and capitalized mask set costs  which affect our cost of sales and gross profit  the valuation of purchased intangibles  which has in the past affected  and could in the future affect  our impairment charges to write down the carrying value of purchased intangibles and the amount of related periodic amortization expense recorded for definite lived intangibles  the valuation of the veloce consideration which affects operating expenses  and an evaluation of other than temporary impairment of our investments  which affects the amount and timing of write down charges 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for stock based compensation and revenue recognition 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying these critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management s estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
investments we hold a variety of securities that have varied underlying investments 
we review our investment portfolio periodically to assess for other than temporary impairment 
we assess the existence of impairment of our investments in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
the factors used to determine whether an impairment is temporary or other than temporary involves considerable judgment 
the factors we consider in determining whether any individual impairment is temporary or other than temporary are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost  the nature of underlying assets including the degree of collateralization  the financial condition  credit rating  market liquidity conditions and near term prospects of the issuer 
if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date  an assessment would have to be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
if we decided to sell the security  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred 
however  if we do not intend to sell the debt security  we shall consider available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis due to cash  working capital requirements  contractual or regulatory obligations indicate that the security will be required to be sold before a forecasted recovery occurs 
if it is more likely than not that we are required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred 
if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security  we would not be able to assert that we will recover its amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security 
therefore  in those situations  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred 
we use present value cash flow models to determine whether the entire amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered 
we will compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security 
an other than temporary impairment is said to have occurred if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded approximately million in other than temporary impairment charges 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we did not record any other than temporary impairment charges 
as of march   we did not record an impairment charge in connection with other securities in a continuous loss position fair value less than carrying value with unrealized losses of  as we believe that such unrealized losses are temporary 
in addition  we also had million in unrealized gains 
veloce consideration we periodically evaluate the progress of the development work that is being performed in connection with our contractual arrangement with veloce 
based on such an evaluation as well as considering various other qualitative factors  we estimate the total value of the development work being performed  and assess the timing and probability of attaining contractually defined performance milestones 
upon assessing a performance milestone as probable of achievement  r d expense is recognized based upon the estimated stage of development of that milestone and the estimated value associated with each performance milestone 
the amount of r d costs recognized in connection with the veloce consideration excludes any value relating to veloce common stock that has not been allocated to individuals unallocated veloce units 
payment of the veloce consideration will occur based upon when a performance milestone is completed  and upon satisfaction of vesting requirements  if applicable 
significant judgment is required to estimate the total value of the veloce development work  assess when a performance milestone is probable of achievement and estimating the timing of when the performance milestones will be completed 
we rely on discussions with internal technical personnel and using various qualitative and quantitative factors  including  but not limited to  overall complexity  stage of development and progress made to date  results of testing  and consideration as to the nature of the remaining development work  to assess probability of attaining the performance milestones defined in the merger agreement 
if based on our assessment we believe attainment of a performance milestone is probable  we will recognize expenses related to the estimated stage of development for the performance milestone  excluding the value relating to the unallocated veloce units 
as of march   we believe that the first two performance milestones are probable of attainment  and the third and final performance milestone is currently not yet believed to be probable of attainment 
the estimated total value of the veloce consideration is currently based upon the benchmarks that were achieved during simulations that were performed during the third quarter of fiscal and correlating the results of the simulations to the contractual terms included in the merger agreement 
as a result of higher than expected benchmarks achieved during simulations  the total estimated value to veloce has been updated from a previous estimated maximum of million to the contractual maximum of million 
as a result of this increase in value  the estimated value relating to the first and second performance milestone was also increased 
total r d expenses expected to be recognized upon completion of the first and second performance milestones is approximately million including the initial consideration of million  of which approximately million has been recognized through march  during the twelve months ended march   expenses recognized in connection with first and second performance milestones were million and million  respectively 
see note and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for future demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and net operating results 
any impairment charges taken establishes a new cost basis for the underlying inventory and the cost basis for such inventory is not marked up on changes in circumstances until a gain is realized upon its eventual sale 
this accounting is consistent with the guidance provided by sab topic bb 
to illustrate the sensitivity of inventory valuations to future estimates  as of march   reducing our future demand estimate to six months would decrease our current inventory valuation by approximately million and increasing our future demand forecast to months would increase our current inventory valuation by approximately million 
purchased definite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an asset or asset group is less than its carrying value and may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of an asset or asset group is not recoverable if the amount of undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate including any net proceeds expected from the disposal of the asset are less than its carrying value 
when we identify an impairment has occurred  we reduce the carrying value of the assets to its comparable market value if available and appropriate or to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on four basic criteria there is evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue until the applicable customer s acceptance criteria have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
our standard terms and conditions of sale do not allow for product returns and we generally do not allow product returns other than under warranty or stock rotation agreements 
revenue from shipments to distributors is recognized upon shipment 
in addition  we record reductions to revenue for estimated allowances such as returns not pursuant to contractual rights  competitive pricing programs and rebates 
these estimates are based on our experience with stock rotations and the contractual terms of the competitive pricing and rebate programs 
royalty revenues are recognized when cash is received  only when royalty amounts cannot be reasonably estimated 
royalty revenues are based upon sales of our customers products that include our technology 
shipping terms are generally fca free carrier shipping point 
if actual returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  we would record additional reductions to revenue 
from time to time we generate revenue from the sale of our internally developed intellectual property ip 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of ip when all basic criteria outlined above are met  which is generally when the payments are received 
mask costs we incur significant costs for the fabrication of masks used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our products 
if we determine  at the time the costs for the fabrication of masks are incurred  that technological feasibility of the product has been achieved  we consider the nature of these costs to be pre production costs 
accordingly  such costs are capitalized as property and equipment under machinery and equipment and are amortized as cost of sales over approximately three years  representing the estimated production period of the product 
we periodically reassess the estimated product production period for specific mask sets capitalized 
if we determine  at the time fabrication mask costs are incurred  that either technological feasibility of the product has not occurred or that the mask is not reasonably expected to be used in production manufacturing or that the commercial feasibility of the product is uncertain  the related mask costs are expensed to r d in the period in which the costs are incurred 
we will also periodically assess capitalized mask costs for impairment 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  total mask costs capitalized were million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  are required to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model which is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ significantly from those estimated 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock based awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
we currently estimate when and if performance based grants will be earned 
if the awards are not considered probable of achievement  no amount of stock based compensation is recognized 
if we consider the award to be probable  expense is recorded over the estimated service period 
to the extent that our assumptions are incorrect  the amount of stock based compensation recorded will be increased or decreased 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were million  representing a decrease of from the net revenues of million for the fiscal years ended march  we classify our revenues into two categories based on the markets that the underlying products serve 
the categories are computing and connectivity 
we use this information to analyze our performance and success in these markets 
see the following table dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  amount of net revenue amount of net revenue decrease change computing connectivity during the fiscal year ended march   our computing revenues declined by while our connectivity revenues declined by 
the overall revenue decline was spread across both the computing and connectivity product families and was a result of lower demand for our products due to overall softness in the macro conditions and due to the roll off of legacy products as we continue to focus on the development of our new products 
in addition  the revenues for our connectivity products were lower due to the delay in the overall otn infrastructure build out

increases in r d expenses  despite reductions in our headcount  were primarily driven by the effect of a ramp up in the costs relating to the x gene bit arm server on a chip platform product development efforts  and costs incurred on our developmental effort relating to other new products 
the increase in r d expenses of for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was primarily due to million for veloce merger consideration costs which includes approximately million of expense related to the acceleration of veloce warrants  million in consumable equipment and software cost  million in development cost related to new products  million in stock based compensation charges  million in third party foundry cost  million each in packaging cost and other engineering costs and million in customer funded non recurring engineering payments offset by a decrease of million each in printed circuit board cost and contractor cost and million in small tools and supplies cost

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details relating to the veloce warrants 
stock based compensation expense will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations  although it will have no impact on its overall financial position 
restructuring charges  net 
we implemented a restructuring program during december to reorganize our operations and reduce our workforce and related operating expenses 
the plan includes eliminating job redundancies and reducing our current workforce by approximately employees 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million for employee severance expenses and million for an asset impairment during the twelve months ended march  the asset impairment related to the impairment of the unamortized value of a software intellectual property license  which we no longer intend to use to develop new products 
as part of our ongoing cost reduction efforts  we could implement additional restructuring programs and may incur significant additional restructuring charges 
we incurred cash expenditures of approximately million during the twelve months ended march  for employee severance expenses and anticipate that the restructuring plan will reduce ongoing headcount expenses by approximately million to million annually and other additional operational expenses by million to million annually 
the savings from the restructuring action started commencing fiscal  when the plan was implemented 
the restructuring charges recorded during the fiscal year ended march  was primarily for employee severance expenses

vesting of the ebitda and ebitda grants is subject to i the company s performance as measured by earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and ii individual performance as measured by the accomplishment of goals and objectives 
vesting of our performance retention grants are subject to i the accomplishment of goals and objectives of the individual s business unit and ii individual performance as measured by the accomplishment of individual goals and objectives 
the weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is months 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards 
the value of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted and the then current fair values 
the amount of unearned stock based compensation currently estimated to be expensed from now through fiscal related to unvested share based payment awards at march  is million  which includes stock based compensation from veloce  our vie 
this expense relates to equity instruments already issued and will not be affected by our future stock price 
restructuring charges  net

the april restructuring plan included eliminating or relocating positions 
as a result of the april restructuring program  we recorded a charge of million for employee severance expenses 
we anticipate this restructuring plan will reduce our ongoing net operating expenses by million to million annually

veloce merger on june  the closing date  we completed our acquisition of veloce pursuant to the terms of the agreement and plan of merger  entered into as of may  the initial agreement  as amended by amendment no 
to agreement and plan of merger  entered into as of november  the first amendment  and amendment no 
to agreement and plan of merger  entered into as of april  the second amendment and  collectively with the initial agreement and the first amendment  the merger agreement 
the first amendment was amended  restated and replaced in its entirety by the second amendment 
the terms of the merger agreement include the payment of initial consideration of up to million  payable in shares of company common stock and or cash at our election to the holders of veloce common stock  veloce stock options that were vested on the closing date  and veloce stock equivalents 
during the twelve months ended march   as part of the above arrangement  we issued approximately million shares valued at approximately million and paid approximately million in cash 
to the extent payments of the million are settled in the company common stock  and relate to shares of veloce stock that were outstanding at the date of the closing of the merger  the value of the company common stock used to settle the veloce obligation is fixed at per share fixed shares 
the balance of the million or approximately million will be paid over multiple quarters and will include approximately million fixed shares and at least million in cash for a total value of million 
the remaining amount will be settled in a combination of cash and shares of the company common stock valued at the then current market price 
payment of the remaining veloce consideration will occur based upon when each performance milestone is completed and when satisfaction of vesting requirements  if applicable  are met 
as of march   we believe that the first two performance milestones are probable of attainment  and the third and final performance milestone was not believed to be probable of attainment as of march  approximately million of veloce consideration is expected to be payable upon the attainment of the first two veloce development and performance milestones and is expected to be paid over multiple quarters 
as of march   million has been paid to date and we expect that an additional million will be paid in cash and stock by september  additional consideration may become payable if we are able to complete the third and final performance milestone 
the veloce accrued liability included on the consolidated balance sheets is based upon the amount of r d expense recognized in connection with the development of the veloce performance milestones less amounts paid either in cash or our common stock 
the total estimated value of the veloce merger consideration is based on the company achieving certain performance benchmarks defined under the merger agreement within a certain time period 
we performed various simulations during the third quarter of fiscal the results of the simulations exceeded expectations for certain of the benchmarks defined under the merger agreement  and as a result the estimated maximum value of the veloce merger consideration was increased from approximately million to the contractual maximum of million  based on the company current expectations regarding the achievement of such product development milestones 
as such  the total estimated value of the veloce merger consideration has been updated to be in the range of million to million  depending upon the actual achievement of the product development milestones and technical performance results 
the consideration that we will be obligated to pay  incremental to the initial consideration  will be payable upon completion of the respective performance milestones  the issuance of the remaining veloce stock equivalents and any vesting requirements  if applicable  and can be settled in cash or the company common stock  at the election of management 
liquidity we currently believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least the next months 
we expect to satisfy the veloce related payment obligations using a combination of cash and the issuance of shares of common stock 
we expect our resources to be sufficient to make the above described veloce related payments while maintaining adequate cash to run our operations 
in april  we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  tpack a s  for an aggregate consideration of million  payable in cash refer to note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
our available liquidity could be adversely affected  however  if we decide to satisfy the veloce liability using a greater proportion of cash rather than our common stock  or if our normal operations require us to expend more cash than currently expected 
if our stock price declines  it could result in a higher dilution to our stockholders 
as a result of any of the above  we could elect or be required to pursue various options to raise additional capital or generate cash 
there can be no assurance that any of the options that we currently believe to be available will be viable in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all

at the time this rule b plan was cancelled  we repurchased million shares at a weighted average price of per share under this rule b plan 
we also utilize structured stock repurchase agreements to buy back shares which are prepaid written put options on our common stock 
we pay a fixed sum of cash upon execution of each agreement in exchange for the right to receive either a pre determined amount of cash or stock depending on the closing market price of our common stock on the expiration date of the agreement 
upon expiration of each agreement  if the closing market price of our common stock is above the pre determined price  we will have our cash investment returned with a premium 
if the closing market price is at or below the pre determined price  we will receive the number of shares specified at the agreement inception 
any cash received  including the premium  is treated as additional paid in capital on the balance sheet 
we did not enter into any structured stock repurchase agreements during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   we entered into structured stock repurchase agreements totaling million 
for those agreements that settled during the fiscal year ended march   we received million in shares of our common stock at an effective purchase price of per share from the settled structured stock repurchase agreements

other our aggregate fixed commitments payable over the next four years for licensing fees relating to our r d efforts  including our licensed ip  technology  product design  test and verification tools  are approximately million 
these amounts are also included in the table below 
the following table summarizes our contractual operating leases and other purchase commitments as of march  in thousands operating leases other purchase commitments total fiscal years ending march  total minimum payments includes liability for uncertain tax positions of million including interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as at march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and a decline in the stock market 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
we have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that attempt to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of interest rate trends 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us treasury  corporate bonds  commercial paper  mortgage backed and asset backed securities  and closed end bond funds  with credit ratings as specified in our investment policy 
we also have invested in preferred stocks  which pay quarterly fixed rate dividends 
we generally do not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which decrease market values 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
at march   our investment portfolio included short term securities classified as available for sale investments with an aggregate fair market value of million and a cost basis of million 
substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate risk  as well as credit risk and liquidity risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase or an issuer s credit rating or financial condition is weakened 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our short term investments held at march  in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points bps fair value as of march  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps bps available for sale investments the modeling technique used measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points  basis points  and basis points 
while this modeling technique provides a measure of our exposure to market risk  the current economic turbulence could cause interest rates to shift by more than basis points 
we also invest in equity instruments of private companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are valued based on our historical cost  less any recognized impairments 
the estimated fair values are not necessarily representative of the amounts that we could realize in a current transaction 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars  and as a result  we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we did not enter into any forward currency exchange contract during the fiscal year ended march  gains and losses are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period
