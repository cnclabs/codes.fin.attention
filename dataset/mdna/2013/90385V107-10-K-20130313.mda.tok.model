overview we are a leading developer and supplier of critical subsystems  primarily for the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
we also leverage the specialized skill sets required to support semiconductor capital equipment to serve the technologically similar markets in the flat panel  medical  energy and research industries  collectively referred to as other addressed industries 
we develop  design  prototype  engineer  manufacture and test subsystems which are highly specialized and tailored to specific steps in the semiconductor manufacturing process as well as the manufacturing process in other addressed industries 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of gas delivery systems and other critical subsystems including chemical mechanical planarization cmp subsystems  chemical delivery modules  top plate assemblies  frame assemblies  process modules and other high level assemblies 
on july   we completed the acquisition of american integration technologies llc ait  a supplier of critical subsystems to the semiconductor capital equipment  medical  energy  industrial and aerospace industries  for approximately million in cash and million shares of our newly issued common stock valued at million for a total purchase price of million 
we financed the cash portion of the merger  and repaid our existing indebtedness  by borrowing a total of million under a new senior secured credit facility  of which million represents borrowings under a term loan and million represents borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
our business has been substantially impacted by the continued semiconductor industry downturn which began during the third quarter of fiscal  as well as general economic conditions 
our sales were million for fiscal year  which included million of sales from ait  compared to million for fiscal year our three largest customers in were applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and intuitive surgical  two of which each accounted for or more in sales for fiscal year our three largest customers in were applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and fei company  two of which each accounted for or more in sales for fiscal year our three largest customers in fiscal year were applied materials  inc  lam research corporation and novellus systems  inc  two of which each accounted for or more of sales in fiscal year as a group  the respective customers accounted for  and of our sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
effective as of the end of the first quarter of  we agreed to terminate our arrangement with fei corporation  whereby fei would take back the manufacturing process they had been outsourcing to us since as part of an arrangement  we agreed to assist fei during the transition period through our third quarter of fiscal and  as a result  recorded revenue totaling million related to these efforts during that timeframe  offset by associated costs 
we announced in the third quarter of fiscal that one of our larger semiconductor equipment customers has decided to in source a portion of their gas panel business 
while this decision did not have a material impact on our revenue in fiscal  it could have a negative quarterly impact of to on total revenue by the end of fiscal 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue year ended december  december  december  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative acquisition costs total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes income tax provision benefit net income fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales sales for fiscal year decreased million  or  to million from million for fiscal year the sales decline primarily reflects a decrease in semiconductor revenues resulting from the continued semiconductor industry downturn which began during the third quarter of fiscal as well as the continued softness in the energy industry  partially offset by the inclusion of sales of million due to the acquisition of ait for the period july  through december  in addition  sales to fei decreased in fiscal to approximately million from million in fiscal  due to the termination of our relationship with fei in fiscal we expect the semiconductor equipment industry to begin a modest recovery in the first quarter of and therefore expect sales to increase modestly as well  as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  inventory reserves and labor and overhead  including depreciation  associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
gross profit for fiscal year decreased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for fiscal year our gross margin increased in fiscal from the comparable period in due primarily to a sales mix which included higher margin products  certain improvements in operational efficiencies at our manufacturing locations  favorable work order variances and a reduction in floor stock costs  partially offset by in an increase in inventory reserves 
we expect our gross profit to be slightly higher in the first quarter of  as compared to fiscal  due to expected higher revenues 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of activities related to new component testing and evaluation  test equipment and fixture development  product design  and other product development activities 
research and development expense for fiscal year was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales for fiscal year the decrease in expense for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily due to a reduction in expenses which are allocated from cost of sales to research and development activities 

table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our sales and service employees  salaries paid to our engineers who work with the sales and service employees to help determine the components and configuration requirements for new products and other costs related to the sales of our products 
sales and marketing expense for fiscal year decreased million to million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal year the decrease in expense is primarily due to a reduction in commission expense resulting from reduced sales 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and overhead associated with our administrative staff and professional fees 
general and administrative expense for fiscal year increased approximately million  or to million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  for fiscal year the increase when comparing fiscal with fiscal is primarily due to a amortization of finite lived intangibles associated with the ait acquisition of approximately million  b the inclusion of ait s general and administrative expenses since the date of acquisition of approximately million and c  an increase in stock compensation costs of approximately million 
acquisition costs acquisition costs were approximately million  or of sales  in fiscal which are costs associated with our purchase of ait and consist primarily of professional fees and services in connection with the acquisition 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year primarily due to the increase in debt in the third quarter of resulting from the acquisition of ait 
income tax provision our effective tax rate for fiscal year was a provision of compared to a benefit of for fiscal year the change in respective rates reflects  primarily  changes in our deferred tax assets and our accrual for uncertain tax positions  as well as a change in the geographic mix of worldwide earnings and financial results for the for fiscal year compared to fiscal year our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate for fiscal primarily due to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate for fiscal year primarily due to the favorable impacts of the release of a valuation allowance  discussed in further detail below  as well as to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
as of december   we maintained a full valuation allowance on the deferred assets of one of our china subsidiaries in the amount of  as we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in order to reverse a valuation allowance  us accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america suggests that we review our cumulative income loss in recent years as well as determine our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we reversed all of the valuation allowance related to our us federal and state deferred tax assets in the amount of million as we determined that it was more likely than not that it would generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the same character within the carryback or carry forward periods 
in assessing future accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america taxable income  we have considered all sources of taxable income 
table of contents available to realize its deferred tax assets including the future reversal of existing temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards  taxable income in carryback years and tax planning strategies 
if changes occur in the assumptions underlying our tax planning strategies or in the scheduling of the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales sales for fiscal year increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal year substantially all of the revenue increase for the year is attributable to volume increases with existing customers at relatively constant prices 
during the final two quarters of fiscal year  however  we experienced a slowdown in demand  primarily in the semiconductor equipment and energy spaces 
gross profit cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  inventory write downs  and labor and overhead  including depreciation  associated with the design and manufacture of products sold 
gross profit for fiscal year increased slightly to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  for fiscal year our gross margin for fiscal year decreased from fiscal year primarily as a result of relatively fixed overhead costs that did not decline proportionately to the decline in revenue experienced in the second half of fiscal year research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of activities related to new component testing and evaluation  test equipment and fixture development  product design  and other product development activities 
research and development expense for fiscal year was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales for fiscal year the increase in year over year expense was due to an increase in payroll and related costs 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our sales and service employees  salaries paid to our engineers who work with the sales and service employees to help determine the components and configuration requirements for new products and other costs related to the sales of our products 
sales and marketing expense for fiscal year increased million to million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal year the increase in year over year expense was primarily due to slight increases in payroll and related benefit costs as well as increased commissions due to increased revenue 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and overhead associated with our administrative staff and professional fees 
general and administrative expense for fiscal year increased approximately million  or to million  or of sales  compared with million  or of sales  for fiscal year the increase in dollars when comparing fiscal year with fiscal year is due primarily to an increase in payroll and related benefit costs associated with an increase in headcount for our singapore office  offset by reductions in fees for certain outside professional services 
the increase in general and administrative expense as a percent of sales for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year was due primarily to our investment in personnel in singapore  which resulted in general and administrative related personnel costs for fiscal year being a greater proportion of sales than in the prior year 

table of contents interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net for fiscal year was million compared to million for fiscal year the increase in expense for fiscal year was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense associated with an million term loan we entered into in october income tax provision our effective tax rate for fiscal year was a benefit of compared to a rate of for fiscal year the change in respective rates reflects  primarily  changes in our deferred tax assets and our accrual for uncertain tax positions  as well as a change in the geographic mix of worldwide earnings and financial results for the for fiscal year compared to fiscal year our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate for fiscal year primarily due to the favorable impacts of the release of a valuation allowance  discussed in further detail below  as well as to the geographic distribution of our world wide earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
as of december   we maintained a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of one of our china subsidiaries in the amount of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we reversed all of the valuation allowance related to our us subsidiaries 
the impact on our consolidated tax provision for fiscal was a net reversal of million of valuation allowance 
during fiscal we also released million of valuation allowance due to true ups and changes in deferred tax assets for which we maintained a full valuation allowance 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  stock compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  business combinations  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill  and equity incentives to employees to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition our revenue for fiscal years  and was highly concentrated in four oem customers in the semiconductor capital equipment  energy  flat panel and medical industries 
our standard arrangement for our customers includes a signed purchase order or contract  no right of return of delivered products and no customer acceptance provisions 
revenue from sales of products is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we ship the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product 
in arrangements which specify title transfer upon delivery  revenue is not recognized until the product is delivered 
in addition  if we have not fulfilled the terms of the agreement at the time of shipment  revenue recognition is deferred until fulfillment 

table of contents we assess collectability based on the creditworthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of  and do not require collateral from  our customers 
we have not experienced significant collection losses in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to assess collectability 
inventory valuation we write down the carrying value of our inventory to net realizable value for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of our estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
the inventory write downs are recorded as an inventory valuation allowance established on the basis of obsolete inventory or specific identified inventory in excess of established usage 
inherent in our estimates of demand and market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold either as a component of a subsystem or as separate inventory 
for fiscal years  and  respectively  we wrote down million  million and million in inventory determined to be obsolete 
accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings and tax regulations governing each region and are subject to judgments and estimates 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective tax rate as required 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of tax deductions  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
in determining whether the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  we make judgments with respect to whether we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets 
in order to reverse a valuation allowance  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america suggest that we review the our cumulative income loss in recent years as well as determine our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company maintained a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset of one of its china subsidiaries in the amount of million as we believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we reversed all of the valuation allowance related to our us federal and state deferred tax assets in the amount of million as we determined that it was more likely than not that it would generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  however  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  various states and foreign jurisdictions 
our through federal income tax returns are open to audit through the statute of limitations by the internal 
table of contents revenue service 
the company s through state income tax returns are open to audit by the california franchise tax board 
the company is also subject to examination in various other jurisdictions for various periods 
our federal returns are still open for fiscal years through due to the carryback of losses 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we may engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in reviewing management s determination of the fair values of acquired intangible assets such as trade name and customer relationships 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
goodwill  intangibles assets  and long lived assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we evaluate our goodwill and indefinite life tradename for impairment on an annual basis  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
in addition  we evaluate our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative changes in revenue of specific products or services  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and we continually apply judgment when performing these evaluations and continuously monitor for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining fair value  including long term revenue growth projections  undiscounted net cash flows  discount rates  recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies  volatility in our market capitalization and general industry  market and macroeconomic conditions 
it is possible that changes in such circumstances  or in the variables associated with the judgments  assumptions and estimates used in assessing fair value  would require us to record a non cash impairment charge 
equity incentives to employees we issue stock options and restricted stock units to our employees and outside directors and provide our employees the right to purchase common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
under current accounting guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service vesting period 
the black scholes option pricing model that we use was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of underlying stock 
our expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of our common stock 
we determined that historical volatility reflects market conditions and is a good indicator of future volatility 
our expected term represents the period that our stock based awards are 
table of contents expected to be outstanding and was determined based on our historical experience with similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 
liquidity and capital resources we have required capital principally to fund our acquisitions and working capital needs  satisfy our debt obligations  maintain our equipment and purchase new capital equipment 
as of december   we had cash of million compared to million as of december  our cash and cash equivalents  as well as cash generated from operations  was our principal source of liquidity as of december  for the twelve months ended december   we generated cash from operating activities of million compared to million for the comparable period of operating cash flows generated in the twelve months ended december   were from million of net income  net non cash activity  including depreciation of equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangibles and debt issuance costs of million and stock based compensation of million  and decreases in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in inventory reflects the substantial improvement in inventory management over the previous year 
these were offset by an increase in deferred tax assets of million  a net decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of million  and a decrease in accrued compensation and related benefits of million 
our cash flows from operations in any given period are largely driven by the timing of sales  the collection of accounts receivable and the payment of accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended december   was million  consisting of million for capital expenditures and million for the acquisition of ait 
investments in capital equipment in reflect our continued investment in our asian subsidiaries as well as our domestic operating units 
these investments are driven by the timing of our capital expenditures budget 
net cash provided by used in financing activities for the twelve months ended december   was million compared to million for the comparable period of for the twelve months ended december   our cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to proceeds from our new credit facility  offset by payments on our prior term debt and revolving line of credit and the payment of million in debt issuance costs relating to our new credit facility 
see borrowing arrangements below for information about our new borrowing arrangements we entered into in connection with our acquisition of ait on july  we anticipate that our existing cash balance and operating cash flow will be sufficient to service our indebtedness and meet our working capital requirements and technology development projects for at least the next twelve months 
the adequacy of these resources to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  the state of the worldwide economy  our ability to meet our financial covenants with our credit facility  the cyclical expansion or contraction of the semiconductor capital equipment industry and the other industries we serve and capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
in order to expand our business or acquire additional complementary businesses or technologies  we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings 
if required  additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders equity interest will be diluted and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
we may also require the consent of our new lenders to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 

table of contents in addition  the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at december   are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and unavailable for distribution in the form of dividends or otherwise 
accordingly  no provisions for us income taxes have been provided thereon 
we anticipate that we have adequate liquidity and capital resources and would not need to repatriate earnings 
as of december   we have cash of approximately million in our foreign subsidiaries 
borrowing arrangements on july   in connection with our acquisition of ait and the refinancing of our prior credit facility  we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement by and among the company  certain of our subsidiaries  silicon valley bank  us bank national association and hsbc bank collectively  the lenders 
the credit agreement provides for a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million the term loan and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of million the revolving credit facility  a letter of credit facility in the aggregate availability amount of million as a sublimit of such revolving credit facility the l c facility and a swingline sub facility in the aggregate availability amount of million as a sublimit of the revolving credit facility together with the term loan  the revolving credit facility and the l c facility  the credit facility 
on july   we borrowed an aggregate of million under the term loan and approximately million under the revolving credit facility 
the borrowed funds were used at the closing of our acquisition of ait to finance the acquisition and repay the outstanding balance of million to silicon valley bank as lender under our prior credit facility 
the prior credit facility was terminated in connection with this transaction 
the credit facility must be repaid in consecutive quarterly installments of million  with the first payment due on september   and with the balance of the then outstanding principal amount due at the final maturity  which is july  the revolving credit facility is available for the four year period beginning on july  the credit agreement includes customary representations  warranties  covenants and events of default 
the company and certain of our subsidiaries have agreed to secure all of our obligations under the credit agreement by granting a first priority lien in substantially all of our respective personal property assets subject to certain exceptions and limitations 
at our option  borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility subject to certain limitations bear interest at either a base rate or at the london interbank offered rate libor with the libor being adjusted for certain eurocurrency reserve requirements  if any  as described in the credit agreement  plus  in each case  an applicable margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
all loans described above made on july  were initially base rate loans  carrying interest of 
we expect  however  that the effective interest rate will be higher due to the incurrence of certain loan related costs of approximately million that will be treated as deferred interest and amortized over the life of the loan 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial covenants including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum domestic cash balances 
for the measurement periods ending in november and december of  we were not in compliance with such covenants 
on february   the company and the lenders amended the credit agreement in order for the lenders to waive such non compliance and to modify the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement  effective january  the credit agreement  as amended  requires us to comply with the following financial covenants a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  as amended  measured over the preceding four fiscal quarters  beginning as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal  of to  stepping up to to as of the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the first quarter of fiscal and thereafter  a maximum consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  as amended measured over the preceding four fiscal quarters  beginning  as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal  of

the credit agreement contains provisions requiring the following mandatory prepayments subject to certain exceptions and limitations i prepayments equal to of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of capital stock by our primary operating subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries  ii prepayments equal to of the net cash proceeds from the incurrence of any indebtedness by the company s primary operating subsidiary over  iii prepayments equal to the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales or insurance or condemnation recoveries  and iv annual prepayments in an amount equal to a of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  as amended if the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the term loan equals or exceeds million and b of excess cash flow if the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the term loan equals or exceeds million but is less than million 
the credit agreement also restricts us from declaring or paying any cash dividends 
as of december   our term loan and revolver balances were million and million  respectively  which are net of debt issuance costs of  and  respectively 
we have analyzed the credit agreement and determined that the outstanding balance of revolver debt should be classified as short term due to acceleration clauses in the agreement 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for the year ended december  capital expenditures only include ait s capital expenditures from its acquisition date of july  off balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented  we did not have any relations with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

table of contents contractual obligations other than operating leases for certain equipment and real estate and purchase order commitments primarily for inventory  we have no off balance sheet transactions  unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments and  other than the arrangements described under borrowing arrangements above  are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
the following table summarizes our future minimum lease payments  principal payments under debt obligations and our purchase obligations for the purchase of inventory as of december  in thousands thereafter total capital leases operating leases borrowing arrangement purchase order commitments total operating lease expense reflects a the lease for our headquarters facility in hayward  california that was modified in the fourth quarter of such that the lease now expires in  b the leases for manufacturing facilities in south san francisco that expire in c the leases for manufacturing facilities in china  singapore and the philippines that expire in thru  d the leases for manufacturing facilities in austin  texas that expire in and  d the leases for manufacturing facilities in chandler  arizona that expire in we have options to renew certain of the leases in south san francisco  hayward and austin which we expect to exercise 
amounts reflect our credit facility  under which we borrowed million under the term loan and approximately million under the revolving credit facility on july  the term loan must be repaid in consecutive quarterly installments of million and with the balance of the outstanding principal amount of the term loan due at the final maturity  which is july  the revolving credit facility is available for the four year period beginning on july  see note borrowing arrangements in notes to consolidated financial statements below 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign exchange rates currently  a significant majority of our sales and arrangements with third party suppliers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to material exchange rate fluctuations 
therefore  we do not expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to have a material effect on our results of operations 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive relative to competing products priced in such other currencies  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our foreign suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
chinese authorities recently relaxed controls of china s currency  the renminbi  and allowed the currency to strengthen against other world currencies  including the us dollar 
we continue to monitor any potential impact of the appreciation of the renminbi on our operations in china as well as globally 
changes in the value of the renminbi did not have a material impact on our results of operations for any of fiscal years  or 
table of contents interest rates our interest rate risk relates primarily to our party debt which totals million net of debt issuance costs as of december  and carries interest rates pegged to either the prime rate or libor 
an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would increase our interest expense by approximately million per quarter 
this would be partially offset by increased interest income on our invested cash 
conversely  an immediate decline of basis points in interest rates would decrease our interest expense by approximately million per quarter 
this would be partially offset by decreased interest income on our invested cash
