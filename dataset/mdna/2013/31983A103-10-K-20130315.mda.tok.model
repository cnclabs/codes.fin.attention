item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview first community bancshares  inc the company is a financial holding company that  through its bank subsidiary  provides commercial banking services and has positioned itself as a regional community bank and a financial services alternative to larger banks which often provide less emphasis on personal relationships  and smaller community banks which lack the capital and resources to efficiently serve customer needs 
the company has focused its growth efforts on building financial partnerships and more enduring and complete relationships with businesses and individuals through a very personal and local approach to banking and financial services 
the company and its operations are guided by a strategic plan which includes growth through acquisitions and through office expansion in market areas including virginia  west virginia  north carolina  south carolina  and tennessee 
while the company s mission remains that of a community bank  management believes that entry into new markets will accelerate the company s growth rate by diversifying the demographics of its customer base and customer prospects and by generally increasing its sales and service network 
economy the local economies in which the company operates are diverse and span a five state region 
the economies of west virginia and southwest virginia have significant exposure to extractive industries  such as coal  timber and natural gas 
the local economies in the central portion of north carolina have suffered in recent years due to foreign competition in both furniture and textiles  as well as consolidation in the financial services industry 
despite these detractions  the economies in this region continue to benefit from national companies operating in the triad and central piedmont area of north carolina 
the eastern virginia local economies have  in recent years  benefited from key corporate and government activities 
the economy in eastern tennessee continues to benefit from the stability of higher education  healthcare services  and tourism 
the local economies in the northeastern portion of south carolina and the southeastern portion of north carolina benefit from tourism and military activities 
despite the stable and positive aspects of the regional economies the company primarily operates in  these markets have experienced significant declines in residential development and construction which are consistent with national trends 
these declines have led to contraction in residential land development and construction  which has historically been important components of the company s lending activities 
the economies of the company s southwest virginia and west virginia markets have remained stable compared with the national economy and unemployment levels were generally lower than the national average at december  competition as the company competes for increased market share and growth in both loans and deposits  it continues to encounter strong competition from many sources 
many of the markets targeted by the company are also being entered by other banks in nearby and distant markets 
the expansion of banks  credit unions  and other non depository financial companies over recent years has intensified competitive pressures on core deposit generation and retention 
competitive forces impact the company through pressure on interest yields  product fees  and loan structure and terms  however  the company has countered these pressures with its relationship style of banking  competitive pricing  cost efficiencies  and a disciplined approach to loan underwriting 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the company s consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 

table of contents estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary principally when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded based upon the probability of occurrence of a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated by management primarily through the use of financial modeling techniques and appraisal estimates 
the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following is a summary of the company s more subjective and complex critical accounting policies 
in addition  the disclosures presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified investment valuation  determination of the allowance for loan losses  accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments 
investment securities management performs an extensive review of the investment securities portfolio quarterly to determine the cause of declines in the fair value of each security within each segment of the portfolio 
the company uses inputs provided by an independent third party to determine the fair values of its investment securities portfolio 
inputs provided by the third party are reviewed and corroborated by management 
evaluations of the causes of the unrealized losses are performed to determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary in nature 
considerations such as the company s intent and ability to hold the securities  recoverability of the invested amounts over the company s intended holding period  severity in pricing decline  credit rating  and receipt of amounts contractually due  among other factors  are applied in determining whether a security is other than temporarily impaired 
if a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management deems sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and is based on management s evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
the company consistently applies a review process to periodically evaluate loans for changes in credit risk 
this process serves as the primary means by which the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company determines the allowance for loan losses by making specific allocations to impaired loans that exhibit inherent weaknesses and various credit risk and by general allocations to commercial  residential real estate  and consumer loans by giving weight to risk ratings  historical loss trends and management s judgment concerning those trends  and other relevant factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  actual versus estimated losses  regional and national economic conditions  business segment and portfolio concentrations  industry competition and consolidation  and the impact of government regulations 
the foregoing analysis is performed by management to evaluate the portfolio and calculate an estimated valuation allowance through a quantitative and qualitative analysis that applies risk factors to those identified risk areas 
this risk management evaluation is applied at both the portfolio level and the individual loan level for commercial loans and credit relationships while the level of consumer and residential mortgage loan allowance is 
table of contents determined primarily on a total portfolio level based on a review of historical loss percentages and other qualitative factors including concentrations  industry specific factors and economic conditions 
the commercial portfolio requires more specific analysis of individually significant loans and the borrower s underlying cash flow  business conditions  capacity for debt repayment and the valuation of secondary sources of payment  such as collateral 
this analysis may result in specifically identified weaknesses and corresponding specific impairment allowances 
while allocations are made to specific loans and classifications within the various categories of loans  the allowance for loan losses is available for all loan losses 
the use of various estimates and judgments in the company s ongoing evaluation of the required level of allowance can significantly impact the company s results of operations and financial condition and may result in either greater provisions against earnings to increase the allowance or reduced provisions based upon management s current view of the portfolio and economic conditions and the application of revised estimates and assumptions 
differences between actual loan loss experience and estimates are reflected through adjustments that are made by increasing or decreasing the loan loss provision based upon current measurement criteria 
acquisitions and intangible assets the company may  from time to time  engage in business combinations with other companies 
purchase accounting requires the recording of underlying assets and liabilities of the entity acquired at their fair market value 
any excess of the purchase price of the business over the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
in instances where the price of the acquired business is less than the net assets acquired  a gain on purchase is recorded 
fair values are assigned based on quoted prices for similar assets  if readily available  or appraisal by qualified independent parties for relevant asset and liability categories 
financial assets and liabilities are typically valued using discount models which apply current discount rates to streams of cash flow 
all of these valuation methods require the use of assumptions which can result in alternate valuations and varying levels of goodwill and amounts of bargain purchase gain and  in some cases  amortization expense or accretion income 
management must also make estimates of useful or economic lives of certain acquired assets and liabilities 
these lives are used in establishing amortization and accretion of some intangible assets and liabilities  such as the intangible associated with core deposits acquired in the acquisition of a commercial bank 
goodwill is recorded as the excess of the purchase price  if any  over the fair value of the acquired net assets and is allocated to reporting units at acquisition 
goodwill is tested annually in the fourth quarter for possible impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its book value  including goodwill step 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its book value  no goodwill impairment exists 
however  if the book value of the reporting unit is greater than its determined fair value  goodwill impairment may exist and further testing is required to determine the amount  if any  of the actual impairment loss step 
the step test utilizes a combination of two methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units 
the company maintains two reporting units  community banking and insurance services 
for both reporting units  a discounted cash flow model is created projecting cash flows from operations of the business reporting unit  the results of which are weighted 
for the community banking reporting unit a market multiple model utilizes price to net income and price to tangible book value inputs for closed transactions and for certain common sized institutions and the results are weighted 
for the insurance services reporting unit the market multiple model primarily utilizes price to sales for closed transactions and certain similar industry public companies and the results are weighted 
the end results for both reporting units are then compared to the respective book values to consider if impairment is evident 
to determine the overall reasonableness of the reporting unit computations  the combined computed fair value is then compared to the overall market capitalization of the consolidated company to determine the level of implied control premium 
the discounted cash flow analysis uses estimates in the form of growth and attrition rates  anticipated rates of return  and discount rates 
these estimates have a direct bearing on the results of the impairment testing and serve as the basis for management s conclusions as to potential impairment 
the results of the step analysis performed during the fourth quarter of determined that no impairment was evident for either reporting unit 

table of contents income taxes the establishment of provisions for federal and state income taxes is a complex area of accounting which also involves the use of judgments and estimates in applying relevant tax statutes 
the company operates in multiple state tax jurisdictions and this requires the appropriate allocation of income and expense to each state based on a variety of apportionment or allocation bases 
the company is also subject to audit by federal and state tax authorities 
results of these audits may produce indicated liabilities which differ from company estimates and provisions 
the company continually evaluates its exposure to possible tax assessments arising from audits and records its estimate of possible exposure based on current facts and circumstances 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differing carrying values of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement purposes that will reverse in future periods 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
when uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of a deferred tax asset  the carrying value of the asset may be reduced by a valuation allowance 
the amount of any valuation allowance established is based upon an estimate of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be recovered 
increases or decreases in the valuation allowance result in increases or decreases to the provision for income taxes 
recent acquisitions and divestitures on june   the company entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with loss share arrangements with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to purchase certain assets and assume substantially all of the customer deposits and certain liabilities of waccamaw bank waccamaw 
waccamaw  a full service community bank headquartered in whiteville  north carolina  operated sixteen branches throughout north and south carolina 
at acquisition  waccamaw had total assets of approximately million  loans of approximately million  and deposits of approximately million 
as a result of the acquisition and the preliminary purchase price allocation  approximately million was recorded as goodwill  which represents the excess of the value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired including indentified intangibles 
under the single family shared loss agreement and the commercial shared loss agreement with the fdic  the fdic has agreed to cover of most loan and foreclosed real estate losses 
all assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition 
these fair value estimates are considered preliminary  and are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information relative to closing date fair values may become available 
after the initial acquisition  the company agreed to purchase four properties totalling million from the fdic 
on may   the company completed the acquisition of peoples bank of virginia peoples  based in richmond  virginia 
peoples  a full service community bank  operated four branches throughout the richmond area 
at acquisition  peoples had total assets of approximately million  loans of approximately million  and deposits of approximately million 
under the terms of the merger agreement  shares of peoples were exchanged for in cash and shares of the company s common stock  resulting in a purchase price of approximately million 
as a result of the acquisition and the preliminary purchase price allocation  approximately million was recorded as goodwill  which represents the excess of the value of the consideration transferred over the fair market value of the net assets acquired including indentified intangibles 
these fair value estimates are considered preliminary  and are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information relative to closing date fair values may become available

for purposes of this discussion  net interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
the tax equivalent basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
although this is a non gaap measure  management believes this measure is more widely used within the financial services industry and provides better comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
we use this measure to monitor net interest income performance and to manage its balance sheet composition see the table titled average balance sheets and net interest income analysis 
average earning assets increased million and average interest bearing liabilities increased million during  as compared to the prior year 
the yield on average earning assets increased basis points to during from at year end the rate on average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to during from at year end average balances and interest yield rate changes for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities resulted in a net interest rate spread that was basis points higher for year end compared with the same period of our net interest margin increased basis points for year end  compared with the same period of the tax equivalent yield on loans increased basis points for the year ended december   compared with the same period of tax equivalent loan interest income increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared with the same period of the increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to the peoples and waccamaw acquisitions 
the company expects that the effects of the interest accretion will be significantly lessened in future periods 
the tax equivalent yield on available for sale securities decreased basis points for the year ended december   compared with the same period of the decrease was largely due to the new investment and reinvestment of proceeds from sales  maturities  prepayments  and cash in lower yielding securities 
the average balance of held to maturity securities continued to decline as securities were called or matured and were not replaced 
the tax equivalent yield on interest bearing deposits with banks increased basis points for the year ended december   compared with the same period of interest bearing deposits with banks are comprised primarily of excess liquidity kept at the federal reserve that bears overnight market rates

these increases were partially offset by a decreases in advertising expenses of thousand 
these increases were also offset by a million decrease in expenses and losses associated with other real estate owned oreo to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  we use an efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations 
management believes this ratio better focuses attention on the core operating performance of the company over time than does a gaap based ratio  and is highly useful in comparing period to period operating performance of the company s core business operations 
it is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing noninterest expenses 
however  this measure is supplemental and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on gaap measures 
our efficiency may not be comparable to efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions 
in general  our efficiency ratio is noninterest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus noninterest income 
noninterest expenses used in the calculation exclude nonrecurring expenses 
income for the ratio is increased for the favorable effect of tax exempt income see average balance sheets and net interest income analysis and excludes securities gains and losses  which vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses  nonrecurring gains and losses  and otti charges 
the measure is different from the gaap based efficiency ratio that is calculated using noninterest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the consolidated statements of income 
both types of efficiency ratio calculations are set forth and are reconciled in the table below

our most significant permanent differences include income on municipal securities  which are exempt from federal income tax  certain dividend payments  which are deductible  and increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies 
consolidated income taxes were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of the effective tax expense rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management deems sufficient to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by charges to earnings in the form of provisions for loan losses and recoveries of prior loan charge offs and decreased by loans charged off 
the determination of the allowance requires management to make various assumptions and judgments 
as a result  actual loan losses may differ materially from management s determination if actual conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized 
the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control including  among other things  the economy  changes in interest rates  and the view of regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
management considers the allowance to be adequate based upon analysis of the portfolio as of december   however  no assurance can be made that additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
qualitative risk factors for the loan portfolio remain relatively high which reflect the elevated risk of loan losses due to high unemployment  effects of the recent recession  and devaluations of various categories of collateral 
significant stress continues in commercial and residential real estate markets  resulting in significant declines in real estate valuations 
decreases in real estate values adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for 
table of contents loans  including loans we originated 
in addition  adverse changes in the economy  particularly continued high rates of unemployment  may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely loan payments 
a further increase in loan delinquencies could adversely impact loan loss experience  causing potential increases in the provision and allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses for non covered loans was reduced thousand to million at december   compared to million at december  the allowance for loan losses for non covered loans as a percentage of non covered loans held for investment was at december   compared with at december  the decrease between year end and was largely due to the addition of peoples loans at fair value with no corresponding allowance for loan losses 
the portfolio will continue to be monitored for possible deterioration in credit  which may result in the need to record an allowance for loan losses in a future period 
as a result of stable credit metrics and the general downward trend in net charge offs over recent quarters  management deemed the reduced allowance and provision for loan losses as adequate and directionally consistent 
further  a trend of generally improving charge off ratios reduced the quantitative estimate of probable losses in the allowance for loan loss methodology

certain loans included in the nonaccrual category have been written down to the estimated realizable value or assigned specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses based upon management s estimate of loss at ultimate resolution 
when restructuring loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty  we generally make concessions in interest rates  loan terms and or amortization terms

as a result of the elevated levels of charge offs and in light of the broader economy  we deemed it appropriate to maintain an elevated level of qualitative factors that adjust upward the historical loss rates in its allowance model 
we maintain an active and robust problem credit identification system 
when a credit is identified as exhibiting characteristics of weakening  we will assess the credit for potential impairment 
examples of weakening include delinquency and deterioration of the borrower s capacity to repay as determined by our ongoing credit review function 
as part of the impairment review  we evaluate the current collateral value 
it is our standard practice to obtain updated third party collateral valuations to assist management in measuring potential impairment of a credit and the amount of the impairment to be recorded  if any 
internal collateral valuations are generally performed within two to four weeks of the original identification of potential impairment and receipt of the third party valuation 
the internal valuation is performed by comparing the original appraisal to current local real estate market conditions and experience and considers expected liquidation costs 
the result of the internal valuation is compared to the outstanding loan balance  and  if warranted  a specific impairment reserve will be established at the completion of the internal evaluation 
a third party evaluation is typically received within thirty to forty five days of the completion of the internal evaluation 
once received  the third party evaluation is reviewed for reasonableness 
once the evaluation is reviewed and accepted  discounts to fair market value are applied based upon such factors as the bank s historical liquidation experience of like collateral  and an estimated net realizable value is established 
that estimated net realizable value is then compared to the outstanding loan balance to determine the amount of specific impairment reserve 
the specific impairment reserve  if necessary  is adjusted to reflect the results of the updated evaluation 
a specific impairment reserve is generally maintained on impaired loans during the period while awaiting receipt of the third party evaluation  as well as on impaired loans that continue to make some form of payment where liquidation is not imminent 
impaired loans not meeting the aforementioned criteria and that do not have a specific impairment reserve typically have been previously written down through a partial charge off to their net realizable value 
our special assets staff assumes the management and monitoring of all loans determined to be impaired 
while awaiting the completion of the third party appraisal  we generally begin to complete the tasks necessary to gain control of the collateral and prepare for liquidation  including  but not limited to engagement of counsel  inspection of collateral  and continued communication with the borrower  if appropriate 
special assets staff also regularly reviews the relationship to identify any potential adverse developments during this time 
generally  the only difference between current appraised value  adjusted for liquidation costs  and the carrying amount of the loan less the specific reserve is any downward adjustment to the appraised value that our special assets staff determines appropriate 
these differences generally consist of costs to sell the property  as well as a deflator for the devaluation of property when banks are the sellers  and management deems these fair value adjustments 
based on prior experience  the bank does not generally return loans to performing status after the loans have been partially charged off

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on 
table of contents interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that interest earning assets reprice differently than interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds while maintaining an acceptable level of net interest income given the current interest rate environment 
the company s primary component of operational revenue  net interest income  is subject to variation as a result of changes in interest rate environments in conjunction with unbalanced repricing opportunities on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk has four primary components repricing risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and option risk 
repricing risk occurs when earning assets and paying liabilities reprice at differing times as interest rates change 
basis risk occurs when the underlying rates on the assets and liabilities the institution holds change at different levels or in varying degrees 
yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences as a result of unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
lastly  option risk is due to embedded options  often put or call options  given or sold to holders of financial instruments 
in order to mitigate the effect of changes in the general level of interest rates  the company manages repricing opportunities and thus  its interest rate sensitivity 
the company seeks to control its interest rate risk exposure to insulate net interest income and net earnings from fluctuations in the general level of interest rates 
to measure its exposure to interest rate risk  quarterly simulations of net interest income are performed using financial models that project net interest income through a range of possible interest rate environments including rising  declining  most likely and flat rate scenarios 
the simulation model used by the company captures all earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments and combines the various factors affecting rate sensitivity into an earnings outlook and estimates of the economic value of equity for a range of assumed interest rate scenarios 
the results of these simulations indicate the existence and severity of interest rate risk in each of those rate environments based upon the current balance sheet position  assumptions as to changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities and the company s estimate of yields to be attained in those future rate environments and rates that will be paid on various deposit instruments and borrowings 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and the company s strategies 
however  the earnings simulation model is currently the best tool available to the company and the industry for managing interest rate risk 
the company has established policy limits for tolerance of interest rate risk in various interest rate scenarios 
in addition  the policy addresses exposure limits to changes in the economic value of equity according to predefined policy guidelines 
the most recent simulation indicates that current exposure to interest rate risk is within the company s defined policy limits 
the following table summarizes the impact of immediate and sustained rate shocks in the interest rate environment on net interest income 
the model simulates plus to minus basis point changes from the base case rate simulation and illustrates the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes over a twelve month time period 
this modeling technique  although useful  does not take into account all strategies that management might undertake in response to a sudden and sustained rate shock as depicted 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
as of september   the federal open market committee maintained a target range for federal funds of to basis points  rendering a complete downward shock of basis points meaningless  accordingly  
table of contents downward rate scenarios are limited to minus basis points 
in the downward rate shocks presented  benchmark interest rates are assumed at levels with floors near 
december  december  amounts in thousands increase decrease in interest rates basis points change in net interest income percent change change in net interest income percent change during the next twelve months we have more assets than liabilities projected to reprice 
as a result  projected net interest income will increase if and when benchmark rates increase 
if benchmark interest rates decrease further than current levels  projected net interest income will remain roughly level 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
in management s opinion  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s consolidated performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services
