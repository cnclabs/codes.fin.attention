item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for purposes of reviewing this document  segment profit is calculated as revenue less cost of revenue and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests excluding corporate general and administrative expense  interest expense  interest income  domestic and foreign income taxes  and other non operating income and expense items 
for a reconciliation of segment profit to earnings before taxes  see operations by business segment and geographical area in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations summary of overall company results consolidated revenue for increased percent to billion from billion for  primarily due to substantial growth in the mining and metals business line of the industrial infrastructure segment and growth in the oil gas segment 
revenue in the global services and power segments also increased in compared to the prior year 
consolidated revenue for increased percent to billion from billion for  principally due to substantial growth in the mining and metals business line of the industrial infrastructure segment  as well as revenue growth in the oil gas  government and global services segments 
this revenue growth was partially offset by the significant revenue decline in the power segment in earnings before taxes for decreased percent to million from billion in  due to lower contributions from the industrial infrastructure segment which recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to an unexpected adverse decision from the arbitration proceedings on the greater gabbard offshore wind farm greater gabbard project  a billion lump sum project to provide engineering  procurement and construction services for the client offshore wind farm project in the united kingdom 
see industrial infrastructure below and contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the greater gabbard project 
improved contributions in the oil gas  global services and government segments during were offset by lower earnings in the power segment 
earnings before taxes for increased percent to billion from million in earnings for the period increased primarily due to a reduced level of project charges compared to during 
table of contents  the company recorded significant charges for two infrastructure projects 
first  for the greater gabbard project  charges totaling million were taken in for estimated cost overruns for a variety of execution challenges that impacted the schedule and project cost forecast  including material and equipment delivery issues  productivity issues  the bankruptcy of a major subcontractor and weather related delays 
second  the company recorded a charge of million during after an adverse bankruptcy court ruling on the priority of claims made by its joint venture against a bankrupt client entity for a completed million fixed price infrastructure joint venture project near san diego  california 
during  the company recorded additional charges for the greater gabbard project totaling million  primarily due to increased costs associated with the installation of subsea cable and schedule delays related to adverse weather conditions 
however  the results were positively impacted by improved performance in the mining and metals business line of the industrial infrastructure segment and the global services segment  offset somewhat by lower earnings in the power and oil gas segments 
a highly competitive business environment has continued to put increased pressure on margins 
this competitive environment is expected to continue and  in certain cases  may result in more lump sum project execution for the company 
in some instances  margins are being negatively impacted by the change in the mix of work performed eg  a higher mix of construction related work and a higher content of customer furnished materials  which typically generate lower margins than engineering work or projects without customer furnished materials 
the mining and metals business line of the industrial infrastructure segment has grown rapidly over the last four years  but has shown recent signs of slowing down 
it is possible that the weakened mining market conditions could be protracted 
the effective tax rate was percent  percent and percent for  and  respectively 
the rate was favorably impacted by the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits of million related to a settlement with the irs for tax years through  as well as the net reduction of tax reserves totaling million attributable to a variety of domestic and international disputed items  including the resolution of an uncertainty associated with a prior year tax restructuring 
the rate was favorably impacted by the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of various disputed items 
the lower rate was primarily attributable to a million tax benefit that resulted from a worthless stock deduction for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter  partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance associated with net operating losses 
factors affecting the effective tax rates for are discussed further under corporate  tax and other matters below 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation were per diluted share in compared to and per diluted share in and  respectively 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in reflected the pre tax charge of million per diluted share for the greater gabbard project noted above 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in also included a pre tax gain of million per diluted share on the sale of the company unconsolidated interest in a telecommunications company located in the united kingdom 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in reflected the pre tax charges of million per diluted share for the greater gabbard project 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in included the negative impact of the following pre tax charges million per diluted share for the greater gabbard project  million per diluted share for a completed infrastructure joint venture project in california  and million per diluted share for a gas fired power project in georgia 
net earnings attributable to fluor corporation in also included the million per diluted share tax benefit described above for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary 
a significant portion of this tax benefit resulted from the financial impact of the greater gabbard project charges on the foreign subsidiary 
consolidated new awards for were billion compared to billion in and billion in the major contributors of new award activity for all three years were the oil gas and industrial infrastructure segments 
approximately percent of consolidated new awards for were for projects located outside of the united states 

table of contents consolidated backlog was billion as of december   billion as of december  and billion as of december  the oil gas and industrial infrastructure segments made up the vast majority of backlog for all three years and drove the increase in backlog in and compared to as of december   approximately percent of consolidated backlog related to projects located outside of the united states 
for a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment  corporate general and administrative expense and other items  see segment operations and corporate  tax and other matters below 
discussion of critical accounting policies the company discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply to the following critical accounting policies engineering and construction contracts contract revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost 
contracts are generally segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  and accordingly  gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered 
the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of cost to complete for contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor cost and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract cost and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
pre contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the majority of the company engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of cost plus a fixed or percentage fee 
as of december   percent of the company backlog was cost reimbursable while percent was for fixed price  lump sum or guaranteed maximum contracts 
in certain instances  the company provides guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees could result in unrealized incentive fees or liquidated damages 
in addition  increases in contract cost can result in non recoverable cost which could exceed revenue realized from the projects 
claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made claims against clients for cost incurred in excess of current contract provisions 
the company recognizes revenue  but not profit  for certain significant claims when it is determined that recovery of incurred cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated 
under asc  these requirements are satisfied when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company performance  claim related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed  and evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
cost  but not profit  associated with unapproved change orders is accounted for in revenue when it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable  but the revenue cannot be reliably estimated  cost attributable to change orders is deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 
if the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met  revenue is recorded only to the extent that costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred 
recognized 
table of contents claims against clients amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
claim revenue of million for the greater gabbard project was reversed in the fourth quarter of when the company no longer believed the recovery of its incurred cost was probable  as a result of the unexpected adverse arbitration ruling 
backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  revisions to project scope and cost  and deferrals  as appropriate 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures certain contracts are executed jointly through partnership and joint venture arrangements with unrelated third parties 
generally  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership interest that requires only a small initial investment 
the arrangements are often formed for the single business purpose of executing a specific project and allow the company to share risks and or secure specialty skills required for project execution 
the company evaluates each partnership and joint venture at inception to determine if it qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under asc a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors who are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the majority of the company partnerships and joint ventures qualify as vies because the total equity investment is typically nominal and not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
upon the occurrence of certain events outlined in asc  the company reassesses its initial determination of whether the partnership or joint venture is a vie 
the company also evaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary of each vie and consolidates the vie if the company has both a the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and b the obligation to absorb losses of  or the right to receive benefits from  the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the company considers the contractual agreements that define the ownership structure  distribution of profits and losses  risks  responsibilities  indebtedness  voting rights and board representation of the respective parties in determining whether it qualifies as the primary beneficiary 
the company also considers all parties that have direct or implicit variable interests when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary 
in most cases  the company does not qualify as the primary beneficiary 
when the company is determined to be the primary beneficiary  the vie is consolidated 
as required by asc  management assessment of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie is continuously performed 
for partnerships and joint ventures in the construction industry  unless full consolidation is required  the company generally recognizes its proportionate share of revenue  cost and profit in its consolidated statement of earnings and uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet  as allowed under asc at times  the cost and equity methods of accounting are also used  depending on the company respective ownership interest  amount of influence in the vie and other factors 
the most significant application of the proportionate consolidation method is in the oil gas  industrial infrastructure and government segments 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests 
interim testing for impairment is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist 
for purposes of impairment testing  goodwill is allocated to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure 
when testing goodwill for impairment  the company first compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment 
in the second step  the company compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized 
during  the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests in the first quarter and determined that none of the goodwill was impaired because the fair value of 
table of contents each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying amount 
the company also performed an interim goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of for the industrial infrastructure segment after the greater gabbard project charge and quantitatively determined that none of the segment goodwill was impaired 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
interim testing for impairment is performed if indicators of potential impairment exist 
an intangible asset with an indefinite life is impaired if its carrying value exceeds its fair value 
as of december   none of the company intangible assets with indefinite lives were impaired 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over the useful lives of those assets  ranging from one year to ten years 
deferred taxes and tax contingencies deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company financial statements or tax returns 
as of december   the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
the allowance for primarily relates to the deferred tax assets on certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries and certain reserves on investments 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company effective tax rate on future earnings 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
the company recognizes potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense 
retirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with asc  defined benefit plans pension 
as required by asc  the unfunded or overfunded projected benefit obligation is recognized in the company financial statements 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund between million and million for the calendar year  which is expected to be in excess of the minimum funding required 
if the discount rates were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities for the us and us plans would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
segment operations the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction  maintenance and project management 
the company is organized into five principal business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
for more information on the business segments see item business above 

table of contents oil gas revenue and segment profit for the oil gas segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue for increased nearly percent compared to the prior year as a result of higher project execution activities for several projects in the segment  including a coal bed methane gas project in australia  a grassroots petrochemical complex in the middle east and a major mine replacement project in canada 
revenue in increased three percent compared to primarily because of increased construction related activities  including a greater content of customer furnished materials for projects that were awarded in segment profit in increased percent compared to and was driven by the higher project execution activities associated with the current year revenue increase  including higher contributions from the coal bed methane gas project in australia  as well as numerous other projects in various geographic regions 
segment profit in decreased percent compared to primarily because the results were favorably impacted by contributions of certain large projects that were completed or nearing completion  as well as various other projects that achieved their peak earnings that year 
in addition  segment profit was favorably impacted by the successful resolution of some disputed items and the expiration of certain warranty obligations 
segment profit margin was percent in both and  compared to percent in the reduction in segment profit margin in the two more recent years compared to was primarily due to a shift in the mix of work from higher margin engineering activities to lower margin construction activities 
the successful resolution of some disputed items and the expiration of certain warranty obligations in also contributed to the higher segment profit margin in  relative to and new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  billion in and billion in new awards in included an oil sands bitumen processing facility in canada  a gas processing project in kazakhstan and a petrochemicals complex in the united states 
new awards in included a petrochemicals complex in the middle east and upstream services associated with an oil sands bitumen processing facility in canada 
backlog for the oil gas segment was billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  and billion as of december  although market conditions remain very competitive  the increase in backlog reflects the improvement in the segment markets  particularly the increasing worldwide demand for new capacity in oil and gas production  including pipelines  refining and petrochemicals 
total assets in the segment increased to billion as of december  from billion as of december  due to higher levels of working capital being needed to support project execution activities 
table of contents industrial infrastructure revenue and segment profit loss for the industrial infrastructure segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit loss revenue in increased percent compared to  and revenue in increased percent from  primarily due to substantial growth in the mining and metals business line 
segment profit and segment profit margin decreased significantly in compared to as a result of a million pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of due to an unexpected adverse decision in the arbitration proceedings related to the company claims for additional compensation on the greater gabbard project 
the greater gabbard project charges were somewhat offset by the favorable impact on segment profit of the substantially higher level of project execution activities related to the growth in the mining and metals business line  noted above  and a pre tax gain of million on the october sale of the company unconsolidated interest in a telecommunications company located in the united kingdom that was formed in connection with the development and construction of a previously completed project 
segment profit for also included positive contributions from various infrastructure projects  including million due to the achievement of significant progress milestones on one project  million as an infrastructure road project neared completion  and million for fees earned at financial closing for another infrastructure road project 
during  the segment recorded charges totaling million for the greater gabbard project due to increased costs associated with project execution activities 
these charges were largely offset by positive contributions from other projects in the segment during the year  including million for forecast adjustments due to the achievement of progress milestones on two infrastructure road projects  million from the closeout of an infrastructure project  million of costs recovered in a settlement with a bankrupt client for a fixed price infrastructure joint venture project discussed in more detail below  and million related to the favorable resolution of certain disputed items and the achievement of incentive targets on a mining project 
segment profit and segment profit margin increased substantially in compared to primarily because the earlier period included the impact of significant charges for the greater gabbard project and another infrastructure project 
for the greater gabbard project  charges totaling million were taken in for estimated cost overruns for a variety of execution challenges that impacted the schedule and project cost forecast  including material and equipment delivery issues  productivity issues  the bankruptcy of a major subcontractor and weather related delays 
in addition  the segment recorded a charge of million during after an adverse bankruptcy court ruling on the priority of claims made by its joint venture against a bankrupt client entity for a completed million fixed price infrastructure joint venture project in california 
as a result of the ruling  the company determined that the likelihood of recovering cost overruns resulting from owner directed scope changes was no longer considered probable 
as noted in the preceding paragraph  the segment recorded charges of million for greater gabbard in that were offset by positive contributions from various projects 
segment profit in was also favorably impacted by a significantly higher level of project execution activities associated with the growth in the mining and metals business line relative to the charges for the two infrastructure projects were offset somewhat by positive contributions from other projects in the segment during the year  which included solid overall contributions from the mining and metals business line  as well as million of fees earned at financial closing for an infrastructure rail project  million for the final negotiated settlement and closeout of both an infrastructure road project and an infrastructure telecommunications project  and million for the approval of a significant change order for another infrastructure road project 

table of contents the company is involved in a dispute in connection with the substantially completed greater gabbard project 
as noted above  in the fourth quarter of  the company received an unexpected adverse decision in the arbitration proceedings related to the company claims for additional compensation on the project 
the claim related to delays in the fabrication of monopiles and transition pieces  along with certain disruption and productivity issues associated with construction activities and weather related delays that the company believed would be recovered in arbitration due to the company belief the schedule and cost impacts were attributable to the client and other third parties 
as noted above  and as a result of the adverse decision  the company recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of the charge was primarily comprised of the reversal of claim revenue of million that had been recorded in prior periods for costs incurred when the company believed the recovery of such costs was probable under asc  and a significant portion of the million contractual maximum of liquidated damages that the client had previously withheld and the company believed were recoverable  as well as additional costs expected to be incurred through close out of the project 
the client has filed a counterclaim against the company seeking to recover approximately million for past and future costs associated with  among other things  monitoring certain monopiles and transition pieces for alleged defects 
the counterclaim is currently scheduled for hearing in april while the ultimate outcome of the hearing is uncertain  the company believes that the monopiles and transition pieces meet applicable performance requirements and therefore does not believe that a loss associated with the counterclaim is probable 
as a result  the company has not recorded a charge under asc to the extent the client counterclaim is successful  there could be a substantial charge to earnings 
see contingencies and commitments below in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the legal proceedings related to the greater gabbard project 
new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment were billion during  billion during  and billion during new awards in were primarily attributable to the mining and metals business line 
the lower new award activity in was attributable to the deferral of major capital investment decisions by some mining customers due to project cost escalation  softening commodity demand and project specific circumstances 
the timing of when capital investment by these mining customers could resume is uncertain 
however  it is possible that the weakened mining market conditions could be prolonged 
new award activity in and was also primarily attributable to the mining and metals business line  with significant contributions from the infrastructure business line in the new awards in included billion for ongoing iron ore work in australia  as well as a major copper project in peru 
the new awards in included an aluminum program in saudi arabia valued at billion  a billion copper mine in chile and billion for an infrastructure rail project in the united states 
ending backlog for the segment decreased to billion for from billion for and billion for the decline in backlog was due to the reduced new award volume in the mining and metals business line during the year  discussed above  and cancellations of two mining projects during the third quarter of totaling billion 
the growth in backlog in was due to the substantial new award activity in both and total assets in the industrial infrastructure segment were million as of december  compared to million as of december  this decrease was due to the removal of amounts from work in process related to the fourth quarter charge for the greater gabbard project 

table of contents government revenue and segment profit for the government segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue in decreased slightly compared to  primarily due to the close out of the american recovery and reinvestment act arra funded work at the savannah river site management and operating project the savannah river project in south carolina 
revenue in increased percent compared to  principally due to an increase in the volume of work for the logistics civil augmentation program logcap iv for the united states army in afghanistan 
project execution activities associated with the gaseous diffusion plant contract for the department of energy in portsmouth  ohio the portsmouth project  awarded in the first quarter of  also contributed to the revenue increase  though the impact was largely offset by a reduction in revenue attributable to the winding down of the arra funded work at the savannah river project and the completion of many task orders for the us army corps of engineers transatlantic programs center cetac logistics program in iraq 
segment profit during and increased three percent and two percent compared to and  respectively 
the modest improvement in segment profit in was primarily due to additional contributions from project execution activities on logcap iv task orders  which more than offset charges totaling million related to an adverse judgment in the first quarter of associated with the company claim on an embassy project  discussed below in contingencies and commitments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
an agreement has been reached to change the logcap iv award fee to a fixed fee and address other open contract issues 
as a result of this agreement  the company recognized additional segment profit of million in the fourth quarter of  which largely offset the impact of an unexpected lower award fee for logcap iv in the third quarter of the slight growth in segment profit for was mostly attributable to increased volume on logcap iv task orders 
the portsmouth project also contributed to the growth in segment profit  though reduced contributions from both cetac task orders and work at the savannah river project more than offset its positive impact 
segment profit margin was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
new awards were billion during  billion during and billion during the decrease in was primarily due to a reduction in logcap iv new award activity that corresponded to lower volume and the timing of incremental task order awards  as well as less funding for the portsmouth project for which  as the initial year of the contract  included amounts for both a transition period and the project annual funding 
the increase in new award activity in was primarily attributable to the initial contract funding for the portsmouth project and increased funding for logcap iv task orders 
new awards in and also included the annual funding for the savannah river project 
the company reports new awards for logcap iv as individual task orders are awarded and funded 
backlog was million as of december   billion as of december  and million as of december  the decline in backlog in was attributable to the reduced new award activity for logcap iv and the work off of backlog for the arra funded work at the savannah river project 
the growth in backlog during was driven by the initial contract funding for the portsmouth project and increased funding for logcap iv task orders 
total assets in the government segment were million as of december  and million as of december  
table of contents global services revenue and segment profit for the global services segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit revenue in increased nine percent compared to  primarily due to the equipment business line increased volume of activity in south america  mexico and canada 
the operations and maintenance  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines also contributed to the revenue increase 
revenue in increased five percent compared to  principally due to the equipment business line which experienced a higher volume of work in afghanistan and south america 
a decrease in revenue attributable to the close out of the gulf coast oil spill cleanup project in was offset by an increase in other operations and maintenance business line project execution activities and an increase in revenue in the temporary staffing business line 
segment profit during increased percent compared to  primarily due to contributions from the operations and maintenance business line which experienced higher contributions from various domestic and international projects 
the temporary staffing business line also contributed to the increase in segment profit due to improvement in its north american and european operations 
segment profit during increased percent compared to  primarily due to the improved performance from the equipment business line  as noted above 
increased segment profit in from the temporary staffing business line was offset by a decrease in contributions from the operations and maintenance business line  the latter of which was primarily the result of the close out of the gulf coast oil spill cleanup project in segment profit margin was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and  respectively 
segment profit margin for was higher compared to due to improvement in margins from the operations and maintenance business line 
segment profit margin for was higher compared to due to improvement in margins in the equipment business line activities in afghanistan and south america 
new awards in the global services segment were million during  billion during and billion during the operations and maintenance business line continues to experience reduced renewal agreements with existing clients  as well as delayed new client releases 
backlog for the global services segment was billion as of december   billion as of december  and billion as of december  operations and maintenance activities that have yet to be performed comprise global services backlog 
short duration operations and maintenance activities may not contribute to ending backlog 
the equipment  temporary staffing and supply chain solutions business lines do not report backlog or new awards 
total assets in the global services segment were million as of december  and million as of december  
table of contents power revenue and segment profit loss for the power segment are summarized as follows year ended december  in millions revenue segment profit loss revenue in was percent higher compared to  primarily attributable to projects awarded in and  including a new gas fired power plant project in texas and new solar power projects in arizona and california 
the prior year period included project execution activities for several projects which have since been completed  including gas fired power plants in texas  virginia and georgia 
revenue in decreased percent compared to  primarily due to the expected reduction in project execution activities on several projects which had reached or were near final completion  including the oak grove coal fired power project in texas for luminant  a unit of energy future holdings corporation  gas fired power plants in texas and virginia  and pre construction services on a nuclear new build project in texas  as well as reduced volume on certain other projects progressing toward completion 
segment profit and segment profit margin for declined significantly compared to  principally due to reduced contributions from several completed projects  including the gas fired power plants in texas and virginia  and expenses associated with the company continued investment in nuscale  a small modular nuclear reactor technology company  in which the company acquired a majority interest in late the nuscale expenses for and were million and million  respectively 
the operations of nuscale are primarily for research and development activities 
although part of the power segment  these activities could provide future benefits to both commercial and government clients 
power segment profit during decreased percent compared to principally due to reduced contributions from the oak grove project 
the reduced contributions from other projects nearing completion  including the gas fired power plant project in texas  pre construction services on the nuclear new build project in texas and an emissions control retrofit project in south carolina  were offset by lower charges taken for cost overruns on a gas fired power plant project in georgia million during compared to million in and improved performance on the gas fired power plant project in virginia due to the achievement of major milestones 
segment profit margin in the power segment was percent and percent for and  respectively  and are explained by the factors noted above that impacted revenue and segment profit for those years 
the power segment continues to be impacted by relatively weak demand for new power generation 
market segments that are best suited to yield new near term opportunities include gas fired combined cycle generation  renewable energy  regional transmission feasibility additions and air emissions compliance projects for existing coal fired power plants 
new awards of million in included a new solar power project in california 
new awards of billion in included an air emissions control construction program for luminant  a new gas fired power plant project in texas  and a new solar power project in arizona 
new awards of million in included work for nuclear preconstruction services and the renewal of the luminant system wide fossil maintenance program in texas 
backlog was billion as of december   billion as of december  and million as of december  the increase in backlog in was principally driven by the new awards mentioned in the preceding paragraph which were awarded in the latter part of the year 
total assets in the power segment were million as of december  and million as of december  the decrease in the segment total assets in was attributed to a reduction in project working capital 

table of contents corporate  tax and other matters corporate for the three years ended december   and  corporate general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
the eight percent reduction in corporate general and administrative expenses compared to was the net result of many factors  including lower executive bonuses and reduced foreign currency losses in the current year 
the five percent increase in corporate general and administrative expenses compared to was primarily the result of higher management incentive compensation and foreign currency losses  offset somewhat by overhead reduction efforts and other factors 
net interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to net interest income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense was considerably higher in due to the million of senior notes that were issued in september the increase in net interest income in was due to higher cash balances in certain international locations that earn higher yields  offset partially by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of the senior notes discussed above 
tax the effective tax rate on the company pretax earnings was percent  percent and percent for the years  and  respectively 
the rate was favorably impacted by the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits of million related to a settlement with the irs for tax years through  as well as the net reduction of tax reserves totaling million attributable to a variety of domestic and international disputed items  including the resolution of an uncertainty associated with a prior year tax restructuring 
the rate was favorably impacted by the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of various disputed items 
the lower rate was primarily attributable to a million tax benefit that resulted from a worthless stock deduction for the tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary in the fourth quarter  partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance associated with net operating losses 
a significant portion of the million tax benefit resulted from the financial impact of the greater gabbard project charges on the foreign subsidiary 
litigation and matters in dispute resolution see contingencies and commitments below in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and financial condition liquidity is provided by available cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  credit facilities and access to financial markets 
the company has committed and uncommitted lines of credit totaling billion  which may be used for revolving loans  letters of credit and or general purposes 
the company believes that for at least the next months  cash generated from operations  along with its unused credit capacity of billion and substantial cash position  is sufficient to support operating requirements 
however  the company regularly reviews its sources and uses of liquidity and may pursue opportunities to increase its liquidity positions 
the company conservative financial strategy and consistent performance have earned it strong credit ratings  resulting in continued access to the capital markets 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all its covenants related to its debt agreements 
the company total debt to total capitalization debt to capital ratio as of december  was percent compared to percent as of december  cash flows cash and cash equivalents were billion as of both december  and cash and cash equivalents combined with current and noncurrent marketable securities were billion as of december  compared to billion as of december  cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous accounts throughout the world to fund the company global project execution activities 
as of december  and  cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states amounted to billion and billion  respectively 
the company did not consider any cash to be permanently

additionally  certain projects receive advance payments from clients 
a normal trend for these projects is to have higher cash balances during the initial phases of execution which then level out toward the end of the construction phase 
as a result  the company cash position is reduced as customer advances are worked off  unless they are replaced by advances on other projects 
the company maintains cash reserves and borrowing facilities to satisfy any net operating cash outflows in the event there is an investment in operating assets that exceeds the projects available cash balances

guarantees  inflation and variable interest entities guarantees in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into various agreements providing performance assurances and guarantees to clients on behalf of certain consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships  joint ventures and other jointly executed contracts 
these agreements are entered into primarily to support the project execution commitments of these entities 
the performance guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from mechanical completion of the facilities being constructed to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances 
the maximum potential payment amount of an outstanding performance guarantee is the remaining cost of work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts 
amounts that may be required to be paid in excess of estimated cost to complete contracts in progress are not estimable 
for cost reimbursable contracts  amounts that may become payable pursuant to guarantee provisions are normally recoverable from the client for work performed under the contract 
for lump sum or fixed price contracts  the performance guarantee amount is the cost to complete the contracted work less amounts remaining to be billed to the client under the contract 
remaining billable amounts could be greater or less than the cost to complete 
in those cases where costs exceed the remaining amounts payable under the contract  the company may have recourse to third parties  such as owners  co venturers  subcontractors or vendors for claims

operating leases are primarily for engineering and project execution office facilities in sugar land  texas  the united kingdom and various other u 
s and international locations  equipment used in connection with long term construction contracts and other personal property 
uncertain tax contingencies are positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities 
the total amount of uncertain tax contingencies is included in the over years column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments 
if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary 
the company generally provides funding to its us and us pension plans to at least the minimum required by applicable regulations 
in determining the minimum required funding  the company utilizes current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and marketable securities are deposited with major banks throughout the world

marketable securities consist of time deposits  registered money market funds  us agency securities  us treasury securities  
table of contents commercial paper  international government securities and corporate debt securities 
the company has not incurred any credit risk losses related to deposits in cash and marketable securities 
the company limits exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in currencies corresponding to the currency in which cost is incurred 
as a result  the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed 
however  in cases where revenue and expenses are not denominated in the same currency  the company hedges its exposure  if material  as discussed below 
the company utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate certain financial exposure  including currency and commodity price risk associated with engineering and construction contracts  currency risk associated with intercompany transactions and risk associated with interest rate volatility 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
as of december   the company had foreign exchange forward contracts of less than two year duration and a total gross notional amount of million 
as of december   the company had commodity swap forward contracts of less than two years duration and a total gross notional amount of million 
the company historical gains and losses associated with derivative instruments have been immaterial  and have largely mitigated the exposures being hedged 
the company long term debt obligations carry a fixed rate coupon and its exposure to interest rate risk is not material due to the low interest rates on these obligations
