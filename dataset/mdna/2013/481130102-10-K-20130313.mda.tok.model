this discussion contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements for a discussion of uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview our business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance 
our reportable business segments are i broadcasting  ii publishing  and iii corporate 
our broadcasting segment  operating in states  consists of radio stations and television stations 
the television stations include wacy tv in appleton  wisconsin that we purchased on october  and was previously operated under a local marketing agreement lma and wtvf tv in nashville  tennessee that we purchased on december  results from our digital media assets are included in our broadcasting and publishing segments 
our publishing segment consists of the milwaukee journal sentinel  which serves as the only major daily newspaper for the milwaukee metropolitan area  and several community publications primarily in southeastern wisconsin as well as print facilities in milwaukee and waupaca  wisconsin 
our corporate segment consists of unallocated corporate expenses and revenue eliminations 
revenue in the broadcast industry is derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  national  and political and issue advertisers  retransmission fees and  to a lesser extent  from barter  digital revenue and other revenue 
our television and radio stations are attracting new local advertisers through the creation of new local content and programs that combine television or radio with digital 
because television and radio broadcasters rely upon advertising revenue  they are subject to cyclical changes in the economy 
the size of advertisers budgets  which are affected by broad economic trends  affects the radio industry in general and the revenue of individual television stations in particular 
our broadcasting business continues to experience an uneven economic recovery across the markets in which we operate due to continued challenges in employment and the housing markets 
our broadcasting business also is affected by audience fragmentation as audiences have an increasing number of options to access news and other programming 
television advertising revenue and rates in even numbered years typically benefit from political and issue advertising 
as the demand for advertising increases on the limited available inventory  we have the opportunity to increase average unit rates we charge our customers 
even numbered years also benefit from olympics related advertising on our three nbc affiliates 
the increased ratings during the olympic time period  which fell during the third quarter of  provided us the opportunity to sell advertising at premium rates 
over the past several years  fundamentals in the newspaper industry have continued to deteriorate 
retail and classified run of press rop advertising have decreased from historic levels due in part to department store consolidation  weakened employment  automotive and real estate economics and a migration of advertising to the internet and other advertising forms 
however  in the second half of  the daily newspaper experienced year over year growth in retail rop due to special programs and initiatives 
circulation declines and online competition have also negatively impacted newspaper industry revenues 
revenue from our broadcasting businesses increased million in compared to this was primarily due to a million increase in political and issue advertising revenue  a million increase in local advertising revenue  a million increase in national advertising revenue  a million increase in olympic advertising revenue  a million increase in retransmission revenue  and a million increase in other revenue 
the increase in national advertising revenue was driven by the political  media and automotive categories 
the increase in local advertising revenue was driven by the automotive  political  and casino and gambling categories 
total expenses from our broadcasting business increased million  or  in compared to  primarily due to an increase in employee related costs  national sales representatives commission expenses  acquisition and integration related costs  expenses related to the new green bay packers preseason network agreement and increases in network costs 
operating earnings from our broadcasting business increased million in compared to  primarily due to an increase in political and issue and olympic advertising revenue  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
on december   journal broadcast group  our broadcasting business  acquired equity interests in newschannel network  llc which owns the cbs affiliate wtvf tv  in nashville  tennessee 
the total purchase price for the station was million including a working capital adjustment of million 
on october   we completed the purchase of wacy tv for million 
on june   we completed the asset purchase of khtt fm and kbex fm in tulsa  oklahoma for million 
in december  journal community publishing group  inc  our community newspapers and shoppers business  completed the sale of the majority of our northern wisconsin publications 
net proceeds were million plus a note receivable of million  and we recorded a pre tax loss on the sale  net of transaction expenses  of million 
the divestitures allow us to focus our efforts on operating the only major daily newspaper for the milwaukee metropolitan area  our community publications primarily in southeastern wisconsin as well as print facilities in milwaukee and waupaca  wisconsin 

index in  our publishing businesses continued to be impacted by the uneven economic recovery and the secular and cyclical influences affecting the newspaper industry 
we have seen advertisers reduce their spending in many advertising categories 
retail advertising revenue decreased million in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in preprint advertising at the daily newspaper from the department store  telecommunications  and building categories and the sale of the florida based community newspapers and shoppers in  partially offset by the increase in retail rop from special programs and initiatives 
the sale of the florida based community newspapers and shoppers accounted for million of the year over year decline 
classified advertising revenue also decreased in by million compared to the largest declines were in the automotive and employment categories at the daily newspaper  combined with million year over year decline from the sale of the florida based community newspapers and shoppers in publishing digital advertising revenue of million increased  primarily due to increases in retail sponsorships and other revenue  partially offset by declines in classified advertising revenue 
national advertising revenue decreased million in due to a decrease in rop and preprint advertising in the furniture and business services categories 
in the first quarter of  the milwaukee journal sentinel introduced a digital subscription program  or paywall  on our jsonline 
com website 
integrated into the launch of the js everywhere subscription was a price increase to our home delivery subscribers  who gain full access to all digital products  including the new ipad app  mobile phone app and jsonline 
com with their subscription fee 
this contributed to a circulation revenue increase of million in compared to at our daily newspaper  commercial delivery revenue decreased in by million compared to commercial printing revenue at our daily newspaper increased million in compared to  driven by increased volume and one large new customer 
total expenses at our publishing businesses decreased million in compared to  primarily due to expense savings from previous workforce reduction charges 
operating earnings at our publishing businesses decreased million in compared to the decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to the impact of decreased advertising revenue  combined with a million year over year decline from the sale of the florida based community newspapers and shoppers in the second and third quarter of and rising costs relating to workers compensation and pension 
advertising revenue at our broadcasting and publishing businesses reflects continued cautious behavior of both our customers and consumers 
while we are seeing some improvement in advertising spending at our broadcasting business  persistent high unemployment  lack of strong economic growth and continued economic uncertainty temper our optimism 
revenue levels in our broadcasting business will continue to be affected by increased competition for audiences 
we do not expect that revenues at our daily newspaper will return to revenue levels reported in or prior years given the secular changes affecting the newspaper industry 
we continue to seek in market growth opportunities in traditional or digital media  make capital investments in our businesses which we expect to positively impact revenue  and continue to look for new acquisition opportunities within broadcast 
our acquisition strategy will hinge upon our ability to identify strategic candidates  negotiate definitive agreements on acceptable terms and  as necessary  secure additional financing 
the purchases of the two radio stations in tulsa  oklahoma  the nashville cbs affiliate wtvf tv newschannel  and the remaining assets of wacy tv in green bay  wisconsin are consistent with one of our strategic goals of creating additional broadcast scale in new and existing markets 
annual broadcast license impairment tests our annual impairment test on broadcast licenses was performed at individual television and radio stations as of september  the impairment tests indicated two of our television broadcast licenses and two of our radio broadcast licenses were impaired due to declines in revenue share  declines in projected long term market revenues  and a reduction in radio perpetuity growth rates 
the changes in the discount rate used for our broadcast licenses are primarily driven by changes in the expected return on the public equity of comparable companies in the television and media sector and the average cost of capital 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance for goodwill and intangible assets  our broadcast licenses were written down to their estimated fair value of million excludes the broadcast license acquired in december with the acquisition of newschannel network  llc  resulting in a million non cash impairment charge for television and a million non cash impairment charge for radio in the fourth quarter of 
index for broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations  we used the greenfield method  an income approach commonly used in the broadcast sector  to estimate fair value 
this approach assumes the start up of a new station by an independent market participant  and incorporates assumptions that are based on past experience and judgments about future market performance 
these variables include  but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each market including market population  household income and retail sales  estimated market share  profit margins and operating cash flows of an independent station within a market  estimated capital expenditures and start up costs  risk adjusted discount rate  likely media competition within the market and expected growth rates into perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
adverse changes in significant assumptions such as an increase in discount rates  or a decrease in projected market revenues  market share or operating cash flows could result in additional non cash impairment charges on our broadcast licenses in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we based the valuation of broadcast licenses on our internal projections and industry based assumptions september  september  september  september  television discount rate tax rate long term growth rate radio discount rate tax rate long term growth rate as of december   if we were to increase the discount rates by basis points and by basis points  it would result in impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
if we were to decrease the long term growth rates by basis points and by basis points  it would result in impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
interim and annual goodwill impairment tests our annual impairment tests on goodwill associated with our broadcasting reporting unit and our community newspaper and shoppers reporting unit as of september   the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter  indicated there was no impairment of our goodwill 
for purposes of testing the carrying values of goodwill related to our broadcasting reporting unit  we determine fair value by using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows of the reporting unit 
the cash flows are discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value is estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach is based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to estimate fair value 
we assign a greater weight to the income approach as the market approach is deemed less reliable due to the differences in entity size and business model between our broadcasting reporting unit and the comparable companies selected 
we base our fair value estimates  in large measure  on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable 
however  actual future results may differ from those projections  and those differences may be material 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit requires inputs and assumptions ie  market growth  operating cash flow margins and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
we based the valuation of goodwill related to our broadcasting reporting unit on our internal projections and industry based assumptions september  september  september  television discount rate tax rate long term growth rate radio discount rate tax rate long term growth rate as of december   if we were to increase the discount rates by basis points or decrease the long term growth rates by basis points  step two of the goodwill impairment test would not be triggered 

index for purposes of testing the carrying value of goodwill related to our community newspaper and shoppers reporting unit  we determine fair value using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows of the reporting unit 
the cash flows are discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value is estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach is based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to estimate fair value 
each approach estimated a fair value exceeding carrying value 
we assign a greater weight to the income approach as the market approach is deemed less reliable due to the differences in entity size and business model between our community newspapers and shoppers reporting unit and the comparable companies selected 
we base our fair value estimates on various assumptions about our projected operating results  including continuing declines in publishing revenues as well as an expectation that we will achieve cash flow benefits from our continuing cost cutting measures 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit requires inputs and assumptions ie  market growth  operating cash flow margins and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
these assumptions may change due to changes in market conditions and such changes may result in an impairment of our goodwill 
we based the valuation of goodwill related to our community newspapers and shoppers reporting unit on our internal projections and industry based assumptions september  september  september  discount rate tax rate long term growth rate as of december   if we were to increase the discount rates by basis points or decrease the long term growth rates by basis points  step two of the goodwill impairment test would not be triggered

ebitda in was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in we define ebitda as net earnings excluding provision for income taxes  total other expense  net which is comprised of interest income and expense  depreciation and amortization 
management primarily uses ebitda  among other things  to evaluate our operating performance compared to our operating plans and or prior years and to value prospective acquisitions 
we believe the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management  helps to improve their ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates 
ebitda is also a primary measure used externally by our investors and our peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our operating performance to other companies in the industry 
ebitda is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to ebitda measures reported by other companies

in addition  due to the changing mix of revenue categories  changes in frequency and placement of advertising in the newspaper and planned advertising rate decreases in order to increase volume  we continued to see decreases in the average rate per inch of advertising in retail advertising revenue in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the million decrease in retail advertising revenue at our daily newspaper was primarily due to decreases in rop and preprint advertising revenue and the discontinuation of the specialty magazine  milwaukee home and fine living  partially offset by an increase in retail online advertising revenue 
the revenue decreases were in the communications  home improvement  furniture  automotive and finance categories 
we believe consumers are still cautious in regards to spending discretionary income and advertisers are still decreasing their spending in traditional print products  including our daily newspaper 
the same trends persisted in our community newspapers and shoppers business 
the million decrease in retail advertising revenue at our community newspapers and shoppers business was primarily due to revenue decreases as a result of the sale of the florida based publications in and a decrease from publications we decided to exit  and decreases in automotive  retail and real estate advertising 
classified advertising is generally the most sensitive to economic cycles because it is driven by the demand of employment  real estate transactions and automotive sales

we believe this strategy was successful as we experienced a increase in volume for employment classified advertising in compared to historically  rates for employment classified advertising have been higher than other classified advertising categories 
average rates per inch for real estate and automotive advertising revenue also decreased compared to  partially due to our planned decrease in rates for real estate classified advertising revenue

this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from the sunday edition due to a price increase for home delivery 
in early  our daily newspaper launched a program titled big wednesday in which sunday only subscribers receive the wednesday edition of the daily newspaper as part of their existing sunday only subscription

unfunded non qualified pension benefit payments and other postretirement benefits are expected to be funded directly from company assets through qualified pension benefit payments are expected to be funded by plan assets through while benefit payments under these benefit plans are expected to continue beyond  we believe that an estimate beyond this period is unreasonable

we do not rely on off balance sheet arrangements for liquidity  capital resources  market risk support  credit risk support or other benefits 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  litigation  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we do not believe our past results have differed materially from these estimates  however  we cannot predict how actual results may differ from these estimates in the future 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment patterns and terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due us to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history  the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment 
if our evaluations of the collectability of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
property and equipment and definite lived intangibles we assign useful lives for our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation or amortization method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations 
accounting standards require that  if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from an asset or group of assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
an evaluation of our property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets did not indicate any impairment in in  we recognized million of impairment related to certain assets held for sale 
fair value was determined pursuant to a broker s opinion of value 
the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales 
changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment in the future 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and broadcast licenses accounted for and of total assets as of december  and december   respectively 
the interim and annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses in accordance with the fasb s guidance for goodwill and intangible assets require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 

index the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level  which is defined as either an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component is a reporting unit when the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of the component 
components may be combined into one reporting unit when they have similar economic characteristics 
we have three reporting units and we have allocated goodwill to two of them  the community newspaper and shoppers reporting unit and the broadcasting reporting unit 
we performed our annual impairment test for both reporting units as of september  for purposes of testing the carrying values of goodwill related to our reporting units  we determine fair value by using an income and a market valuation approach 
the income approach uses expected cash flows for each reporting unit 
the cash flows are discounted for risk and time value 
in addition  the present value of the projected residual value is estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows 
the market approach is based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to estimate fair value 
we assign a greater weight to the income approach as the market approach is deemed less reliable due to the differences in entity size and business model between our reporting units and the comparable companies selected 
for our community newspaper and shoppers reporting unit  we based our fair value estimates on various assumptions about our projected operating results  including continuing declines in publishing revenues as well as an expectation that we will achieve cash flow benefits from our continuing cost cutting measures 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit requires inputs and assumptions ie  market growth  operating cash flow margins and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
these assumptions may change due to changes in market conditions and such changes may result in an impairment of our goodwill 
for the broadcasting reporting unit  we based our fair value estimates  in large measure  on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable 
however  actual future results may differ from those projections  and those differences may be material 
the valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit requires inputs and assumptions ie  market growth  operating cash flow margins and discount rates that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
for broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations  we use the greenfield method an income approach commonly used in the broadcast sector to estimate fair value 
this approach assumes the start up of a new station by an independent market participant and incorporates assumptions that are based on past experiences and judgments about future market performance 
these variables include  but are not limited to the forecasted growth rate of each market including market population  household income and retail sales  estimated market share  profit margins and operating cash flows of an independent station within a market  estimated capital expenditures and start up costs  risk adjusted discount rate  likely media competition within the market and expected growth rates into perpetuity to estimate terminal values 
adverse changes in significant assumptions such as an increase in discount rates or a decrease in projected market revenues  market share or operating cash flows could result in additional non cash impairment charges on our broadcast licenses in future periods  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we performed our annual impairment test on our broadcast licenses at individual television and radio stations in  which indicated two of our television broadcast licenses and two of our radio broadcast licenses were impaired due to a decline in projected long term market revenues and an increase in the discount rates 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of our broadcasting licenses 
accrued income taxes the internal revenue service irs and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments or have an impact on our effective tax rate 
nonetheless  we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters 
as of december  and december   our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties were million and million  respectively 
we deduct broadcast licenses and tax deductible goodwill over a period of years from the date of acquisition 
the non cash broadcast license impairment charges recorded in and are not currently deductible for income tax purposes and have caused us to recognize deferred tax assets 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize a tax benefit for our deferred tax assets and we believe that they will be utilized to offset future taxable income over the next years in accordance with current income tax law 
in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets if we have future operating losses or reductions in our expected future profitability which would cause us to believe we would be unable to utilize them 
accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions  administrative proceedings and claims 
when necessary  we record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims 
the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

index employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims 
third party administrators are used to process all claims 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience 
liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which may require us to record additional expense in the future 
there are certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations  such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations and expense  the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations  the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid pension benefits 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for and are pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations expected return on plan assets for our pension plans  as of december   a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effects in millions increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in less than less than effect on pension benefit obligation as of december  to determine the discount rate assumptions for the pension and the other postretirement benefit plans  we studied our plans specific discount rate by matching our projected benefit payments to a yield curve developed from high grade corporate bonds 
the results of those studies were used as the benchmark to determine the discount rate assumptions 
we study historical markets to determine the long term rate of return assumption for pension plan assets 
we preserved the long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine long term capital market assumptions 
we review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonability and appropriateness 
we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits 
changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis 
the discount rate and medical cost inflation assumptions could have a significant effect on our other postretirement benefits obligations 
the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation 
the health care cost trend rate is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations 
a one percent increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects in millions increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost components in less than less than effect on postretirement benefit obligation as of december  
index new accounting standards in february  the fasb issued guidance related to items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements i the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and ii the income statement line items affected by the reclassification 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning january  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended guidance for impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
the guidance allows for an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying amount 
if the qualitative factors lead us to conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  then the fair value does not need to be calculated 
this update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for the fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this guidance in in september  the fasb issued amended guidance for goodwill impairment 
the guidance simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity will be required to perform the two step impairment test only if it concludes that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not  less than its carrying value 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of in june  the fasb issued amended guidance for comprehensive income 
the guidance requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
subsequently  in december  the fasb issued its final standard to defer the new requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
the other requirements contained in the new standard on comprehensive income must still be adopted by the fasb 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of and opted to present the total of comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements 
in may  the fasb issued amended guidance for fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the new guidance includes amendments to clarify the definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us generally accepted accounting principles and ifrs 
the guidance also changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of effect of inflation our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation 
we have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity  cost containment programs and  where the competitive environment permits  increased selling prices 
however  changes in newsprint prices could have an adverse impact on costs  which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs 
in addition  inflation and its impact on floating interest rates could affect the amount of interest payments due on our secured credit facilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks  which are borrowings under our secured revolving credit facilities  and in prices for newsprint 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks are variable 
our borrowings under the secured credit facilities incur interest at either a libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  depending on our net debt ratio  or b i the base rate  which equals the highest of the prime rate set by us bank national association  the federal funds rate plus basis points or one month libor plus basis points  plus ii a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  depending on our net debt ratio 
the initial pricing spread above libor was basis points 
average interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit facility ranged from at the beginning of to at the end of if interest rates had been basis points higher  our annual interest expense would have increased million  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
price fluctuations for newsprint can have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the average net price per ton was in based on the consumption of newsprint in for our publishing businesses  a per ton increase or decrease in the price of newsprint would increase or decrease our total cost of newsprint by million 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to newsprint price risk
