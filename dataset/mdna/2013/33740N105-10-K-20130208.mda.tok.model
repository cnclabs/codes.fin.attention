business overview we are a financial holding company headquartered in boca raton  florida 
our principal subsidiary  st united  is a florida chartered commercial bank  which operates banking centers in florida  from central florida through the treasure coast to south florida  including brevard  broward  hillsborough  indian river  miami dade  orange  palm beach  pasco  and pinellas counties 
over the past nine years  we have grown under the stewardship of our highly experienced executive management team 
specifically  we have increased total assets from million to billion  increased total net loans from million to million  grown non interest bearing deposits from million to million  and expanded our branch network from one location to locations 
we follow a business plan that emphasizes the delivery of commercial banking services to businesses and individuals in our geographic market who desire a high level of personalized service 
the business plan includes business banking  professional market services  real estate lending and private banking  as well as full community banking products and services 
the business plan also provides for an emphasis on our small business administration lending program  as well as on small business lending 
we focus on the building of a balanced loan and deposit portfolio  with emphasis on low cost liabilities and variable rate loans 
as is the case with banking institutions generally  our operations are materially and significantly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of financial institution regulatory agencies  including the federal reserve bank and the fdic 
deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing of real estate and other types of loans  which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting local demand and availability of funds 
we face strong competition in the attraction of deposits our primary source of lendable funds and in the origination of loans 
our lending operations are entirely within the state of florida  which has been particularly hard hit in the current economic recession 
evidence of the economic downturn in florida is particularly reflected in recent unemployment statistics and realization of real estate devaluation 
according to data from the us department of labor  the florida unemployment rate seasonally adjusted at december was which is above the national average of 
although the unemployment rate decreased from at the end of and at the end of  florida continues to have one of the highest unemployment rates in the united states  which has adversely affected our market areas as evidenced by layoffs and business closings  as well as wealth reduction due to depressed markets 
we have also experienced a high volume of bankruptcy filings in florida during recent years 
according to the most recent data available from the us federal courts  florida had the second highest number of bankruptcy filings in the united states through the first three quarters of only california experienced more bankruptcy filings 
the majority of the filings in florida were non business bankruptcies 
based on data from the us census bureau  from through the end of  median household income decreased by in florida 
additionally  real estate property valuations have also been depressed during the recent economic downturn as evidenced by our higher level of problem assets and credit related costs 
according to the federal housing finance agency  florida has experienced negative trends in single family home prices as indicated by negative housing price indexes in nearly every quarter since the beginning of through the end of high unemployment  high volumes of non business bankruptcy filings  decreased median household income  and depressed real estate values all affect the value of our loan portfolio and the associated risks 
an extended continuation of the recession in florida would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on our clients  which would likely have a negative impact on our financial results 
we intend to continue to opportunistically expand and grow our business by building on our business strategy and increasing market share in key florida markets 
we believe the demographics and growth characteristics within the communities we serve will provide significant franchise enhancement opportunities to leverage our core competencies while acquisitive growth will enable us to take advantage of the extensive infrastructure and scalable platform that we have assembled

merger reorganization expenses increased by  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of the integration of old harbor and the merger and integration of afi during the year ended december  the million of expense for the year ended december  was the result of the integration of tbom 
costs include legal and professional  it integration and conversion  severance and lease termination fees 
oreo expense increased by  to million for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is due to an increase in the number of oreo properties primarily a result of ore acquired from the old harbor transaction in october period over period and the write down of properties held within the portfolio by  during the year ended december  to market values during the year 
loan expenses primarily include the costs associated with the collection of legacy as well as loss sharing assets 
loan expenses increased by  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the change was primarily due to foreclosure related expenses associated with the increase in loss share assets as a result of the old harbor acquisition 
increases in other non interest expenses of  were primarily due to the afi merger and the acquisition of old harbor 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  non interest expense is comprised of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  and other operating expenses incurred in supporting our various business activities 
during the year ended december   non interest expense increased to million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
a substantial portion of the increase in non interest expense was due to the acquisition of tbom in late and old harbor in october salary and employee benefit costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase was a result of the acquisition of the tbom operation  including three banking centers at the end of subsequently closed in june and the addition of old harbor salaries from that acquisition 
included in the year end december  expense is approximately million of personnel related costs that were eliminated by june  due to the integration of tbom 
in connection with the old harbor acquisition  we increased our employee headcount and salary expense since the date of acquisition on october  inclusive within salary expense is approximately  in salary expense that is anticipated to be eliminated at the end of the first quarter of as operations are fully integrated 
occupancy and equipment increased by million or year over year 
the increase was largely due to  of expense related to space acquired from tbom which was eliminated effective june  additionally  the acquisition of old harbor resulted in additional occupancy expense of approximately  during the quarter ended december   which is anticipated to be eliminated in the first quarter of we also signed a lease in january for additional space for an operations area which increased expense by  data processing costs were million for the year ended december  or an increase of  compared to  due to the increase in the number of items processed as a result of the tbom and old harbor acquisition 
regulatory assessments decreased by  or between the years ended december  and due to a change in the regulatory assessment methodology between periods 
merger reorganization expense of million in related primarily to integration  legal and stay bonus expenses for the old harbor and tbom acquisitions as well as one time compensation related costs 
these amounts are comparable to expenses incurred in related to the republic acquisition 
other non interest expense of million in increased  compared to primarily due to the full year of operations in from the tbom acquisition and two and a half months from the old harbor acquisition 
income tax expense benefit during the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million due to pre tax earnings of million 
during the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million due to pre tax earnings of million 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was which compares to for the year ended december  analysis for three month periods ended december  and net interest income net interest income  which constitutes our principal source of income  represents the excess of interest income on interest earning assets over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
our principal interest earning assets are federal funds sold  investment securities and loans 
our interest bearing liabilities primarily consist of time deposits  interest bearing checking accounts now accounts  savings deposits and money market accounts 
we invest the funds attracted by these interest bearing liabilities in interest earning assets 
accordingly  our net interest income depends upon the volume of average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
the following table reflects the components of net interest income  setting forth for the periods presented  average assets  liabilities and shareholders equity  interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  our net interest spread ie  the average yield on interest earning assets less the average rate on interest bearing liabilities and our net interest margin ie  the net yield on interest earning assets 
net interest earnings for the three month periods ended december  and are reflected in the following table december  december  dollars in thousands average balance interest income expense average rates earned paid average balance interest income expense average rates earned paid assets interest earning assets loans     investment securities    federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements total interest earning assets   non interest earning assets   allowance for loan losses   total assets   liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing liabilities now accounts   money market accounts   savings accounts   certificates of deposit   fed funds purchased and repurchase agreements  federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities   non interest bearing liabilities demand deposit accounts   other liabilities   total non interest bearing liabilities  shareholders equity   total liabilities and shareholders equity  net interest spread   net interest on average earning assets margin our net interest income for the three months ended december  was positively impacted by the increase in average earning assets of million as compared to the three months ended december  primarily the result of loans and investments acquired in the afi merger and old harbor acquisition and the increase in the yield earned on loans 
these increases were offset by a reduction in the overall yield earned on investments quarter to quarter 
earnings for the current quarter were positively impacted by million in accretion of discounts related to acquired loans for the three months ended december  as compared to million for the same period in included in the million of accretion of discount in the quarter ended december  was approximately million related to the disposition of assets acquired in the transactions above the discounted carrying value of the asset 
included in the million of accretion discount in was approximately million related to the disposition of assets above the discounted carrying values 
net interest income was million for the three months ended december   as compared to million for the three months ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase resulted primarily from an increase in average earning assets of million or primarily due to the afi merger and old harbor acquisition  an increase in accretion income of million and a reduction of the costs of funds of basis points offset by a decrease in the yield earned on securities quarter over quarter 
the net interest margin ie  net interest income divided by average earning assets increased basis points from during the three months ended december  to during the three months ended december   mainly the result of an increase in interest accretion on acquired loans  the increase in overall interest earning assets and reduction in cost of funds 
accretion of million on acquired loans added approximately basis points to the net interest margin for the quarter ended december  of the basis points  basis points related to the accretion on the disposition of assets acquired above the discounted carrying value 
this compares to accretion of loan discount of million during the three months ended december   which added approximately basis points to the december  margin 
of the basis points  basis points related to the accretion on the disposition of assets acquired above the discounted carrying value 
for the three months ended december   average loans represented of total average assets and of total average deposits and customer repurchase agreements  compared to average loans of of total average assets and average loans of to total average deposits and customer repurchase agreements at december  our cost of funds was approximately basis points lower for the three months ended december   as compared to  primarily as a result of lower rates offered on our deposit products 
rate volume analysis the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in our interest income and interest expense for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in interest rate and changes in the volume 
changes in both volume and rate have been allocated based on the proportionate absolute changes in each category 
changes in interest earnings for the three months ended december  and december  and dollars in thousands change in interest income expense variance due to volume changes variance due to rate changes assets interest earning assets loans   investment securities federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements total interest earning assets   liabilities interest bearing liabilities now accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit fed funds purchased and repurchase agreements other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities net interest spread   inflation the impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property  plant and equipment 
assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature  and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices 
while the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates  interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of our ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled results of operations 
interest rate risk management our net income is largely dependent on net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income 
net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest earning assets that are funded by interest bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds  such as non interest bearing deposits and shareholders equity 
we manage our interest rate risk through st united s asset liability committee alco board committee which meets quarterly and through our internal management committee which meets more frequently 
management closely monitors st united s interest at risk calculations through model simulations and reports the results of its rate stress testing to alco on a quarterly basis 
we have established policy limits of risk  which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income a measure of net interest income at risk and the fair value of equity capital a measure of economic value of equity eve at risk resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for maturities from one day to years 
we measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short term earnings  long term value  and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling 
the simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts 
as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by us 
when interest rates change  actual movements in different categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  loan prepayments  and withdrawals of time and other deposits  may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model 
finally  the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan customers ability to service their debts  or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan  lease  and deposit products 
our interest rate risk management goal is to avoid unacceptable variations in net interest income and capital levels due to fluctuations in market rates 
management attempts to achieve this goal by balancing  within policy limits  the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched  by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits  and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis 
the balance sheet is subject to testing for interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk 
average interest rates are shocked by plus or minus and basis points bp and plus bp  although we may elect not to use particular scenarios that we determined are impractical in a current rate environment 
it is management s goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a one year and two year period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels 
st united has been consistently within policy limits on rates stress test up and down   and bp  both for net interest margin and eve 
management has closely monitored st united s gap position which has been slightly liability sensitive during a stable rate environment 
the following tables illustrate the above measurements at year end december  net interest margin actual change at or hundred basis point change in interest rates dollars in thousands net interest income at one year    interest change     percentage change net interest income at two years    interest change     percentage change economic value of equity actual change at or hundred basis point change in interest rates dollars in thousands equity value at one year    value change at     percent change at rate sensitive assets over rate sensitive liabilities at december  the twelve month gap position was at

in addition to the normal inflow of funds from core deposit growth together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  we utilize other short term funding sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase  overnight federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short term deposits from public entities  federal home loan bank advances and brokered time deposits 
we monitor and manage our liquidity position on several fronts  which vary depending upon the time period 
as the time period is expanded  other data is factored in  including estimated loan funding requirements  estimated loan payoffs  investment portfolio maturities or calls  and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs 
we classify all of our securities as available for sale  thereby maintaining liquidity 
our liquidity position is further enhanced by structuring our loan portfolio interest payments as monthly complemented by retail credit and residential mortgage loans in our loan portfolio  resulting in a steady stream of loan repayments 
in managing our investment portfolio  we provide for staggered maturities so that cash flows are provided as such investments mature 
our cash flows are comprised of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities  offset by those provided by operating activities and financing activities  resulted in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million from december  to december  during the year ended december   we experienced net cash transferred from acquisitions of million  proceeds from sales of securities and maturities and prepayments of million offset by purchases of securities of million and proceeds  net of originations  from loans of million and the proceeds from the sale of oreo of million 
our securities portfolio  federal funds sold  and cash and due from bank deposit balances serve as primary sources of liquidity for us 
at december   we had cash and due from bank balances of million and available to be pledged securities in the amount of million 
in november  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec through which we may sell from time to time any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  subscription rights  and units  in one or more offerings 
we may seek to obtain debt or equity financings in the future 
such financings  however  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  the loss sharing agreements with the fdic limit our ability to raise additional equity if a change of control would occur as defined in the loss sharing agreements 
at december   we had no borrowings from the fhlb 
at december   we had commitments to originate loans totaling million 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the twelve months following december  totaled million 
management believes that we have adequate resources to fund all of our commitments  that substantially all of our existing commitments will be funded in the subsequent twelve months and  if so desired  that we can adjust the rates on certificates of deposit and other deposit accounts to retain deposits in a changing interest rate environment 
at december   we had short term lines of credit available from correspondent banks totaling million  federal reserve bank discount window availability of million and borrowing capacity from the fhlb of million based on collateral pledged  for a total credit available of million 
in addition  being well capitalized  st united can access the wholesale deposits for approximately million based on current policy limits 
contractual obligations contractual agreements at december  were as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years certificates of deposit     operating leases      total      we discuss our securities portfolio  deposits and borrowings further in item business 
capital resources the following table summarizes the changes in our shareholders equity for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year ended december  balance at beginning of period   issuance of common stock for acquisition  net of costs of sale of common stock  net of costs  stock based compensation expense   dividends paid  net income   change in unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities balance at end of period   the federal banking regulatory authorities have adopted certain prompt corrective action rules with respect to depository institutions 
the rules establish five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the various federal banking regulatory agencies have adopted regulations to implement the capital rules by  among other things  defining the relevant capital measures for the five capital categories 
an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier i risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a tier i leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to a regulatory order  agreement  or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level 
at december   st united met the capital ratios of a well capitalized financial institution with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a tier i leverage ratio of 
depository institutions which fall below the adequately capitalized category generally are prohibited from making any capital distribution  are subject to growth limitations  and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
there are a number of requirements and restrictions that may be imposed on institutions treated as significantly undercapitalized and  if the institution is critically undercapitalized  the banking regulatory agencies have the right to appoint a receiver or conservator 
the following represents bancorp s regulatory capital ratios for the respective periods well capitalized regulatory requirement december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to total average assets a a tier i capital to year end assets is 
we completed the issuance of  shares during the year ended december  at per share for total additional proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs of million 
in addition  we have an effective shelf registration statement  which may be used from time to time when additional capital is required 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently engage in the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
however  we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our clients 
at december   we had million in commitments to originate loans and million in standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party 
we use the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
if commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels  management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact our ability to meet on going obligations 
in the event these commitments require funding in excess of historical levels  management believes current liquidity  available lines of credit from the fhlb  investment security maturities and our revolving credit facility provide a sufficient source of funds to meet these commitments 
critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses management views critical accounting policies as accounting policies that are important to the understanding of our financial statements and also involve estimates and judgments about inherently uncertain matters 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets and assumptions that affect the recognition of income and expenses on the consolidated statements of income for the periods presented 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in subsequent periods are described as follows 
the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually evaluated for impairment 
for such loans  an allowance for loan losses is established based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the market price of the loan  or  if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs of sale 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays loan payments made within days of the due date and payment shortfalls which are tracked as past due amounts on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
management considers loan payments made within days of the due date to be insignificant payment delays 
payment shortfalls are traced as past due amounts 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction and land development loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs of sale if the loan is collateral dependent 
the general component considers the actual historical charge offs over a rolling two year period by portfolio segment 
the actual historical charge off ratio is adjusted for qualitative factors including delinquency trends  loss and recovery trends  classified asset trends  non accrual trends  economic and business conditions and other external factors by portfolio segment of loans 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of business acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values 
we acquired first western bank  on april   equitable on february   citrus on august   republic on december   tbom on december   old harbor on october  and afi in april of consequently  we were required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective  as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill  which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair value of the reporting unit compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
as of december   the required annual impairment test of goodwill was performed and no impairment existed as of the valuation date 
if for any future period we determine that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances  we will record a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our net income  but not to our risk based capital ratios 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between revenues and expenses reported for financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled 
a valuation allowances is provided against deferred tax assets which are not likely to be realized 
purchased credit impaired loans we account for acquisitions under the purchase accounting method 
all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value 
we review each loan or loan pool acquired to determine whether there is evidence of a deterioration in credit quality since inception and if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual loan agreements 
we consider expected prepayments and estimated cash flows including principal and interest payments at the date of acquisition 
the amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows is not accreted into earnings 
the amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows over the book value of the loan is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan accretable yield 
the company records these loans on the acquisition date at their net realizable value 
thus  an allowance for estimated future losses is not established on the acquisition date 
we refine our estimates of the fair value of loans acquired for up to one year from the date of acquisition 
subsequent to the date of acquisition  we update the expected future cash flows on loans acquired 
losses or a reduction in cash flow which arise subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as a charge through the provision for loan losses 
an increase in the expected cash flows adjusts the level of the accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan 
fdic loss share receivable we have entered into agreements with the fdic for reimbursement of losses within acquired loan portfolios 
the fdic loss share receivable is recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition based upon the expected reimbursements to be received from the fdic adjusted by a discount rate which reflects counter party credit risk and other uncertainties 
changes in the underlying credit quality of the loans covered by the fdic loss share receivable result in either an increase or a decrease in the fdic loss share receivable 
deterioration in loan credit quality increases the fdic loss share receivable  increases in credit quality decrease the fdic loss share receivable 
proceeds received for reimbursement of incurred losses reduce the fdic loss share receivable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic loss from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in a interest rates  b foreign exchange rates  or c other factors that relate to market volatility of the rate  index  or price underlying the financial instrument 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
st united has an asset liability committee alco which is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position  and establishing policies to monitor and limit the exposure to interest rate risk 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin  after tax return on assets and return on equity capital  as well as adequate liquidity and capital 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored through gap analysis  which measures the amount of repricing risk associated with the balance sheet at specific points in time 
see interest rate risk management and liquidity and capital resources presented in item above for quantitative disclosures in tabular format  as well as additional qualitative disclosures
