our effective tax rate in fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to the effects that higher net income attributable to common stockholders has on our effective rate when compared to the fixed nature of our washington dc tax credits that we receive due to our status as a qualified high technology company under the new e conomy transformation act of the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to a higher balance of tax exempt investments and an increase in washington  dc tax credits that we received under the new e conomy transformation act of  partially offset by a slight increase in our effective state tax rate due to changes in apportionment

non gaap financial measures we use non gaap financial measures to supplement the financial information presented on a gaap basis 
the non gaap financial measures presented in this report include adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and non gaap earnings per diluted share 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to common stockholders before adjustment for the items set forth in the first table below 
we define adjusted net income as net income attributable to common stockholders excluding the net of tax effect of the items set forth in the second table below  we define non gaap earnings per diluted share as earnings per diluted share excluding the net of tax effect of the items set forth in the third table below 
our management believes that providing information about adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income  and non gaap earnings per diluted share facilitates an assessment by our investors of the company s fundamental operating trends and addresses concerns of 
table of contents management and investors that the various gains and expenses excluded from these measures may obscure such underlying trends 
our management uses these non gaap financial measures  together with financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap  to enhance its understanding of our core operating performance  which represents our views concerning our performance in the ordinary  ongoing  and customary course of our operations 
in the future  we are likely to incur income and expenses similar to the items for which the applicable gaap measures have been adjusted and to report non gaap financial measures excluding such items 
accordingly  the exclusion of those and similar items in our non gaap presentation should not be interpreted as implying that the items are non recurring  infrequent  or unusual 
the information about our core operating performance provided by our non gaap financial measures is used by management for a variety of purposes 
management uses the non gaap financial measures for internal budgeting and other managerial purposes in part because the measures enable management to evaluate projected operating results and make comparative assessments of our performance over time while isolating the effects of items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance  such as tax rates  interest income and foreign currency exchange rates  periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets  share based compensation expense  and certain non cash and special charges 
the effects of the foregoing items also vary widely among similar companies  and affect the ability of management and investors to make company to company comparisons 
in addition  merger and acquisition activity can have inconsistent effects on earnings that are not related to core operating performance due  for instance  to charges relating to acquisition costs  the amortization of acquisition related intangibles  and fluctuations in the fair value of contingent earn out liabilities  and investments in common stock warrants 
companies also exhibit significant variations with respect to capital structure and cost of capital which affect relative interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies 
by eliminating some of the foregoing variations  management believes that the company s non gaap financial measures allow management and investors to evaluate more effectively the company s performance relative to that of its competitors and peer companies 
similarly  our management believes that because of the variety of equity awards used by companies  the varying methodologies for determining both share based compensation and share based compensation expense among companies  and from period to period  and the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations  excluding share based compensation from our non gaap financial measures enhances company to company comparisons over multiple fiscal periods 
our non gaap measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits their usefulness as comparative measures 
in addition  there are other limitations associated with the non gaap financial measures we use  including the following the non gaap financial measures generally do not reflect all depreciation and amortization  and although the assets being depreciated and amortized will in some cases have to be replaced in the future  the measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  the non gaap financial measures do not reflect the expense of equity awards to employees  the non gaap financial measures do not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that management considers not indicative of our ongoing operations  but which may recur from year to year  and to the extent that we change our accounting for certain transactions or other items from period to period  our non gaap financial measures may not be directly comparable from period to period 
our management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using the non gaap financial measures only as a supplemental measure of our operating performance  and by considering independently the economic effects of the foregoing items that are or are not reflected in the non gaap measures 
due to their limitations  our non gaap financial measures should be considered by our investors only in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered to be a substitute for  or superior to  the gaap measures as indicators of operating performance 
a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is provided below unaudited  in thousands

we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities balances  and operating cash flows will be sufficient to support our expected operating and capital expenditures  as well as share repurchases  during at least the next months 
we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances of million as of march  and million as of march  we expended million and million in cash to purchase shares of our common stock through our share repurchase program during fiscal and  respectively 
we had no long term indebtedness as of march  or cash flows from operating activities 
the combination of revenue growth  profitable operations  and payment for memberships in advance of accrual revenue typically results in operating activities that generate cash flows in excess of net income attributable to common stockholders on an annual basis 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to acceleration in contract value and deferred revenue growth  as well as to an increase in adjusted net income 
the decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal was due to the timing of payments received  and to a lesser extent  an increase in certain acquisition related earn out payments classified as cash flows used in operating activities

we may use the proceeds of borrowings under the facility  when drawn  to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes  including permitted acquisitions 
amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility generally will bear interest at an annual rate calculated  at our option  on the basis of either a an alternate base rate plus the applicable margin for alternate base rate loans under the credit agreement  which ranges from to based on our total leverage ratio  or b an adjusted libo rate plus the applicable margin for eurocurrency loans under the credit agreement  which ranges from to based on our total leverage ratio

the facility also contains customary affirmative covenants  including  among others  covenants requiring compliance with laws  maintenance of corporate existence  licenses  properties and insurance  payment of taxes and performance of other material obligations  and delivery of financial and other information to the lenders under the credit agreement 
we are required under the credit agreement to satisfy the following three financial ratios  each of which will be measured for us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the end of each fiscal quarter a maximum total leverage ratio  under which the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and other items specified in the credit agreement ebitda may not be greater than to  a maximum senior secured leverage ratio  under which the ratio of consolidated total secured indebtedness to consolidated ebitda may not be greater than to  and a minimum interest coverage ratio  under which the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense may not be less than to 
consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement currently is not computed  and in the future may not be computed  in the same manner in which we define adjusted ebitda from time to time for purposes of reports we file with the sec and present in our other publicly available financial disclosures

summary of critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this listing is not a comprehensive identification of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observation of trends in the industry  information provided by our members  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
fees are generally billable when a letter of agreement is signed by the member  and fees receivable during the subsequent twelve month period and related deferred revenue are recorded upon the commencement of the membership or collection of fees  if earlier 
in many of our higher priced programs and membership agreements with terms that are greater than one year  fees may be billed on an installment basis 
our membership agreements with our customers generally include more than one deliverable 
deliverables are determined based upon the availability and delivery method of the services and may include best practices research  executive education curricula  web based content  databases  and calculators  performance or benchmarking reports  diagnostic tools  interactive advisory support  and software tools 
access to such deliverables is generally available on an unlimited basis over the membership period 
when an agreement contains multiple deliverables  we review the deliverables to determine if they qualify as separate units of accounting 
in order for deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement to be treated as separate units of accounting  the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery  and delivery or performance of undelivered items in an arrangement with a general right of return must be probable 
if we determine that there are separate units of accounting  arrangement consideration at the inception of the membership period is allocated to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy  which includes vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  if available  third party evidence  or tpe  if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
our membership programs may contain certain deliverables that do not have standalone value and therefore are not accounted for separately 
in general  the deliverables in membership programs are consistently available throughout the membership period  and  as a result  the consideration is recognized ratably over the membership period 
when a service offering includes unlimited and limited service offerings  revenue is then recognized over the appropriate service period  either ratably  if the service is consistently available  or  if the service is not consistently available  upon the earlier of the delivery of the service or the completion of the membership period  provided that all other criteria for recognition have been met 
certain membership programs incorporate hosted software tools 
in many of these agreements  members are charged set up fees in addition to subscription fees for access to the hosted web based software tools and related membership services 
both set up fees and subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the membership agreement  which is generally three years  and is consistent with the pattern of the delivery of services under these arrangements 
upon launch of a new program that incorporates a software tool  all program revenue is deferred until the program is generally available for release to our membership  and then recognized ratably over the remainder of the contract term of each agreement 

table of contents we also perform professional services sold under separate agreements that include management and consulting services 
we recognize professional services revenues on a time and materials basis as services are rendered 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments with respect to revenue recognition is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
allowance for uncollectible revenue our ability to collect outstanding receivables from our members has an effect on our operating performance and cash flows 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible revenue as a reduction of revenue based on our ongoing monitoring of members credit and the aging of receivables 
to determine the allowance for uncollectible revenue  we examine our collections history  the age of accounts receivable in question  any specific member collection issues that have been identified  general market conditions  and current economic trends 
property and equipment property and equipment consists of leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures  equipment  capitalized internal software development costs  and acquired developed technology 
property and equipment is stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
in certain membership programs  we provide software tools under a hosting arrangement where the software application resides on our service providers hardware 
the members do not take delivery of the software and only receive access to the software tools during the term of their membership agreement 
computer software development costs that are incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred 
during the development stage  direct consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees that are directly associated with each project are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software once placed into operation 
capitalized software is amortized using the straight line method over its estimated useful life  which is generally five years 
replacements and major improvements are capitalized  while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
acquired developed technology is classified as property and equipment because the developed software application resides on our service providers hardware 
amortization for acquired developed software is included in the depreciation and amortization line item of our consolidated statements of income 
acquired developed software is amortized over its estimated useful life of six years based on the cash flow estimate used to determine the value of the intangible asset 
furniture  fixtures  and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to seven years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term 
business combinations we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date 
all subsequent changes to a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position that relate to the acquired company and existed at the acquisition date that occur both within the measurement period and as a result of facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
all other changes in a valuation allowance are recognized as a reduction or increase to expense or as a direct adjustment to additional paid in capital as required 
we capitalize any acquired in process research and development as an intangible asset and amortize it over its estimated useful life 
acquisition related costs are recorded as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations resulting from changes in the estimates of earn out results can materially impact the financial statements 
as of march   we had a liability of million for contingent consideration related to acquisitions 
goodwill and other intangible assets the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather tested for impairment on an annual basis as of march  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
we have concluded that our reporting units we use to assess goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments 
when testing for impairment  we first perform a qualitative assessment on a reporting unit to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing is necessary 
if an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the 
table of contents carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  additional quantitative testing is performed 
if the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired  the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the income approach  under which the fair value of a reporting unit is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these valuations require the use of management s assumptions  which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 
based on our qualitative assessment as of march   we had no reporting unit that our management believed was at risk of failing an impairment test that would result in an impairment charge 
no quantitative testing was deemed necessary 
other intangible assets consist of capitalized software for sale and acquired intangibles 
we capitalize consulting costs and payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly related to building a software product once technological feasibility is established 
we determine that technological feasibility is established by the completion of a detailed program design or  in its absence  completion of a working model 
once the software product is ready for general availability  we cease capitalizing costs and begin amortizing the intangible asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life through cost of services on our consolidated statements of income 
the weighted average estimated useful life of capitalized software is five years 
other intangible assets include assets that arise from business combinations consisting of developed technology  non competition covenants  trademarks  contracts  and customer relationships that are amortized  on a straight line basis  over six months to ten years 
finite lived intangible assets are required to be amortized over their useful lives and are evaluated for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
future business and economic conditions  as well as differences related to any of the assumptions discussed herein  could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill and intangibles and or acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangibles  which are finite lived assets 
recovery of long lived assets excluding goodwill we record our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  at cost 
we review the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable 
the test for recoverability is made using an estimate of the undiscounted expected future cash flows and  if required  the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value if the asset is not recoverable 
we consider expected cash flows and estimated future operating results  trends  and other available information in assessing whether the carrying value of assets is impaired 
if we determine that an asset s carrying value is impaired  we will record a write down of the carrying value of the identified asset and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
deferred incentive compensation and other charges incentive compensation to our employees related to the negotiation of new and renewal memberships  license fees to third party vendors for tools  data  and software incorporated in specific memberships that include software tools  and other direct and incremental costs associated with specific memberships are deferred and amortized over the term of the related memberships 
income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
under this method  temporary differences arise as a result of the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax law and tax rates on the date of the enactment of the change 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize stock based compensation cost based on the estimated fair values of the stock based awards on the grant date 
stock based compensation costs are recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting periods of the awards 
we calculate the grant date estimated fair value of all stock options  with the exception of the stock options issued with market based conditions  using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of stock options issued with market based conditions is calculated on the date of grant using a lattice option pricing model 
determining the estimated fair value of stock based awards is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including the term of the stock based 
table of contents awards  risk free interest rates over the vesting period  expected dividend rates  the price volatility of our shares  and forfeiture rates of the awards 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and adjusted  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience 
our fair value estimates are based on assumptions we believe are reasonable but that are inherently uncertain 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined as the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs  experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation  or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates  among other potential factors  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from the expense and the tax benefits we have recorded in previous reporting periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  which is designed for safety of principal and liquidity 
cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid us treasury obligations with maturities of less than three months 
as of march   our marketable securities consisted of million in tax exempt notes and bonds issued by various states  and million in us government sponsored enterprise securities 
the weighted average maturity on all our marketable securities as of march  was approximately years 
we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit ratings related to our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
our portfolio is subject to inherent interest rate risk as investments mature and are reinvested at current market interest rates 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments to adjust our portfolio risk or income profile 
due to the nature of our investments we have not prepared quantitative disclosure for interest rate sensitivity in accordance with item of the sec s regulation s k as we believe the effect of interest rate fluctuations would not be material 
foreign currency risk 
although they accounted for approximately of our fiscal revenue  our international operations subject us to risks related to currency exchange fluctuations 
prices for our services sold to members located outside the united states are sometimes denominated in local currencies primarily the british pound sterling 
as a consequence  increases in the us dollar against local currencies in countries where we have members would result in a foreign exchange loss recognized by us 
in fiscal   and  we recorded foreign currency exchange gains of million  million  and a foreign currency exchange loss of million  respectively  which are included in other income  net in our consolidated statements of income 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial position as of march
