overview we sell technology themed retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers through our thinkgeek 
com website and to our wholesale channel customers 
we offer a broad range of unique products in a single web property that are not available in traditional brick and mortar stores 
we introduce a range of new products to our audience on a regular basis and sell our own innovative geeklabs products developed in house 
we have several wholesale partnerships with brick and mortar retailers that allow us to reach a new consumer audience and expand our unique brand 
we have recently established and strengthened existing partnerships with certain retail store chains that have hundreds of locations throughout the united states and canada 
prior to september   we had two operating segments e commerce and media 
e commerce sells technology themed retail products for technology enthusiasts and general consumers through our thinkgeek 
com website and to our wholesale channel customers 
our media segment provided web properties that served as platforms for the creation  review and distribution of online peer produced content  using our media websites  sourceforge  slashdot  and freecode 
on may   we announced that our board of directors was exploring strategic alternatives with respect to our media business  including the sourceforge  slashdot and freecode websites 
we  along with our advisers  evaluated a range of options to maximize shareholder value  including  but not limited to  selling the media business 
we received bids from various organizations interested in purchasing the media business and reviewed each one carefully with our advisers 
on september  the closing date  we entered into an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement with dice holdings  inc dice and two of dice s subsidiaries  dice career solutions  inc and efinancialcareers limited collectively  the buyers pursuant to which the buyers purchased our media business  including the sourceforge  slashdot and freecode websites the purchased business and assumed certain related liabilities 
our board of directors and management believe that selling the media business will allow us to focus our business strategy on growing and improving our e commerce business and our thinkgeek sourced and custom developed products 
we believe the proceeds generated from the sale of the media business and management ability to solely focus on our core e commerce business will result in a positive impact to our future business strategy 
in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement  the buyers paid us million in cash  of which million was deposited by the buyers into an escrow account for a period of twelve months after the closing date in order to secure our indemnification obligations to the buyers for breaches of our representations  warranties  covenants and other obligations under the purchase agreement 
the purchase agreement contains customary representations  warranties and covenants 
subject to certain exceptions and limitations  each party has agreed to indemnify the other for breaches of representations  warranties and covenants and other specified matters 
the purchase agreement generally limits the company liability for breaches of representations and warranties made in the purchase agreement to an aggregate of million 
the purchase agreement also contains covenants requiring us not to solicit or hire certain employees of the buyers or 
table of contents compete with the purchased business for a period of three years 
we have also agreed with dice to provide certain transition services to one another through december  thinkgeek business strategy is to increase revenue by expanding the range of new and innovative products we sell  including our exclusive geeklabs products  to manage gross margin dollars at the product level  and to increase traffic to our site and customer conversion 
we attract traffic to our site by using a variety of traditional online and direct retail marketing channels including paid search and e mail to our customers and followers 
we continue to use the capabilities of the internet  including social networking sites such as facebook  twitter and youtube  to increase brand awareness and to communicate with our customers 
our thinkgeek business is highly seasonal  reflecting the general pattern associated with the retail industry of peak sales and earnings during the calendar year end holiday shopping season 
in the past several years  a substantial portion of thinkgeek revenue has occurred in the fourth quarter ending december as is typical in the retail industry  we generally experience lower monthly revenue during the first nine months of the year 
each year we initiate programs and promotions to attract additional customers and increase sales from our existing customer base 
this year we enhanced our geek points program by making the program more flexible for our customers and in the first half of we will be modifying this program 
we ran special programs to discount certain products and product lines and we offered free shipping and discounted shipping days 
we regularly send direct marketing e mails to our customers and we increase the number of e mails and promotions during the fourth quarter in preparation for the holiday season 
we also utilize facebook  twitter and youtube to generate interest in our new product launches 
we expect to continue to expand and diversify our sales and marketing programs next year 
during the first quarter of  we restructured certain areas of the business and hired three new members of the senior leadership team 
these changes will impact our operations beginning in the first quarter of we look forward to the knowledge  creativity  experience and passion these talented individuals will bring to the business 
we currently use the following key metrics to measure our e commerce business year ended december  daily unique visitors in thousands number of orders received in thousands conversion rate average order value received number of orders shipped in thousands average order value shipped unique visitors is the total of unique visitors for the thinkgeek website during the periods presented 
this data is accumulated daily and can include the same unique visitor on different days 
we track unique visitors and the volume of traffic to our website to help us determine the effectiveness of our online marketing efforts 
the number of orders received represents all orders placed on the thinkgeek website during each period shown and does not necessarily correlate to revenue recognized during the period 
for example  some orders placed on the thinkgeek website at the end of a reporting period are recognized as revenue in the subsequent reporting period because delivery had not yet occurred 
average order value received or shipped is calculated by the total sales for orders received or shipped divided by the number of orders received or shipped 
average order value can vary depending on  but not limited to  seasonality  promotions  the number of volume sales in a given period  the competitive environment and economic conditions 
the number of orders shipped represents all orders associated with the amount of revenue recognized for thinkgeek for the period presented 
wholesale channel sales contributed to the total average order value shipped 
excluding wholesale channel sales  average order value shipped for thinkgeek website orders was and for the years ended december  and wholesale channel sales were insignificant compared to total sales during and therefore did not have a meaningful impact on average order value shipped for the year ended december  
table of contents critical accounting policies accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  inventories  the assessment of impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation and discontinued operations 
basis of presentation the results of our media business  which was sold on september   are classified as discontinued operations for the years ended december   and in the company consolidated statement of operations 
the results include media business revenues  cost of sales and operating and non operating expenses  excluding general corporate costs 
also included as discontinued operations for the year ended december  are the results from the sale of the company geek 
com business 
the cash flows from the media business operating and investing activities are shown separately in cash flows from discontinued operations  with the exception of proceeds from the sale of the media business and related transaction costs 
the assets and liabilities related to the media business are included in their respective sections on the december  consolidated balance sheet as they did not meet the criteria for classification as assets held for sale at that date 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our accounting treatment for accruing liabilities for our geek points loyalty program 
we performed an analysis on the costs incurred for redeeming the geek points using historical data and determined that the liabilities were understated at the end of each of the reporting periods presented 
although the impact of the adjustments is immaterial  we adjusted our consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented 
net revenue net revenue is derived from the online sale of consumer goods and through our wholesale channel 
net revenues are presented net of sales tax 
we recognize revenue from consumer goods when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is deferred for orders shipped but not delivered before the end of the period 
the amount recorded as deferred revenue is estimated because of our high volume of transactions and the use of multiple shipping carriers 
these estimates are used to determine what orders that shipped at the end of the reporting period  were delivered and should be recognized as revenue 
when calculating these estimates  we consider historical experiences of shipping transit times for domestic and international orders using different carriers 
on average  shipping transit times are approximately one to six business days 
as of december  and december   million and million  respectively  was recognized as deferred revenue for orders placed at the end of the reporting period  but not yet delivered 
we also engage in the sale of gift certificates 
when a gift certificate is sold  revenue is deferred until the certificate is redeemed and the products are delivered 
deferred revenue at december  and december  relating to gift certificates was million and million  respectively 
we reserve an amount for estimated returns at the end of each reporting period 
we generally give customers a day right to return products 
these estimates are based on historical trends of amounts returned per revenue for a period 
reserves for returns at december  and december  were million and million  respectively  and are recorded as accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
we voluntarily ceased selling a product in july because of safety concerns 
we are offering our customers who have purchased this product  the opportunity to return the product in exchange for a thinkgeek 
table of contents credit 
as of december   we issued an insignificant amount of credits 
we believe the reserves for returns at december  to be adequate 
inventories inventories consist solely of finished goods that are valued at the lower of cost  using the weighted average cost method  or market 
we review inventories each quarter and  when required  reduce estimated excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable values 
long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets in measuring whether they are recoverable 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  a loss is recorded as the excess of the asset s carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
geek points loyalty program we maintain a customer loyalty program by issuing geek points to participating customers for certain purchases of products 
customers can redeem their geek points toward future purchases in accordance with program rules and promotions 
geek points expire three years from the date they are earned 
the company accrues the cost of anticipated redemptions using an estimated redemption rate calculated based on historical experiences and trends  adjusted for known modifications to the program that will occur in the future 
the cost of the redemptions is included in cost of revenues on the company consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at grant date fair value and recognize the expense net of estimated forfeitures for shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
calculating compensation expense for stock options requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock option grant  stock price volatility  interest rates and the forfeiture rate 
the fair value of the option grants are calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the expected life is based on historical settlement patterns 
expected volatility is based on the historical implied volatility of our stock 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical trends of our stock based awards that cancel 
income taxes the company has recognized a deferred tax asset associated with previously reported net operating losses  which can result in a future tax benefit 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has recognized a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax asset as there is insufficient evidence to support that it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized 
the company reviews its valuation allowance at each reporting period using  but not limited to  forecasted financial information to determine if the deferred tax assets could more likely than not be realized and after considering the impact of limits sanctioned by internal revenue code section on the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
the company provides for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
contingencies and litigation 
table of contents we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of any loss contingency required is assessed and recorded  if probable  after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required loss contingencies may change in the future as the facts and circumstances of each matter change

year ended december  year ended december  change change in thousands cost of revenue gross margin gross margin cost of revenues increased million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in product costs of million and packaging and fulfillment costs of million  partially offset by a lower expense of million related to a reduction of our geek points liability and a lower expense of million due to a rebate received from a vendor

these increases were due to the increase in revenues and number of orders 
fulfillment costs were also higher due to the start up costs related to moving to a new fulfillment center 
the increase in merchandising and customer support costs was also due to increased personnel required to support our broader product offering 

table of contents gross margin as a percentage of revenues increased by two percentage points due to a decrease in seventeen full time equivalents ftes 
during the first quarter of  we began outsourcing our customer service department  which reduced ftes 
we also redirected certain of our workforce from merchandising  included as cost of revenue  to developing our own innovative products in our geeklabs  included in technology and design 
also contributing to better margins is our efforts to reduce shipping costs due to renegotiations with our largest shipping supplier 
gross margin percentage for the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  due to higher customer discounts as well as increased inbound shipping costs  fulfillment costs and merchandising and customer support costs 
the higher customer discounts were primarily due to decisions to discontinue certain products in the second and third quarters of to prepare for the peak holiday season and apparel promotions during the holiday season 
we are continually analyzing gross margins by the product and category levels to ensure that product mix and product costs are in line with our gross margin expectations 
we work to manage gross margins through negotiations with our vendors to reduce product  materials and in bound shipping costs

the increase in discretionary marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase of million in paid affiliate fees and million increase in promotional materials 
the increase in credit card fees was due to an increase in our revenue 
technology and design expenses during the fourth quarter of  we changed the name of our research and development department to technology and design 
we believe that the name technology and design conforms to similar naming conventions used in our industry for similar activities 
technology and design expenses consist of personnel and related overhead expenses for geeklabs and developers that design and create new products to sell on our thinkgeek website 
it also includes personnel and related overhead and technology expenses for our engineering group that work to continually improve website design  functionality and capacity 
we expense all of our technology and design costs as they are incurred

there was not a similar benefit in and as there was income or loss in both continuing and discontinuing operations in those years 

table of contents we have recently completed a study addressing the recoverability of our net operating loss carryforwards 
the results of the study indicated that there was a change of control as defined by section of the internal revenue code irc in as a result of the change of control  certain net operating losses previously included in our deferred tax disclosures will not be available to offset future taxable income as the irc limits the annual utilization of these carryforwards 
consistent with what we have done historically  we continue to fully reduce the net operating loss carryforwards and all other deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
this is due to our conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would not recover the deferred tax assets because of management uncertainties about our ability to generate taxable income in the future 
our previously reported net operating loss carryforwards of million as of december  will be limited to million  of which million will be utilized to offset taxable income in also reducing the net operating loss carryforwards was million of recognized built in losses
