item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal years ended august   fiscal year  august  fiscal year  and august  fiscal year included in item of this report 
overview in fiscal year  we generated revenues primarily by providing quality food to customers at our luby s cafeteria branded restaurants located primarily in texas  fuddruckers restaurants located throughout the united states  koo koo roo restaurants in california  cheeseburger in paradise restaurants  and fuddruckers franchises located primarily in the united states 
on july   we became a multi brand restaurant company with a national footprint through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers 
the fuddruckers acquisition added company operated restaurants and a franchise network of franchisee operated units 
this acquisition further expanded our family friendly  value oriented portfolio of restaurants located in close proximity to retail centers  business developments and residential areas 
on december   we further expanded our brand family with the addition of the cheeseburger in paradise brand 
this added full service restaurant and bar locations that complement our core family friendly brands and provided an entry point to operate in new locations at a cost of less than million per restaurant 
in addition to our restaurant business model  we also provide culinary contract services for organizations that offer on site food service  such as health care facilities  colleges and universities  as well as businesses and institutions 
in fiscal years and  we continued to operate our two core brands  luby s cafeterias and fuddruckers  in the competitive fast casual segment of the restaurant industry 
much of our strategic focus centered around refining our prototype restaurant designs  exploring new avenues for revenue growth  re investing in our core restaurant models via remodel activity  and supporting our growth initiatives with various marketing techniques 
we also integrated the cheeseburger in paradise restaurants into our systems and processes 
we streamlined the menu and upgraded the quality  including an improved burger and bun 
as the integration progressed  we moved the cheeseburger in paradise locations into our consolidated purchasing network 
we have elevated the operations to a higher level of service by installing the right people guided by the right culture 
since the acquisition of fuddruckers  we have opened six fuddruckers franchise units  six new prototype company units and acquired four units from franchisees 
we have grown sales at our fuddruckers restaurants in each of the three full fiscal years since the acquisition 
we achieved this sales growth through a combination of local market outreach  upgrading the d cor at selected locations  and training our restaurant management and crews to achieve the highest level of customer service 
some specific local market outreach programs included partnering with local youth sporting teams  customer surveying  and further establishing relationships with other local businesses so that there is high awareness of the fuddruckers offerings among their employees and customers 
at our luby s cafeteria brand  we have been encouraged by the first two years of results of our newest location that opened at the end of fiscal year this was a location where we relocated from an in line shopping center to a newly constructed luby s prototype on a pad side in the parking lot 
the sales at this unit give us further confidence that the luby s cafeteria brand has broad appeal and generates solid cash flow returns with this prototype at the right location 
we followed up that project with development of a side by side luby s cafeteria and fuddruckers restaurant on a single parcel of land 
this development opened on the first day of fiscal year and has also provided us additional confidence that we are able to leverage our investment costs  offer our guests a wider range of options at one location  and achieve superior cash flow returns from new models 
this prototype is now a significant component of our near term growth strategy 
beginning in fiscal year and continuing through fiscal year  the luby s cafeteria brand also found solid success with growing the catering business  which includes large take out orders as well as delivery to a customer s location 
these catering efforts were expanded into the fuddruckers brand in fiscal where our capability continues to grow 
we continue menu development and innovation at both brands and rotate seasonal offerings throughout the year to generate interest and excitement at our restaurants 
our all you can eat breakfast buffet that we rolled out at a majority of our luby s cafeteria locations in fiscal year continued to contribute to our sales volume in fiscal year store level profit margin declined to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the inclusion of cheeseburger in paradise in our results for the portion of the year that we operated such restaurants reflected basis points of the decline in store level profit 
excluding the impact of cheeseburger in paradise  store level profit margin was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year  or a decline of basis points 
the decrease in store level profit margin resulted primarily from increases in expenses in the areas of food commodity costs  utility costs  and marketing investments and to a lesser degree from restaurant supplies and services 
while food commodity prices were relatively stable at our fuddrucker brand  we experienced an approximate increase in commodity prices at our luby cafeteria brand 
average customer spend increased at our luby s cafeteria restaurants and at our fuddruckers restaurants 
at the cafeteria locations  these increases were driven primarily by a change in menu mix and encouraging purchase of add on items  rather than menu item price increases 
at fuddruckers  these increases were achieved through a combination of highlighting specialty burgers on the menu boards  encouraging the purchase of add on menu items  reducing the level of discounting  and modest price increases on select menu items 
these increases in average customer spend  however  were offset by declines in guest traffic 
guest traffic at our luby s cafeteria restaurants declined and guest traffic at our fuddruckers restaurants declined 
our goal in fiscal year will continue to balance the trade off between customer growth and average customer spend 
our aim is always to increase customer frequency by marketing quality offerings and building long term brand loyalty and increased profitability 
capital spending increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this capital investment included the development of one relocated luby s cafeteria restaurant and six fuddruckers restaurants that we either developed  refurbished pre existing spaces  or purchased from franchisees 
in addition  at the end of fiscal year  we had an additional five restaurants under development with varying levels of capital committed 
we also invested capital for funding our remodeling program and recurring maintenance capital  including infrastructure projects  as well as for acquiring land for restaurant development projects 
we remain committed to maintaining the attractiveness of all of our restaurant locations where we anticipate operating over the long term 
in addition to these capital investments  we also invested million in cash plus customary working capital adjustments in fiscal year for the acquisition of the cheeseburger in paradise brand and its restaurant locations 
in fiscal year  we anticipate making capital investments of between million and million  primarily for construction of new restaurants with opening dates in fiscal year and early fiscal year  maintaining and remodeling of existing units  and purchases of property for restaurant development 
our capital expenditures and acquisition investment in fiscal year were funded through a combination of cash from operations  sale of property at locations that were closed as part of our cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan announced in october  and utilization of our revolving credit facility 
as a result  our debt balance at the end of fiscal year increased to compared to million at the end of fiscal year in august  we amended and restated our credit facility agreement with our bank group 
as part of the renewal terms  we have increased our line of credit from million to million  removed the annual capital expenditure limitation  and realized a slight reduction in the interest margin that we pay 
the renewal will provide for increased access to capital for growth  extending our credit facility from a previous maturity date of september  to a new maturity date of september  our debt balance at end of fiscal year represents of our total borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit 
fiscal year review same store sales at our restaurant units for fiscal year were unchanged compared to fiscal year same store sales comparisons for fiscal year to fiscal year were positive in our fiscal first and fourth quarters and negative in our second and third quarters 
the luby s cafeteria brand and fuddruckers brand each increased same store sales by for fiscal year compared to fiscal our two koo koo roo restaurants saw same store sales declines of for fiscal year compared to fiscal year income from continuing operations declined million from million  or per share  on million in total sales in fiscal year to million  or per share  on million in total sales in fiscal year this profitability decline was the result of declining store level profit defined as restaurant sales less food costs  payroll and related cost  other operating expenses  and occupancy costs  and the partial year negative impact of including cheeseburger in paradise results 
store level profit as a percentage of restaurant sales declined in fiscal year compared to fiscal year excluding the impact of cheeseburger in paradise from the financial results  store level profit  as a percentage of restaurant sales declined 
food costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year excluding the impact of cheeseburger in paradise  food costs as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the increase in food costs as a percentage of restaurant sales is due primarily to higher food commodity prices in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and lower food rebates in fiscal year compared to fiscal year payroll and related costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year excluding the impact of cheeseburger in paradise  payroll and related costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year payroll and related costs as a percentage of sales improved as crew labor costs decreased as result of better labor scheduling processes adopted during fiscal year and continued into fiscal year  including the ability to react more quickly to changes in customer traffic 
operating expenses  as percentage of restaurant sales  increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year excluding the impact of cheeseburger in paradise  operating expenses  as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the increase was due to significant increase in utilities and increased marketing spend  as well as increases in restaurant supply and service costs  partially offset by reductions in repairs and maintenance expenses 
occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year excluding the impact of cheeseburger in paradise  occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year depreciation expense increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to the addition of cheeseburger in paradise assets to the depreciable base 
the increase in depreciation due to investments made in new locations as well as the capital we have used for remodeling existing locations was mostly offset by certain existing assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives during fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased by million reflecting primarily the inclusion of cheeseburger in paradise into our operations 
interest expense was unchanged at million for both fiscal year and on similar average debt balances and interest rates 
income taxes in fiscal year included a valuation allowance release of million offset by an unrecognized tax benefit accrual of million 
our culinary contract services business generated million in revenue during fiscal year compared to million in revenue during fiscal year we view this area as a growth business that generally requires less capital investment and more favorable percentage returns on invested capital 
our long term plan continues to focus on expanding each of our brands  including the fuddruckers franchise network  as well as growing our culinary contract services business 
we are also committed to making capital investments with suitable return characteristics 
we plan to use cash generated from operations combined with our borrowing capacity when necessary in order to seize these capital investment opportunities 
we believe our operational execution has improved through our commitment to higher operating standards  and we believe that we are well positioned to enhance shareholder value over the long term 
accounting periods our fiscal year ends on the last wednesday in august 
accordingly  each fiscal year normally consists of four week periods  or accounting periods  accounting for days in the aggregate 
however  every fifth or sixth year  we have a fiscal year that consists of weeks  accounting for days in the aggregate  fiscal year was such a year 
each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four week periods  while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four week periods 
however  the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as a result of the additional week  consisted of three four week periods and one five week period  accounting for weeks  or days  in the aggregate 
fiscal years and both contained weeks 
comparability between quarters may be affected by the varying lengths of the quarters  as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant business 
same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service  all of which may have an effect on same store sales 
our same store sales calculation measures the relative performance of a certain group of restaurants 
to qualify for inclusion in this group  a store must have been in operation for consecutive accounting periods the fuddruckers units that were acquired in july were included in the same store grouping beginning with the third quarter of fiscal year the cheeseburger in paradise stores that were acquired in december will be included in the same store metric beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year stores that close on a permanent basis are removed from the group in the fiscal quarter when operations cease at the restaurant  but remain in the same store group for previously reported fiscal quarters 
although management believes this approach leads to more effective year over year comparisons  neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant companies 
same store sales at our restaurant units were unchanged for fiscal year  increased for fiscal year  and increased for fiscal year the following table shows the same store sales change for comparative historical quarters fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year increase decrease q q q q q q q q q q q q same store sales discontinued operations our cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan approved in fiscal year called for the closure of underperforming units 
in accordance with the plan  the entire fiscal activity of the applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan has been classified as discontinued operations 
results related to these same locations have also been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
classification of expenses on the statement of operations beginning with fiscal year  we began classifying restaurant group health insurance expenses in our payroll and related expense line item where previously these expenses were classified in our other operating expense line item 
we have also reclassified the expense associated with matching employee k contributions and certain employee meal benefits from our other operating expense line to our payroll and related expense line 
fiscal year and all previously reported periods reflect this re classification 
we believe this presentation provides more comparability with a number of other restaurant companies 
in addition  we have included a separate expense line item for occupancy costs 
these costs which include restaurant property lease expenses  property taxes  and common area maintenance charges were previously included within our other operating expense line item 
fiscal year and all previously reported periods reflect this reclassification 
we believe this presentation provides more comparability with a number of other restaurant companies and is more informative 
these changes have no impact on our reported store level profit defined as restaurant sales less cost of food less payroll and related costs  less other operating costs  less occupancy costs 
results of operations fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks sales total company sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  consisting primarily of a million increase in restaurant sales  offset by a million decrease in culinary contract services sales  a million decrease in franchise revenue  and a million decrease in vending income

company owned restaurants restaurant sales restaurant sales increased approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in restaurant sales included a million contribution from the cheeseburger in paradise restaurants  a million increase in sales at luby s cafeteria branded restaurants and a million increase in sales from fuddruckers branded restaurants offset by a million decrease in koo koo roo branded restaurants 
on a same store basis  restaurant sales were unchanged for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the unchanged same store sales level is primarily due to a continued very competitive operating environment and greater levels of economic uncertainty 
maintaining our level of same store sales was achieved by growth in certain areas of our business  such as catering orders  remodeled restaurants  and in certain geographical markets where we have been able to grow sales  as well as through sustained marketing efforts 
these areas of sales growth were offset by other markets where sales growth proved more challenging 
cost of food food costs increased approximately million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to the addition of new restaurants  including cheeseburger in paradise branded stores

food commodity costs at our cafeteria restaurants were higher across all product categories except for oils and shortenings 
the basket of food commodity purchases at fuddruckers branded restaurants was stable in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as higher commodity prices for poultry  buns  and produce were completely offset by the modest price decreases in our core beef products

discontinued operations the loss or income from discontinued operations was a million loss in fiscal year compared to income of million in fiscal year the loss of million in fiscal year included million in carrying costs typically rent  property taxes  utilities  and maintenance associated with assets that were related to discontinued operations  impairment charges of million for certain assets related to discontinued operations  offset by million in gains on sales of assets related to discontinued assets and a million income tax benefit related to discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents general 
our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents increased million as of fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million was offset by cash used in investing activities of million 
cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by increased total revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year but unfavorably impacted by increased cost of food  payroll and related costs  occupancy costs and other operating costs 
we increased our net borrowings from our revolving credit facility in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to the purchase of cheeseburger in paradise 
we also increased our capital expenditures and we plan to continue the level of capital expenditures necessary to keep our restaurants attractive and operating efficiently 
cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by increased total revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and by significant improvements in cost of food  payroll and related costs and other operating costs

cash and cash equivalents remained flat as of fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end cash provided by operating activities of million was offset by cash used in financing activities of million and cash used in investing activities of million 
our cash requirements consisted principally of payments to reduce our debt the acquisition of cheeseburger in paradise  capital expenditures for culinary contract services development and construction  restaurant renovations and upgrades and information technology  and working capital primarily for our company owned restaurants and culinary contract services agreements 
based upon our level of past and projected capital requirements  we expect that proceeds from the sale of assets and cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the next twelve months 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
however  higher levels of accounts receivable are typical for culinary contract services and franchises 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets

a number of these lawsuits  proceedings and claims may exist at any given time 
these matters typically involve claims from guests  employees and others related to issues common to the restaurant industry 
we currently believe that the final disposition of these types of lawsuits  proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
it is possible  however  that our future results of operations for a particular quarter or fiscal year could be impacted by changes in circumstances relating to lawsuits  proceedings or claims 
construction activity from time to time  we enter into non cancelable contracts for the construction of our new restaurants 
this construction activity exposes us to the risks inherent in new construction including but not limited to rising material prices  labor shortages  delays in getting required permits and inspections  adverse weather conditions  and injuries sustained by workers

pappas  who is a director of luby s  inc critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies due to the significant  subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly reviews these assumptions and estimates with the finance and audit committee of our board of directors 
income taxes the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are recorded 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically review the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
if the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a net deferred tax asset  management will evaluate the probability of our ability to realize the future benefits of such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of such net deferred tax asset will generally depend on whether we will have sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character within the carryforward period permitted by the tax law 
at the end of fiscal year  the company had total deferred tax assets of approximately million 
however  based on management s analysis of whether it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million was necessary at the end of fiscal year the decision was based on the large loss sustained from continuing operations for the year  the closure of many underperforming restaurants  and the tax net operating loss reported on the company s current year and prior year federal income tax returns 
even though management had implemented a plan to improve cash flow and redeploy capital  the circumstances did not provide evidence that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
therefore  a valuation allowance was established to partially offset the company s federal net operating loss nol carryovers to future years and the company s carryover of federal general business tax credits 
at the end of fiscal year  total deferred tax assets were approximately million 
management reviewed the positive and negative evidence to determine whether these deferred tax assets would more likely than not be realized 
the negative evidence was that again the company experienced a loss from continuing operations and would report a net operating loss for federal income taxes 
on the positive side  however  the loss for the year was significantly less than in the prior year and expectations were that the improvements would continue as a result of the closure of certain underperforming restaurants 
also  the company acquired substantially all the assets of fuddruckers at the end of fiscal year with expectations of additional operational income in the future 
management incorporated these factors into projections of future taxable income but could not determine that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized over the projection period 
a valuation allowance was still necessary but not in the same amount as the previous year 
management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million at august  was necessary 
the valuation allowance partially offset our nol carryovers to future years and our carryover of federal general business tax credits and other credits 
the reduction of the valuation allowance from august  was reported as part of the tax benefit included in income loss from continuing operations for fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  total deferred tax assets were approximately million 
management reviewed the positive and negative evidence to determine whether these deferred tax assets would be realized 
on the negative side  the company reported a net operating loss on the federal income tax return of million 
the positive evidence was that the company earned income from continuing operations for the year 
this was a significant improvement over the last two years and indicates the company s cash flow and capital redeployment plan may be working 
even though there were losses in the two prior years  management is more confident that the integration of fuddruckers and improvements in other operations will provide future revenue to allow the utilization of the deferred tax assets 
management incorporated these factors into projections of future taxable income but could not determine at the end of fiscal year that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized over the projection period 
a valuation allowance was still necessary but not in the same amount as the previous year 
management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million at august  was necessary at the end of fiscal year the valuation allowance partially offsets our carryover of federal general business tax credits 
the reduction of the valuation allowance from august  is reported as part of the tax expense included in income loss from continuing operations for fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  total deferred tax assets were approximately million 
management reviewed the positive and negative evidence to determine whether these deferred tax assets would be realized 
on the negative side  the company has federal income tax nol carryovers of approximately million  tax effected  and general business credit and foreign tax credit carryovers of approximately million  which will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year and  respectively  if not utilized by then 
on the positive side  the company earned income from continuing operations for fiscal year and had cumulative income from continuing operations for the combined three years ending in fiscal year additionally  the company reported net taxable income on the fiscal year federal income tax return of approximately million  before the utilization of nol carryovers 
further  management forecasted the company s future operational performance and taxable income  adjusted by varying probability factors  and anticipated that all of its federal nol carryovers and general business tax carryovers would be fully realized within five years 
this was a significant improvement and indicated the company s cash flow and capital redeployment plan was working 
management was confident that the integration of fuddruckers and improvements in other operations would provide sufficient future revenue to allow the utilization of the deferred tax assets 
management incorporated these factors into its evaluation of the realization the deferred tax assets  and determined that it would more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized  such that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary 
management concluded that the valuation allowance of approximately million should be removed as of the end of fiscal year the reduction of the valuation allowance is reported as part of the net tax expense included in income loss from continuing operations for fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  total deferred tax assets were approximately million 
management reviewed the positive and negative evidence to determine whether these deferred tax assets would be realized 
on the negative side  the company has federal income tax nol carryovers of approximately million  tax effected  and general business credit and foreign tax credit carryovers of approximately million  which will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year and  respectively  if not utilized by then 
on the positive side  the company earned income from continuing operations for fiscal year and has cumulative income from continuing operations for the combined three years ended in fiscal year additionally  the company is estimated to report net taxable income on the fiscal year federal income tax return of approximately million  before the utilization of nol carryovers 
further  management has forecasted the company s future operational performance and taxable income  adjusted by varying probability factors  and anticipates that all of its federal nol carryovers and general business tax carryovers will be fully realized within five years 
management incorporated these factors into its evaluation of the realization the deferred tax assets  and has determined that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  such that a valuation allowance is not currently necessary 
two of the most significant items included in deferred tax assets are nol carryovers and general business tax credits 
both of these items may be carried over up to twenty years in the future for possible utilization in the future 
nol carryover amounts began in fiscal year and will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year through fiscal year  if not utilized by then 
the carryover of general business tax credits and other credits were also impacted by amended federal returns  and subsequent to these filings  general business tax credit amounts carryover beginning in fiscal year and will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year through  if not utilized by then 
the valuation allowance amounts as of fiscal year and partially offset our nol carryovers to future years and our carryover of general business tax credits 
the valuation allowance as of fiscal year partially offset only our carryover of general business tax credits since a valuation allowance on our nol carryovers was no longer necessary  as these assets were more likely than not to be fully realized 
considering continuing operational performance and forecasted taxable income projections  management anticipated the nol carryovers as of the end of fiscal year to be realized within five years subsequent 
the reversals of the valuation allowance amounts in fiscal years  and were based upon continued improvement in current and projected operational performance  ability to utilize nol amounts through carryforward and carryback  as well as a declining sustained loss from continuing operations in fiscal year relative to the prior year  and increasing income from continuing operations in fiscal years and this positive and negative evidence was weighed  and in each year an increasing portion of our deferred tax assets was determined to be realizable  on a more likely than not basis  with corresponding adjustments to the valuation allowance 
the reductions of the valuation allowance in fiscal years  and are reported as part of the income tax expense or benefit included in income loss from continuing operations for the year 
management makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to examination in these tax jurisdictions  as well as by the internal revenue service irs 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all open income tax periods 
the potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes and income tax liabilities 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
tangible property regulations in september  the us treasury issued final regulations addressing the tax consequences associated with the acquisition  production and improvement of tangible property and which are generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after january   which for the company is its year beginning august  the company plans to timely adopt these regulations and  at this time  has not evaluated the impact of these regulations on its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets held for use and held for sale  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
we analyze historical cash flows of operating locations and compare results of poorer performing locations to more profitable locations 
we also analyze lease terms  condition of the assets and related need for capital expenditures or repairs  construction activity in the surrounding area as well as the economic and market conditions in the surrounding area 
for assets held for use  we estimate future cash flows using assumptions based on possible outcomes of the areas analyzed 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of our location s assets  we record an impairment based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
assumptions and estimates used include operating results  changes in working capital  discount rate  growth rate  anticipated net proceeds from disposition of the property and if applicable  lease terms 
the span of time for which future cash flows are estimated is often lengthy  increasing the sensitivity to assumptions made 
the time span is longer and could be to years for newer properties  but only to years for older properties 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash flows 
we operated restaurants as of november  and periodically experience unanticipated changes in our assumptions and estimates 
those changes could have a significant impact on discounted cash flow models with a corresponding significant impact on the measurement of an impairment 
gains are not recognized until the assets are disposed 
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets  primarily the fuddruckers trademarks and franchise agreements to determine if they are definite or indefinite lived 
reaching a determination of useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  contract term  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets  primarily the fuddruckers trademarks and franchise agreements  to determine if events or changes in circumstances such as economic or market conditions indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we analyze historical cash flows of operating locations to determine trends that would indicate a need for impairment 
we also analyze royalties and collectability from our franchisees to determine if there are trends that would indicate a need for impairment 
property held for sale we periodically review long lived assets against our plans to retain or ultimately dispose of properties 
if we decide to dispose of a property  it will be moved to property held for sale and actively marketed 
property held for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently expects to receive upon sale  less costs of disposal 
we analyze market conditions each reporting period and record additional impairments due to declines in market values of like assets 
the fair value of the property is determined by observable inputs such as appraisals and prices of comparable properties in active markets for assets like ours 
gains are not recognized until the properties are sold 
insurance and claims we self insure a significant portion of risks and associated liabilities under our employee injury  workers compensation and general liability programs 
we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers to limit our per occurrence claim exposure 
we have recorded accrued liabilities for self insurance based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and we review these amounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
the significant assumptions made by the actuary to estimate self insurance reserves  including incurred but not reported claims  are as follows historical patterns of loss development will continue in the future as they have in the past loss development method  historical trend patterns and loss cost levels will continue in the future as they have in the past bornhuetter ferguson method  and historical claim counts and exposures are used to calculate historical frequency rates and average claim costs are analyzed to get a projected severity frequency and severity method 
the results of these methods are blended by the actuary to provide the reserves estimates 
actual workers compensation and employee injury claims expense may differ from estimated loss provisions 
the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program are not known  and declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experiences or reductions in reserve requirements under the program may not continue in future periods 
share based compensation share based compensation is recognized as compensation expense in the income statement utilizing the fair value on the date of the grant 
the fair value of restricted stock units is valued at the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
assumptions for volatility  expected option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield are used in the model 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment topic 
this pronouncement was issued to simplify how entities test for impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
under this pronouncement  an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
in conclusion of this assessment  if an entity finds that it is not more likely that not than an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  is an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other

inflation it is generally our policy to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations in food costs 
certain increases in costs of food  wages  supplies  transportation and services may require us to increase our menu prices from time to time 
to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  we intend to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting our variable rate debt 
as of fiscal year end  the total amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations outstanding under our amended new credit facility was million 
assuming an average debt balance of million  a increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by million 
although we are not currently using interest rate swaps  we have previously used and may in the future use these instruments to manage cash flow risk on a portion of our variable rate debt 
many ingredients in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities  subject to unpredictable price fluctuations 
we attempt to minimize price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients and in some cases by passing increased commodity costs through to the customer by adjusting menu prices or menu offerings 
our ingredients are available from multiple suppliers so we are not dependant on a single vendor for our ingredients
