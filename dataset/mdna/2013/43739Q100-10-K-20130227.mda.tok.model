overview we operate the world s largest online marketplace for the vacation rental industry 
our marketplace brings together millions of travelers seeking vacation rentals online with hundreds of thousands of property owners and managers of vacation rental properties located in countries around the world 
our portfolio includes leading vacation rental websites in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  france  spain  brazil and australia 
during  according to our internal metrics  our websites attracted approximately million website visits  and as of december   our global marketplace included more than  paid listings 
in  consistent with our stated strategy  we focused our efforts on providing the largest selection of properties to travelers and the most qualified inquiries to property owners and managers 
we added  paid listings  net of non renewals  to our network during  representing an growth rate over the prior year 
during the third quarter  we completed the platform consolidation of adding vrbo 
com to our global technology platform  which we believe will provide a better experience for property owners and managers and travelers 
following this platform consolidation  with a majority of our global inventory on our core platform  we began selling new us and global bundled listing products and added vrbo 
com to our tiered pricing structure 
consistent with providing the largest selection of properties to travelers  we also expanded our network during as a result of our acquisition of top rural sl toprural in spain 
toprural added approximately  paid listings to our network  further solidifying our market presence in spain and southern europe 
we continued to improve monetization of our listing base from pricing and product changes 
we benefited from the introduction of a new tiered pricing structure in on homeaway 
com 
during the third quarter of  this tiered pricing structure was launched on vrbo 
com  and during the fourth quarter of  we launched the structure on homeaway 
co 
uk in the united kingdom  abritel 
fr in france and homeaway 
de in germany 
tiered pricing is available to new and renewing property owners and managers on these websites 
it allows them to improve their position in search results by purchasing a higher subscription level or tier 
we believe property owners and managers increasingly will elect to purchase higher tiers  which would increase overall average revenue per listing in future periods 
at the same time  by keeping base prices low  we believe the number of paid listings can continue to grow 
although we plan to launch tiered pricing on our other websites as well  we may use different strategies as we enter new markets and geographies or attempt to further penetrate the professional property manager market 
despite the negative impacts of foreign exchange rates  average revenue per listing for the full year increased by in  compared to  primarily as a result of the positive impact of tiered pricing 
average revenue per subscription listing  excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and lower revenue per listing for pay for performance listings  grew for the full year as compared to enablement of e commerce on our websites has been and will continue to be a focus for our company 
in  we continued the rollout and enhancement of our online payments platform  called reservationmanager  which was originally launched in reservationmanager enables property owners and managers to respond to and manage inquiries  prepare and send rental quotes and payment invoices  allows travelers to book online  including the ability to enter into rental agreements online  and process online payments via credit card or echeck 
additionally  through reservationmanager  property owners and managers can make value added products such as property damage protection available for purchase 
reservationmanager is currently available

we believe that adoption of this product over time will allow us to earn more revenue from ancillary products while providing a more secure payment mechanism for travelers 
we plan to introduce new products and services for travelers  property owners and managers  which we believe will provide further opportunities to generate revenue through our marketplace 
we believe that bringing travelers to our online marketplace is necessary to attract and retain vacation rental owners and managers 
it is also critical for us to increase the rates at which travelers inquire about renting and book vacation rentals with our property owners and managers 
to meet these challenges  we are focused on a combination of marketing tactics  including pay per click advertising  search engine optimization  and display advertising  with a goal of driving visits to our websites as well as increasing the exposure of the vacation rental category 
we are also investing in product enhancements to make it easier for travelers visiting our websites to search and find the right property  to inquire and to book their stay 
consistent with this strategy  during the third quarter of  we launched online booking functionality on homeaway 
com and vrbo 
com  and during the fourth quarter of  launched this functionality on homeaway 
co 
uk in the united kingdom  abritel 
fr in france and homeaway 
de in germany 
online booking enables travelers to reserve a vacation rental directly on any of our listing websites that utilize our reservationmanager payments platform  rather than requiring correspondence with a property owner or manager to reserve a vacation rental 
key financial highlights we have achieved significant growth since our commercial launch in our revenue growth is attributable to our acquisitions of other online listings businesses  the organic growth in the number of listings that property owners and managers purchase from us  increases in the average revenue we receive per listing due to additional features and price increases  and the introduction of additional products and services related to our marketplace 
we view our market opportunity as global and have historically generated strong cash flows 
additionally  we have had predictable financial results because of our advance payment  subscription based model and our high annual listing renewal rates 
key financial highlights for include the following total revenue was million compared to million in  or an increase of  with the increase being negatively impacted by declining foreign exchange rates  excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates  total revenue increased by  percentage of total revenue coming from outside the united states was in  compared to in  and in included from europe and from brazil and australia  listing revenue was million compared to million in and contributed of total revenue compared to in  net income was million compared to million in  or an increase of  cash from operating activities was million compared to million in  or an increase of  which includes a negative impact from an excess tax benefit as a result of stock based compensation of million in  compared to million in  adjusted ebitda was million compared to million in  or an increase of  as a percentage of revenue  adjusted ebitda was free cash flow was million compared to million in  or an increase of  pro forma net income was million  or per diluted share  compared to pro forma net income of million  or per diluted share in  and cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  were million 

table of contents for further discussion regarding adjusted ebitda  free cash flow and pro forma net income  along with reconciliations of such numbers to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  please see the information under the caption selected financial data in item of this annual report on form k 
acquisitions since our inception  we have acquired businesses as part of our growth strategy 
each of these acquisitions has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting 
accordingly  the financial statements for these businesses have been included in our consolidated financial results since the applicable acquisition dates 
the most recent acquisition was in april  when we acquired toprural in spain 
this acquisition further solidified our market presence in spain and southern europe and extended our reach to a desirable european traveler segment that seeks long weekend holidays to small towns or countryside destinations 
our acquisitions have presented  and certain of them continue to present  significant integration challenges 
they have required us to integrate new operations  offices and employees and to formulate and execute on marketing  product and technology strategies associated with the acquired businesses 
in some cases  we continue to manage multiple brands and technology platforms of the acquired businesses  which has increased our cost of operations 
challenges of this nature are likely to arise if we acquire businesses in the future 
growth opportunities and trends our ability to continue to grow our revenue will depend largely on increasing the number of paid listings  increasing revenue per listing and increasing other revenue from other products and services through our marketplace 
this includes our ability to successfully enable e commerce transactions on our websites  including allowing for online payments and online booking  and commission based revenue streams for vacation rental listings through the launch of pay per booking listings 
we continually assess opportunities for strategic acquisitions 
we also use direct and indirect marketing as well as telesales to reach owners and professional property managers 
we believe that the growing awareness of vacation rentals  as a favorable alternative to hotels  has and will continue to support growth of our business 
we continue to monitor the weakened economic environment in europe and the corresponding impact on our business 
we have continued to see stronger and accelerating traffic trends from european travelers in every european region in which we operate 
specifically  year over year traffic growth rates accelerated during the second half of in all european regions in which we operate as compared to year over year traffic growth rates in the first half of we believe that our ability to deliver high quality inquiries to our customers in spite of the broader economic challenges in europe will help mitigate any negative visit trends to our websites 
additionally  we continue to monitor foreign exchange rates as declining foreign exchange rates will negatively impact our results given that of our revenue is generated in europe 
expenses our expenses are primarily composed of salaries and related expenses  marketing and professional fees 
our expenses from year to year may fluctuate due to timing of specific events or projects 
we will continue to increase expenses across the organization on an annual basis to support our growth and expect our cost of revenue to grow slightly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in we expect to incur higher expenses for product development as we record a full year impact of personnel hired in and as we hire additional personnel to develop new features and products and expect product development expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue in we expect to incur higher expenses for sales and marketing as we continue to build our sales team to address the professional property managers and continue to build brand and category awareness  but expect sales and marketing expenses to decline slightly as a percentage of revenue in we 
table of contents expect to incur higher expenses for general and administrative expenses to support the growth of our business and the requirements of being a publicly traded company  but expect general and administrative expenses to remain consistent as a percentage of revenue in we plan for additional capital investments in to support the growth of our business  but expect our investment in capital expenditures to remain consistent as a percentage of revenue as compared to we believe that reorganizing our global corporate structure will lower our tax expense over the longer term 
key business metrics in addition to traditional financial and operational metrics  we use the following business metrics to monitor and evaluate results 
year ended december  paid listings  end of period average revenue per listing renewal rate  end of period visits to websites in millions paid listings 
in  and   and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from paid listings 
we regularly track paid listings as a key revenue growth indicator and to identify trends in our business and industry 
from to and from to  ending paid listings increased by and  respectively  contributing to listing revenue growth of and  respectively 
the growth in paid listings continued to be due to our marketing and selling new and additional listings to professional property managers  as well as organic growth from property owners and managers who become aware of our websites and choose to market their properties 
growth in paid listings is also impacted by listings acquired in business combinations 
growth in new listings is partially offset by loss of listings through attrition 
as the number of paid listings increases  we believe that we will generate additional revenue while also expanding the value of the marketplace to travelers  thus increasing the likelihood that travelers will find a property that is suitable to their needs 
we define a paid listing as a fee to list a property advertisement on one or more websites in our marketplace 
a paid listing allows a property owner or manager to include a description of the property  along with location  pricing  availability  a specified number of photos and contact information 
we also provide tools to enable them to manage their listings and rental business 
most listings are sold on a subscription basis  and some listing packages may include listings on more than one of our websites 
we also sell listings on a pay for performance basis to property managers 
when purchased at the same time in one bundle  we count this as one paid listing 
following the migration of vrbo 
com to our global technology platform in  property owners and managers that have listings on both homeaway 
com and vrbo 
com are able to consolidate their listings into one listing that is displayed on both websites 
additionally  the platform consolidation allows property owners and managers to purchase bundled listings that include display on both homeaway 
com and vrbo 
com 
as a result  we now count these bundled listings as one listing 
this will lower our paid listing counts since these previously would have been counted as two listings had they been purchased on both websites 
in the future  as property owners and managers that have listings on both homeaway 
com and vrbo 
com renew their subscriptions into a bundled listing  we will count these as one listing 
we anticipate more bundled listings and consolidations of listings in the future  which we expect will lower our paid listing growth as compared to historical levels 
we do not expect these changes to have any negative impact on the number of unique properties on our websites 
it is possible that a specific property may be listed on more than one of our websites without indicating that the multiple listings refer to the same property 
we have used various technologies to estimate the number of 
table of contents unique properties and are implementing systems and processes to identify the number of unique properties that comprise our paid vacation rental listings  which we estimate was approximately  as of december   as compared to approximately  as of december  average revenue per listing 
we believe that trends in revenue per listing  over an extended period  are important to understanding the value we bring to property owners and managers  and the overall health of our marketplace 
we use trends in revenue per listing  as well as trends in paid listings  in order to formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions 
at a consolidated level  increases in revenue per listing may increase our earnings or may be leveraged for future investment 
the average revenue per listing may fluctuate based on the timing and nature of acquisitions  changes in our pricing  uptake of listing enhancements  changes in the pricing of enhancements  changes in brand and listing type mix  and the impact of foreign exchange rates on our listing revenue outside of the united states 
from to and from to  average revenue per listing increased by and  respectively  which contributed to our overall listing revenue growth 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates  average revenue per listing increased and from to and from to  respectively 
average revenue per listing for subscriptions only  excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and lower revenue per listing for pay for performance listings  grew in as compared to we compute average revenue per listing as annualized listing revenue divided by the average of paid listings at the beginning and end of the period 
our paid listings include both subscription listings and pay for performance listings to professional property managers 
average revenue per listing may be impacted by changes in mix between listing types  with pay for performance listings generally having a dilutive effect on average revenue per listing 
the price of listings varies by website and can include various additional fees associated with listing enhancements 
we have traditionally relied on increases in base pricing to increase revenue per listing but are now focused on tiered pricing alternatives as well as bundled listings for our property owners and managers which may or may not include increases in our base price 
we began offering tiered pricing on homeaway 
com in the united states in  which allows our property owners and managers to purchase a higher subscription level to increase the position of their listings in search results 
in  we migrated vrbo 
com in the united states to the same tiered pricing structure 
also in  we launched tiered pricing on homeaway 
com 
uk in the united kingdom  abritel 
fr in france and homeaway 
de in germany 
as we continue to implement tiered pricing on other websites  or change the prices or structure of tiered pricing  we may see an impact to listing sales in the current period with the impact on revenue seen over the length of the subscription period 
our average revenue per listing in was impacted by our property owners and managers ability to consolidate their listings in the us and their ability to purchase bundled listing products 
as noted in our discussion on paid listings above  consolidated listings and bundled listings will lower our number of paid listings  which in turn will increase our average revenue per listing 
additionally  our bundled listing products generally have a higher base price 
adjusting for the impact of consolidated listings and new bundled listings on the number of paid listings in the us  our average revenue per listing would have been in  or an increase of 
excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and lower revenue per listing for pay for performance listings  and adjusting for the impact of consolidated listings and new bundled listings in the us  our average revenue per listing would have been in as compared to in  or an increase of 
renewal rate 
renewal of paid subscription listings is a key driver of revenue for our business 
also  we track renewal rate in order to understand and improve upon the satisfaction of our property owners and managers and to help us more accurately estimate our future revenue and cash flows 
while our overall renewal rate decreased from in to in following an increase in our renewal rates from in 
table of contents to in  renewal rates vary among our websites and can fluctuate due to a variety of factors  including customer satisfaction  changes in our processes associated with renewal activity  such as the introduction of automatic renewal  and general market conditions 
the decrease in our renewal rate in as compared to is primarily due to the inclusion of our australian site  homeaway 
com 
au  in the calculation for  and declines in the renewal rates from our european brands as a result of continued difficult economic conditions in europe 
specifically  renewal rates at abritel 
fr  one of our french websites  were significantly lower in due to the migration of abritel 
fr to our global technology platform in the third quarter of  which resulted in a change in renewal options for property owners and managers 
additionally  contributing to the decline in renewal rates in was the removal of listings for a large single account in the united kingdom due to quality and performance concerns associated with the listings  declines seen as a result of substantial product changes made during on vrbo 
com in the united states  and lower first year renewal rates on paid listings that were originally purchased at lower prices as part of our growing promotional efforts 
we expect continued product improvements  demand generation for property owners and managers and the resulting increases in customer satisfaction to result in long term improvements to renewal rates 
our renewal rate was impacted and will be impacted in the future  by our property owners and managers ability to consolidate their listings in the us and their ability to purchase geographic bundled listings 
adjusting for this impact  our renewal rate was in  or a decrease of as compared to the renewal rate for our subscription listings at the end of any period is defined as the percentage of those paid listings that were active at the end of the period ended twelve months prior that are still active as of the end of the reported period 
we include most brands in our calculation of renewal rate 
however  subscriptions to bedandbreakfast 
com and toprural 
com remain excluded until we can further develop our database system 
however  based on our review of other internal renewal rate data  we do not believe that the exclusion of these brands from the renewal rate calculation materially impacts the result 
property owners and managers satisfaction with our solutions is the primary driver of our renewal rate 
we believe that property owners and managers measure their satisfaction with our websites based largely on the number of inquiries and rental bookings that they receive from travelers 
when the underlying vacation properties are sold or taken off the market  the owner or manager has no further need for the listings  and this attrition is a natural and ongoing component of non renewal of listings 
we exclude pay for performance listings from our renewal rate analysis since they are not sold on a subscription basis 
visits to websites 
we view visits to websites as a key indicator of growth in our brand awareness among users and our ability to provide our property owners and managers with inquiries from travelers 
growth in visits to websites will be driven by our marketing strategies and has an indirect impact on our financial performance 
we use a variety of tools to measure visits to our websites 
these tools include solutions from third parties such as omniture and google analytics 
we also review third party published reports to measure our results against comparable companies  however  these reports are not consistent with our internal measurements 
growth in visits in was as compared to and was in as compared to during the fourth quarter of  we began using a different tool for the measurement of visits for certain of our websites 
on a comparable basis  we estimate that visits would have increased by and year over year in and  respectively  if we had been using the same tools during both reporting periods 
key components of our results of operations revenue we derive most of our revenue from paid listings from our property owners and managers 
our customers generally pay for their listings at the beginning of the listing term  and revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the listing  which is generally one year 
we offer pay for performance listings to professional managers  which represented of our revenue in both and  respectively 
this offering is generally taken 
table of contents when a property manager has a marketing budget that is allocated over many managed properties 
they can elect to list more properties and pay us each month for the number of inquiries that are generated 
a major source of new property listings has been through the use of our inside sales organization who target larger professional managers 
we also generate new listings from search engines such as google  where property owners and managers search to find vacation rental listings websites 
in addition  word of mouth referrals  primarily from existing property owners and managers that have been successful in renting their vacation rentals or travelers who have been successful in finding a property to rent using our websites  are another source for new listings 
we believe that in order to grow our revenue in the future  it will be important to introduce new features and functionality for our property owners and managers  allowing us to keep prices low while offering expanded distribution and search placement for additional fees 
it will also be important for us to continually improve the functionality of our websites to attract a large audience of travelers to help ensure our property owners and managers receive sufficient inquiries and bookings 
deferred revenue consists of payments received from sales of listings in excess of the revenue that we have recognized from the same listings  sales from hosted software solutions for which the estimated period of the hosting relationship is longer than one year and sales of gift cards for which revenue is recognized over a period commensurate with the use of the gift card 
deferred revenue increases as a result of new listings and decreases as a result of the recognition each month of the pro rata share of revenue from cash collected in previous periods 
we expect an increase in deferred revenue on an annual basis as we grow our core listing business  but may experience seasonal decreases in deferred revenue in quarters with fewer new listings and renewals  as is discussed in more detail in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly results section of this annual report on form k 
as with other balance sheet line items  deferred revenue is reflected at the current month end exchange rate  and the change in deferred revenue may therefore be impacted by movements in foreign currency 
we earn revenue from the sales of internet display based advertising on our websites  property management software licenses and related maintenance  gift cards and commissions for online reservations 
we also offer other services to property owners  managers and travelers that result in revenue and royalties 
costs and expenses a large component of our costs and expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs include salaries  benefits  bonuses and related expenses  including stock based compensation 
we grew from employees at december  to  employees at december  we expect that personnel costs will be higher in absolute dollars in than in based on an expected increase in the number of employees in cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists of customer service personnel and web hosting personnel costs  merchant fees charged by credit card processors  costs associated with the hosting of our websites  costs associated with payments and reserves under our carefree rental guarantee and depreciation costs 
personnel costs include salaries  benefits  bonuses and related expenses  including stock based compensation 
to the extent that the number of paid listings on our marketplace grows and as we add more features to our websites  we intend to invest additional resources in customer service systems and personnel 
our customer service personnel help our property owners and managers use our websites to list their properties  answer their questions  and perform listing reviews and other processes as a part of our efforts to ensure quality  trust and security 
our customer service personnel also help travelers use our websites to book their travel and answer their questions 
our merchant fees are based on a contractual rate per transaction and will increase in absolute dollars as sales of listings increase  but for we expect our merchant fees to remain relatively constant and commensurate with levels  as a percentage of revenue 
in general  as we add more features and functionality to our websites and anticipate an increase in the number of travelers accessing our websites  we will increase our spending on 
table of contents hardware and software required for hosting 
we expect these additional costs to cause our cost of revenue expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in as compared to we view the operation of our websites as a foundation upon which different revenue streams are generated 
cost of revenue  as described above  which includes the cost of customer service personnel  web hosting and merchant fees  directly supports our listing revenue  which was and of total revenue in and  respectively 
these same expenses support the overall operation of our websites and therefore our other revenue 
there are no other material distinct costs of revenue for any period presented 
the reporting of cost of revenue as one category in our consolidated financial statements is consistent with the manner in which we manage our business 
product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  third party contracting and consulting fees associated with our research and development of new services  expenses associated with improvements to  and maintenance of  existing services  and depreciation 
we have historically focused our product development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our websites  both for property owners and managers and for travelers 
we intend to increase our technology and product resources by hiring additional personnel in future periods as we anticipate an increase in the number of listings and develop new features and products 
we expect these additional investments to cause our product development expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in as compared to sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of amounts paid for pay per click  or ppc  online advertising  broad reach advertising  personnel costs for our marketing  search engine optimization  or seo  sales staff  and consulting and other services firms fees  expenses associated with email marketing programs  and public relations expenses and depreciation 
we utilize ppc advertising primarily to increase the number of travelers to our websites who are seeking properties in specific geographical areas in order to increase the number of inquiries regarding vacation rentals 
our sales and marketing team also focuses on increasing the placement of our websites in search rankings on google  bing and other search engines  which results in owner  manager and traveler acquisition at relatively little incremental expense 
we intend to significantly increase our sales expense to drive additional listing sales to professional property managers and increase marketing efforts to support our new products  increase the traffic to our websites and increase overall brand awareness 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars  but decline slightly as a percentage of revenue in as compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for our executive  finance and accounting  and management information systems personnel  professional fees for legal  audit  and other consulting services  allocated facility expenses  depreciation and other corporate overhead expenses 
we expect to increase headcount to support our anticipated growth  which will result in an increase in other expenses  such as facilities  office and travel 
we also expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company  including increases in our finance  accounting and legal personnel  additional consulting  legal and audit fees  insurance costs  board of directors compensation  and costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and other requirements 
as a result  we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars but remain flat or decline slightly as a percentage of revenue in as compared to depreciation property and equipment  office tenant improvements and software licenses are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
equipment and computer hardware are depreciated over three years and furniture and fixtures over five to ten years 
leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the shorter of the contractual lease period or their useful life 
we allocate 
table of contents depreciation to expense categories based on the relative number of employees in each category 
based on our current estimated level of capital expenditures  we expect our depreciation expense to increase in absolute dollars but to remain relatively stable as a percentage of revenue in as compared to amortization due to our historical acquisitions  we have recorded identifiable intangible assets  which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as a result  our amortization expense has grown as we have made acquisitions 
we perform annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
due to our website network and brand consolidation efforts  we began amortizing certain indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of  which previously had not been amortized 
this change in estimate  along with amortization from the impact of our acquisition of toprural in april  will result in increased amortization expense  offset by decreases as certain intangible assets become fully amortized 
we expect our amortization expenses to decrease in absolute dollars in as compared to  as well as decrease as a percentage of revenue in amortization expense will depend on our future acquisition activity 
other income expense interest expense is offset by interest earned on our excess cash  which is invested in short term instruments 
in  we will continue operations in the united states  the united kingdom  france  germany  brazil  switzerland  australia and spain 
as a result of operating in multiple countries  we incur gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  primarily related to the valuation of intercompany loans and short term advances 
income taxes we accrue federal  state  and foreign income taxes at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for certain items  including non deductible expenses  the most significant of which is stock based compensation  and changes in our reserves for uncertain tax positions and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in evaluating any uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate due to additional information 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which the determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as any related net interest and penalties 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the feasibility of tax planning 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which the determination is made 
historically  we have generated most of our current taxable income outside of the united states due to net operating loss carryforwards available for utilization in the united states 
in  we expect to pay corporate income taxes associated with our operations in the united kingdom  france  germany  spain and brazil  as well as certain states within the united states 
we will continue to expand our business outside of the united states  in which case  we will become subject to further taxation based on foreign statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions where we operate  and our effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result 

table of contents during the second quarter of  we began implementing a global corporate restructuring plan involving our european headquarters in geneva  switzerland to integrate our acquired businesses  streamline our european operations  and improve our internal controls 
our swiss and us subsidiaries also entered into an agreement to share the costs of website development going forward 
the impact of this restructuring plan and the start up period in switzerland results in volatility in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our us based operations and our us  france  germany  brazil  netherlands  spain  australia and switzerland based subsidiaries 
our consolidated results are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included  and  of those policies  we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations particularly in the areas of business combination and taxes 
accordingly  we believe the policies described below are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue from customers that pay fees for online advertising listing services related to the listing of their properties for rent  primarily on a subscription basis  over a fixed term 
we also generate revenue from fees based on the number of traveler inquiries and reservation bookings  local and national internet display advertisers  license of property management software and ancillary products and services 
payments for term based subscriptions received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the listing period 
revenue for inquiry based contracts are determined on a fixed fee per inquiry stated in the arrangement and recognized when the service has been performed 
internet display advertising revenue is generated primarily from advertisements appearing on our websites 
there are several types of internet advertisements  and the way in which advertising revenue is earned varies among them 
depending upon the terms  revenue might be earned each time an impression is delivered  each time a user clicks on an ad  each time a graphic ad is displayed  or each time a user clicks through on the ad and takes a specified action on the destination site 
we recognize advertising revenue on a cost per thousand cpm impression basis whereby advertisers pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites 
we sell gift cards with no expiration dates to travelers and do not charge administrative fees on unused cards 
there is a portion of the gift card obligation that  based on historical redemption patterns  will not be used or required to be remitted to relevant jurisdictions  or breakage 
at the point of sale  we recognize breakage as deferred revenue and amortize it over months based on historical redemption patterns 
we also record commission revenue for each gift card sale over the same month redemption period 

table of contents we earn a commission for online reservations revenue calculated as a percentage of the value of the reservation 
this revenue is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
through our professional software for bed and breakfasts and professional property managers  we make selected  online bookable properties available to online travel agencies and channel partners 
we receive a percentage of the transaction value or a fee from the property manager for making this inventory available  which is recognized when earned 
this revenue is included in other revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
we generate revenue from the licensing of software products  from the sale of maintenance agreements and from the sale of hosted software solutions 
for software license sales  one year of maintenance is typically included as part of the initial purchase price of the bundled offering with annual renewals of the maintenance component of the agreement following in subsequent years 
we consider delivery of software to have occurred and recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses when risk of loss transfers to the customer  which is generally upon electronic transfer of the license key that provides immediate availability of the product to the purchaser 
as software is usually sold with maintenance  the amount of revenue allocated to the software license is determined by allocating the fair value of the maintenance and subtracting it from the total invoice or contract amount 
vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of maintenance services is determined by the standard published list pricing for maintenance renewals  as we generally charge list prices for maintenance renewals 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling price for maintenance services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement beginning on the activation date 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sales of hosted software solutions are generally for a one year period 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
certain implementation services related to the hosting services are essential to the customer s use of the hosting services 
for sales of these hosting services where we are responsible for implementation  we recognize implementation revenue ratably over the estimated period of the hosting relationship  which we consider to be three years 
recognition starts once the product has been activated 
training and consulting revenue is recognized upon delivery of the training course or consulting services to the end customer 
we account for sales incentives to customers as a reduction of revenue at the time that the revenue is recognized from the related product sale 
we also report revenue net of any sales tax collected 
business combinations since our inception  we have acquired businesses 
the purchase prices of acquired businesses have been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based upon their estimated fair value at the date of purchase 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
most of the businesses we have acquired did not have a significant amount of tangible assets 
we identified the following identifiable intangible assets in each acquisition trade name  customer relationships and internal software 
each valuation of intangible assets generally used similar assumptions as most of the businesses acquired were substantially the same and were acquired simultaneously  in some cases  or within a short time period of each other 
in making other assumptions on valuation and useful lives  we considered the unique nature of each acquisition 
as of december   we had million in intangible assets net of accumulated amortization and million in goodwill 

table of contents there are three basic approaches to determining fair value of an asset the income approach  the market approach and the cost approach 
we utilized a third party valuation firm to assist us in the valuation of the acquired intangibles and the resulting allocation of purchase price for all acquisitions 
for trade name valuation  we used the relief from royalty method  which is a hybrid of the income and market approaches  for customer relationships we used the excess earnings method  a form of the income approach 
application of these approaches involves the use of estimates  judgment and assumptions  such as future cash flows and selection of comparable companies 
future changes in our assumptions or the interrelationship of those assumptions may negatively impact future valuations 
in the future  measurements of fair value and adverse changes in discounted cash flow assumptions could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets that would require a non cash charge to the combined consolidated statements of operations and may have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
our finite lived intangible assets  including trade names  internal software  customer relationships  and non compete agreements are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization 
these finite lived intangibles are amortized using a method that reflects our best estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit of the related intangible asset is utilized 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives  such as certain trade names  are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors  adverse cash flow trends  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  decline in stock price  and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
we determined that no triggering event occurred during the year ended december  under new accounting guidance adopted in for goodwill and in for indefinite lived intangible assets  we complete what is referred to as the step analysis  which involves evaluating qualitative factors  including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  and overall financial performance related to our goodwill and our indefinite lived intangible assets 
if our step analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than carrying amount  then we would perform a quantitative two step impairment test 
the quantitative analysis compares the fair value of our reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible assets to the carrying amounts  and an impairment loss is recognized equivalent to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  then the quantitative impairment tests are unnecessary 
our annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment was as of october   and we determined that the quantitative tests were not necessary 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of the reporting unit or intangible assets 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of goodwill or intangible assets 
stock based compensation we have stock based compensation plans which allow for the issuance of stock based awards  including stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards 
we account for stock based compensation expense by amortizing the fair value of each stock based award expected to vest over the requisite service or performance period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of each stock option award is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 

table of contents the black scholes model requires various assumptions including fair value of the underlying stock  volatility  expected option life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
as of each stock option grant date  we review an average of the disclosed year end volatility of our own common stock and a group of companies that we consider peers based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  similarity to us with respect to industry  business model  stage of growth  financial risk or other factors  along with considering our future plans to determine the appropriate volatility 
the expected life is based on our historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual term of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the risk free interest rate is determined by reference to the united states treasury rates with the term approximating the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of stock based awards  and we only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience 
to the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from the estimate  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
if any of the assumptions we use in estimating the fair value of awards change significantly or the actual forfeiture rate is different than the estimate  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
prior to june   the date our common stock began trading on the nasdaq  the fair value of common stock had been determined by the board of directors at each grant date based on a variety of factors  including arm s length sales of our common stock  periodic valuations of our common stock with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  our financial position  historical financial performance  projected financial performance  valuations of publicly traded peer companies and the illiquid nature of common stock 
stock based awards made following june  have a fair value based on the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq on the date of grant 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method  whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and the reversal of temporary taxable differences 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance to be recorded 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  reversals of taxable temporary differences and the feasibility of tax planning over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which the determination is made 
income tax expense or benefit is the current tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period  plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we have been a current taxpayer in the united kingdom  germany  france  brazil  spain and several states in the united states 
since our inception  in the united states  we have not had any current federal tax liabilities due to tax losses incurred in earlier years and carried forward  as well as significant stock option deductions generated in and at december   we had approximately million of us federal nols available to reduce future taxable income  million of which is attributable to pre acquisition losses of escapia  and million of which is attributable to pre acquisition losses of second porch 
our nols will begin to expire in the nols acquired from escapia and second porch are subject to an annual limitation pursuant to section of the 
table of contents internal revenue code of  as amended  due to an ownership change  which occurred at the time of our acquisition of the shares of that company 
the nols attributable to the period of time before our february  series a preferred stock financing transaction are also subject to an annual limitation due to the deemed ownership change that occurred upon the issuance of those shares 
accordingly  we have not recorded a benefit for approximately million of nols that will expire unused 
all of our nols could be subject to a further limitation if we experience an ownership change in future periods 
the difference between our effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate is primarily a function of the mix of foreign versus us income  the impact of foreign tax rates  uncertain tax positions and permanent differences  including stock based compensation charges 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher rates and by pending or future tax law changes in the countries where we conduct business  including rate changes 
in calculating our effective tax rate  significant judgment is required in determining any uncertain tax positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we are required to identify  evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of these positions that may not be sustained  or may only partially be sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates 
some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of an audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of a matter is different than the amount recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which the determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as any related net interest and penalties 
our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of any of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend either to invest our non us earnings permanently in foreign operations or to remit these earnings to our us entities in a tax free manner 
if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred  we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes

seasonality and quarterly results our operating results may fluctuate for a variety of reasons  including seasonal factors and economic cycles that influence the vacation travel market 
property owners and managers tend to buy listings at times when travelers are most likely to make vacation plans 
the timing primarily depends on whether travelers are taking a winter or summer vacation and tends to vary by country 
historically  we have experienced the highest level of new and renewed listings in the first quarter of the year  which is typically when travelers are making plans for summer vacations in the united states and europe 
the lowest level of new listings and renewals has occurred in the third quarter 
by the fourth quarter  we typically see property owners and managers of winter vacation destinations list and renew in time to meet the needs of travelers planning those trips 
other vacation areas outside of the united states and europe  such as brazil and australia  also have seasonality  but the seasonality may not be reflected in the same quarters 
this cyclicality may not be seen as prominently in our revenue due to the ratable recognition of listing revenue 
however  the seasonality results in higher cash flows during the first quarter as most listings are annual and fully paid at the time the listing is purchased 
as we introduce new products for property owners  managers 
table of contents and travelers  the seasonality of those transactions may vary from the seasonality of our listing sales 
we also experience seasonality in the number of visitors to our websites  also with the first quarter having the highest number of visitors 
this is reflected in our quarterly financial results when we add customer service staff and hosting capabilities to support the increase 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful and historical results may not be indicative of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources from our incorporation in until december   we financed our operations and acquisitions primarily through private placements of our capital stock and bank borrowings  which have been fully repaid  our initial public offering in july  which generated net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and other expenses incurred for the sale of our common stock  and from cash flows from operations 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  at december   this amount included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately million 
if these assets were distributed to the us  we may be subject to additional us taxes in certain circumstances subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
we actively monitor the third party depository institutions and money market funds that hold these assets  primarily focusing on the safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield on these assets 
we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various financial institutions and money market funds in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these financial institutions or money market funds fail or encounter difficulties 
to date  we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash  cash equivalents or short term investments  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash  cash equivalents or short term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
we have funds in our operating accounts that are deposited with third party financial institutions 
these balances in the us may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts  these cash balances could be adversely impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets

capital resources based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations  both globally and in the us  will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services  potential acquisitions and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
we may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to the extent necessary to fund such activities 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
we may enter into arrangements in the future with respect to investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products  services or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
contractual obligations and commitments the majority of our property owners and managers pay for their listings by credit card because it simplifies and expedites the payment process and is a relatively secure form of payment 
we have multiple agreements with credit card companies to support these activities 
most of our property owners and managers purchase an annual listing  for which payment is made at the beginning of the listing 
there is a risk that we may fail to fully perform our obligations under the listing  which could result in an obligation of the credit card companies to reimburse their customers for a portion or all of the listing fee 
we would be obligated to reimburse the credit card companies for all such amounts they pay pursuant to our agreements with them  under which we have obtained our credit card acceptance privileges 
as of december   we have  euros held in restricted cash to protect the bank from default on credit cards used in our operations   australian dollars in restricted cash as a draft guarantee for our payroll provider in australia and  swiss francs in restricted cash to support a bank guarantee related to our new european headquarters lease in geneva  switzerland 
as we enter into new leases and as we make changes to our credit card merchants and acquiring banks  we may have increases to restricted cash and deposits

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we have subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france  germany  switzerland  the netherlands  spain  australia and brazil 
our subsidiaries generally use the local currency as their functional currency  which we translate into us dollars for consolidation 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates involving the euro  the british pound  the brazilian reais  the swiss franc and the australian dollar 
we currently enter into forward contracts to hedge fluctuations in the value of certain intercompany debt denominated in foreign currencies but do not enter into any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
because we conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the united states but report our results in us dollars  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates  which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations 
in addition  the results of operations of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
a decline in the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase our non us revenue and improve our operating results 
conversely  if the us dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies  our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected 
the effect of an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on foreign denominated cash and receivables as of december   would result in a loss of approximately million and a reduction in value on the balance sheet of approximately million 
investments and interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in short term  high quality  interest bearing securities 
to minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
we have a non controlling equity investment in a privately held company in china 
since our ownership interest is less than percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence  we account for this non marketable equity investment using the cost method of accounting 
as of december   the carrying value of this investment was million
