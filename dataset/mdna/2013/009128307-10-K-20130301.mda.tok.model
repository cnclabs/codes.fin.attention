this report  including the information incorporated by reference  contains forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the use of any of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify such statements 
forward looking statements include statements concerning the integration of sundance  our possible or assumed future results  flight volume and collection rates for patient transports  size  structure and growth of our air medical services and products markets  continuation and or renewal of hospital contracts  acquisition of new and profitable ur division contracts  and other matters 
the actual results that we achieve may differ materially from those discussed in such forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors contained in part i  item a of this report  in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in other sections of this report  as well as in our quarterly reports on form q 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
overview we provide air medical transportation services throughout the united states and design  manufacture  and install medical aircraft interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products 
our divisions  or business segments  are organized according to the type of service or product provided and consist of the following air medical services ams provides air medical transportation services to the general population as an independent service also called community based services and to hospitals or other institutions under exclusive operating agreements also called hospital based services 
patient transport revenue consists of flight fees billed directly to patients  their insurers  or governmental agencies  and cash flow is dependent upon collection from these individuals or entities 
air medical services contract revenue consists of fixed monthly fees approximately of total contract revenue and hourly flight fees approximately of total contract revenue billed to hospitals or other institutions 
in the ams division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in united rotorcraft ur division designs  manufactures  and installs aircraft medical interiors and other aerospace and medical transport products for domestic and international customers 
in the ur division generated of our total revenue  compared to in and in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for operating results by segment 
we believe that the following factors have the greatest impact on our results of operations and financial condition flight volume 
almost all of patient transport revenue is derived from flight fees  as compared to approximately of ams contract revenue 
by contrast  of our costs primarily associated with flight operations including salaries  aircraft ownership costs  hull insurance  and general and administrative expenses incurred during the year ended december   are mainly fixed in nature 
while flight volume is affected by many factors  including competition and the effectiveness of marketing and business development initiatives  the greatest single variable has historically been weather conditions 
adverse weather conditions such as fog  high winds  or heavy precipitation hamper our ability to operate our aircraft safely and  therefore  result in reduced flight volume 
total patient transports for community based locations were approximately  for compared to approximately  for patient transports for community based locations open longer than one year same base transports were approximately  in compared to  in cancellations due to unfavorable weather conditions for community based locations open longer than one year were  lower in compared to requests for service decreased by for the year ended december   for bases open greater than one year 

table of contents reimbursement per transport 
we respond to calls for air medical transports without pre screening the creditworthiness of the patient and are subject to collection risk for services provided to insured and uninsured patients 
medicare and medicaid also receive contractual discounts from our standard charges for flight services 
patient transport revenue is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period the related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
net reimbursement per patient transport is primarily a function of price  payer mix  and timely and effective collection efforts 
both the pace of collections and the ultimate collection rate are affected by the overall health of the us economy  which impacts the number of indigent patients and funding for state run programs  such as medicaid 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many jurisdictions have remained well below the cost of providing air medical transportation 
in addition  the collection rate is impacted by changes in the cost of healthcare and health insurance  as the cost of healthcare increases  health insurance coverage provided by employers may be reduced  resulting in an increase in the uninsured population 
most of the significant provisions of the ppaca are not scheduled to take effect until  and the impact on our reimbursement rates is  therefore  unknown 
net reimbursement per transport increased in the year ended december   compared to  attributed to recent price increases 
provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care as a percentage of related gross billings for patient transports were as follows for years ended december  gross billings provision for contractual discounts provision for uncompensated care although price increases generally increase the net reimbursement per transport from insurance payers  the amount per transport collectible from private patient payers  medicare  and medicaid does not increase proportionately with price increases 
therefore  depending upon overall payer mix  price increases will usually result in an increase in the percentage of uncollectible accounts 
although we have not yet experienced significant increased limitations in the amount reimbursed by insurance companies  continued price increases may cause insurance companies to limit coverage for air medical transport to amounts less than our standard rates 
the increase in the percentage of uncollectible accounts in and also reflects the addition of omniflight which had a higher gross charge structure and  therefore  a higher percentage of uncollectible accounts 
in addition  the percentage of transports covered by insurance for omniflight s operations has historically been approximately three to four percentage points lower than the percentage of insured transports for the company s historical operations 
the number of transports covered by insurance decreased from of total transports for the year ended december   to of total transports for the year ended december   with the decrease moving almost equally to medicare and private patient payers 
aircraft maintenance 
ams operations are directly affected by fluctuations in aircraft maintenance costs 
proper operation of the aircraft by flight crews and standardized maintenance practices can help to contain maintenance costs 
increases in spare parts prices from original equipment manufacturers tend to be higher for aircraft which are no longer in production 
two models of aircraft within our fleet  representing of the rotor wing fleet  are no longer in production and are  therefore  susceptible to price increases which outpace general inflationary trends 
in addition  on condition components are more likely to require replacement with age 
since january   we have taken delivery of new aircraft and have commitments to take delivery of additional aircraft over the next three years 
we have replaced discontinued models and other older aircraft with the new aircraft  as well as provided capacity for base expansion 
replacement models of aircraft typically have higher ownership costs than the models targeted for replacement but lower maintenance costs 
total maintenance expense increased from the year ended december   to the year ended december   while total flight volume increased over the same period 
the change in maintenance expense reflects normal fluctuations in the timing of overhaul and replacement cycles for aircraft parts  as well as the acquisition of omniflight in august 
table of contents competitive pressures from low cost providers 
we are recognized within the industry for our standard of service and our use of cabin class aircraft 
many of our competitors utilize aircraft with lower ownership and operating costs and do not require a similar level of experience for aviation and medical personnel 
reimbursement rates established by medicare  medicaid  and most insurance providers are not contingent upon the type of aircraft used or the experience of personnel 
however  we believe that higher quality standards help to differentiate our service from competitors and  therefore  lead to higher utilization 
employee recruitment and relations 
the ability to deliver quality services is partially dependent upon our ability to hire and retain employees who have advanced aviation  nursing  and other technical skills 
in addition  hospital contracts typically contain minimum certification requirements for pilots and mechanics 
employees who meet these standards are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource in the foreseeable future 
our pilots are represented by a collective bargaining unit and are covered under a cba which is effective through december  other employee groups may also elect to be represented by unions in the future

increases in salaries for merit pay raises 
aircraft operating expenses increased  or  for the year ended december   in comparison to aircraft operating expenses consist of fuel  insurance  and maintenance costs and generally are a function of the size of the fleet  the type of aircraft flown  and the number of hours flown 
the increase in costs is due to the following increase in aircraft maintenance expense of  or  to  total flight volume increased for compared to the change in maintenance expense reflects normal fluctuations in the timing of overhaul and replacement cycles for aircraft parts 
increase of approximately in the cost of aircraft fuel per hour flown

the increase in expense also reflects additional headcount in our safety department to support the ongoing implementation of our safety management system sms and in our billing  dispatch  and transfer center departments to support the increase in third party contracts 
interest expense increased  or  for the year ended december   compared to the increase is primarily due to interest of  recorded on capital lease obligations assumed in the omniflight acquisition and to interest incurred on the million term loan originated to fund the acquisition of omniflight 
the term loan bears interest at a variable rate which averaged from inception through december  in addition  we carried an average balance of million against our line of credit during the fourth quarter of  compared to no borrowings against our line in these increases were partially offset by the effect of the reduction in principal balances for long term debt and capital lease obligations as a result of regularly scheduled payments

if financing arrangements cannot be arranged or we are prevented from taking or decline to take delivery of the aircraft under the commitments described above for any other reason  we may forfeit nonrefundable deposits of approximately million 
the amount of deposit to be forfeited may be mitigated if the aircraft manufacturer is able to remarket the commitment positions 
as of december   we have received financing commitments  subject to routine credit approval and aircraft inspection processes  to cover the cost of all aircraft scheduled to be delivered in we intend to use the new aircraft for base expansion opportunities as well as to replace older models of aircraft in the fleet 
we plan to either sell the aircraft which are replaced  use them for spare parts  or redeploy them into the backup fleet

table of contents financing activities used  in compared to providing  in the primary uses of cash in both and were regularly scheduled payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations and capital lease buy outs 
in the payment of a special cash dividend of million was funded by an additional million term loan under our senior credit facility 
although our current intention is to retain any future earnings to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay dividends  we may consider the payment of dividends in the future 
our senior credit facility contains a covenant which restricts  but does not prohibit  the payment of dividends 
lease buy outs of million in were funded primarily through borrowings under our line of credit and cash from current operations 
we also used additional draws against our line of credit to fund the purchase of sundance on december  in we used cash reserves to retire our previous term loan and proceeds from the million term loan under our restated revolving credit  term loan and security agreement to fund the acquisition of omniflight 
we began making scheduled quarterly principal payments on the term loan beginning with the quarter ended september  we also drew against our line of credit in to fund the buy out of leased aircraft 
senior credit facility our senior credit facility consists of term loans with a balance of  as of december   and a revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had  outstanding against the million revolving credit facility and available capacity on the facility of  the capacity available on the revolving credit facility is reduced by four outstanding letters of credit totaling borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of our accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  and general intangibles 
indebtedness under the credit facility has a first priority claim to the assets pledged to secure it 
quarterly principal payments are due beginning in as follows of total principal balance per quarter for quarters  of total principal balance per quarter for quarters  and of total principal balance per quarter for quarters all remaining principal is due at the maturity date in december but can be prepaid at any time without penalty 
base rate loans as defined in the amended and restated revolving credit  term loan and security agreement bear interest at the greater of i prime or ii the federal funds rate plus to

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit facility and other notes 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 

table of contents on an on going basis  management evaluates our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition fixed contract revenue under our operating agreements with hospitals is recognized monthly over the terms of the agreements 
revenue relating to patient transports is recognized upon completion of the services and is recorded net of provisions for contractual discounts and estimated uncompensated care 
both provisions are estimated during the period related services are performed based on historical collection experience and any known trends or changes in reimbursement rate schedules and payer mix 
the provisions are adjusted as required based on actual collections in subsequent periods 
we have from time to time experienced delays in reimbursement from third party payers 
in addition  third party payers may disallow  in whole or in part  claims for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage  determinations of medical necessity  or the need for additional information 
laws and regulations governing medicare and medicaid programs are very complex and subject to interpretation 
we also provide services to patients who have no insurance or other third party payer coverage 
there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same collection rates that we have in the past 
if actual future collections are more or less than those projected by management  adjustments to allowances for contractual discounts and uncompensated care may be required 
based on related patient transport revenue for the year ended december   a change of basis points in the percentage of estimated contractual discounts and uncompensated care would have resulted in a change of approximately  in patient transport revenue 
revenue related to fixed fee medical interior and products contracts is recorded as costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of an estimate of the total costs to complete the project 
losses on contracts in process are recognized when determined 
if total costs to complete a project are greater or less than estimated  the gross margin on the project may be greater or less than originally recorded under the percentage of completion method 
deferred income taxes in preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciable assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income in the respective federal or state jurisdiction as appropriate and record a valuation allowance for those amounts we believe are not likely to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and the expected timing of reversals of existing temporary differences in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance in a period increases income tax expense 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in statutory tax rates applicable to the company is also recognized in income in the period of the change 
we evaluate the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position and applicable tax law and other tax pronouncements 
changes in our estimates of uncertain tax positions would be recognized as an adjustment to income tax expense in the period of the change 

table of contents long lived assets valuation in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
estimates of useful lives and residual values of aircraft are based upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted for estimated current industry trends  the economy  and operating conditions 
goodwill valuation the company s goodwill relates to seven acquisitions and has been allocated to our reporting units 
during the first quarter of  we adopted asu no 
 testing for goodwill impairment  which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
factors considered include overall economic conditions within our markets  access to capital  changes in the cost of operations  the financial performance of the company  and the change in our stock price during the year 
based upon our qualitative assessment of factors impacting the value of goodwill as of december   we determined that it is not likely that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and that a quantitative assessment of goodwill was not necessary 
changes in these factors or a continued decline in general economic conditions could change our conclusion regarding an impairment of goodwill and potentially result in a non cash impairment loss in a future period 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after this assessment  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  the entity is not required to take further action 
if an entity concludes otherwise  it is required to determine whether impairment exists by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the asset 
the asu is effective for periods beginning after september  implementation of asu no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates
