item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  including forward looking statements  could adversely affect our ability to execute this strategy 
a failure to execute these strategic objectives could adversely affect the company financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
moreover  there can be no assurances that  even if implemented  that the strategy will be successful 
the company may incur significant restructuring charges 
the company has taken  and expects to take  restructuring actions to realign and resize its production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements 
charges related to these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
moreover  there can be no assurances that any future restructurings will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results 
impairment charges relating to the company s goodwill and long lived assets and possible increases to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances could adversely affect the company s financial performance 
the company regularly monitors its goodwill and long lived assets for impairment indicators 
in conducting its goodwill impairment testing  the company compares the fair value of each of its reporting units to the related net book value 
in conducting the impairment analysis of long lived assets  the company compares the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long lived assets to the related net book values 
changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of goodwill or long lived assets 
in the event that the company determines that its goodwill or long lived assets are impaired  the company may be required to record a significant charge to earnings that could materially affect the company s results of operations and financial condition in the period s recognized 
the company recorded asset impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively  to adjust the carrying value of certain assets to their estimated fair value 
in addition  the company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to recover remaining net deferred tax assets  which are dependent upon achieving future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions 
failure to achieve its taxable income targets may change the company s assessment of the recoverability of its remaining net deferred tax assets and would likely result in an increase in the valuation allowance in the applicable period 
any increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense  which could have a significant impact on the company s future results of operations 

table of contents the company s expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and could materially change as a result of changes in mix of earnings and other factors 
changes in the company s debt and capital structure  among other items  may impact its effective tax rate 
the company s overall effective tax rate is computed as consolidated tax expense as a percentage of consolidated earnings before tax 
however  tax expenses and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional basis 
further  the company is in a position whereby losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions generally provide no current financial statement benefit 
in addition  certain jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the united states statutory rate 
as such  changes in the mix and source of earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on the company s overall effective tax rate in future periods 
changes in tax law and rates  changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes or adverse outcomes from tax audits that regularly are in process in any of the jurisdictions in which the company operates could also have a significant impact on the company s overall effective rate in future periods 
the company s ability to effectively operate could be hindered if it fails to attract and retain key personnel 
the company s ability to operate its business and implement its strategies effectively depends  in part  on the efforts of its executive officers and other key employees 
in addition  the company s future success will depend on  among other factors  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  particularly engineers and other employees with critical expertise and skills that support key customers and products or in emerging regions 
the loss of the services of any key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
warranty claims  product liability claims and product recalls could harm the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company faces the inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that its products fail to perform as expected or such failure results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury or property damage or both 
in addition  if any of the company s designed products are defective or are alleged to be defective  the company may be required to participate in a recall campaign 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions  automakers are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are increasingly looking to suppliers for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against the company in excess of its available insurance coverage and established reserves  or a requirement that the company participate in a product recall campaign  could have materially adverse effects on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes  which could have an adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial position 
the company is involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that  from time to time  are significant 
these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes including disputes with suppliers  intellectual property matters  personal injury claims and employment matters 
no assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on the company s profitability and financial position 
the company could be adversely impacted by environmental laws and regulations 
the company s operations are subject to us and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing emissions to air  discharges to water  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials  and the cleanup of contaminated properties 
currently  environmental costs with respect to former  existing or subsequently acquired operations are not material  but there is no assurance that the company will not be adversely impacted by such costs  liabilities or claims in the future either under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future 
developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact its business 
the company owns significant intellectual property  including a number of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets  and is involved in numerous licensing arrangements 
the company s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position in a number of the markets served 
developments or assertions by or against the company relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact the company s business 
significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect the company s business and results of operations and financial condition

the company s business and results of operations could be affected adversely by terrorism 
terrorist sponsored attacks  both foreign and domestic  could have adverse effects on the company s business and results of operations 
these attacks could accelerate or exacerbate other automotive industry risks such as those described above and also have the potential to interfere with the company s business by disrupting supply chains and the delivery of products to customers 
a failure of the company s internal controls could adversely affect the company s ability to report its financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis 
as a result  the company s business  operating results and liquidity could be harmed 
because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud  even an effective system of internal control may not prevent or detect all misstatements 
in the event of an internal control failure  the company s ability to report its financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely impacted  which could result in a loss of investor confidence in its financial reports or have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to operate its business or access sources of liquidity
