overview we are a biotechnology company focused on commercializing our proprietary platform technologies the ibiolaunch platform for vaccines and therapeutic proteins  and the ibiomodulator platform for vaccine enhancement 
we plan on developing and commercializing select product candidates derived from the ibiolaunch platform  which is a proprietary  transformative technology for development and production of biologics using transient gene expression in hydroponically grown  unmodified green plants 
the ibiomodulator platform is complementary to the ibiolaunch platform and is designed to significantly improve vaccine products with both higher potency and greater duration of effect 
the ibiomodulator platform can be used with any recombinant expression technology for vaccine development and production 
we believe our technology offers advantages that are not available with conventional manufacturing systems 
these anticipated advantages may include the ability to manufacture therapeutic proteins that are difficult or impossible to produce with conventional methods  reduced production time  and lower capital and operating costs 
ibio was established in august as the result of a spin off from integrated biopharma  inc we operate in one business segment under the direction of our executive chairman  and our operations and assets reside exclusively in the united states 
our near term focus is to realize two key objectives the establishment of additional business arrangements pursuant to which commercial  government and not for profit licensees will utilize our platform technology in connection with the production and development of products for both therapeutic and vaccine uses  and the further advancement of product candidates selected for clinical development 
these objectives are a part of our strategy to commercialize the proprietary technology we have developed and validated 
our strategy to engage in partnering and out licensing of our technology preserves the opportunity for ibio to share in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates while conserving our own capital and financial resources as licensees undertake to conduct and fund the development and commercialization of the product candidates derived under our platform 
in addition to financial resources we may receive  we believe that successful development by licensees of product candidates derived from the ibio platforms will further validate our technology  increase awareness of the advantages that may be realized by its use and promote broader adoption of our transformative technology 
the advancement of product candidates which have been derived from the ibiolaunch platform is also a key element of our strategy 
we believe that selecting and developing products which individually have substantial commercial value and are representative of classes of pharmaceuticals that can be successfully produced using the ibiolaunch technology will allow us to maximize the near and longer term value of our technology 
to realize this result  we believe that we should seek to advance designated product candidates through the preclinical stage required for submission of investigational new drug applications and  in some instances  early stage clinical development 
results of operations revenue revenue for the years ended june  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the revenue was the result of research and development services provided to fiocruz by fraunhofer  as ibio s contractor  to assist in implementing the company s technology for a planned phase i clinical trial of a yellow fever vaccine  pursuant to an agreement entered into in january there was no license revenue for the years ended june  and research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended june  were approximately million versus approximately million for the year ended june   a decline of approximately million  or 
approximately million of the decline was attributable to the completion by fraunhofer of two research projects in the prior year while there were no projects of similar size and cost undertaken in the current year 
in addition  the prior year results included two months of expense totaling approximately million related to the april semi annual million tta payment 
for the current year  there was no expense recorded against the april payment due  as no work was performed by fraunhofer to earn such payment 
as of june   the million liability for the contractually obligated april payment was recognized on the company s balance sheet in accrued expenses with an offsetting debit to prepaid expenses 
the company and fraunhofer have been involved in an on going dialogue to restructure the nature of the relationship and the contractual obligations between the parties 
that process reached its conclusion in september with the ratification of the settlement agreement by the boards of directors of the parties discussed in detail in contractual obligations below 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were approximately million versus approximately million for the year ended june   a decline of approximately million  or 
the million decline was almost entirely related to lower share based compensation expense in the current year  as older options with a higher grant date fair value vested in the prior year while more recently issued options vesting in the current year had a lower grant date fair value 
in addition  the prior year general and administrative expenses included an option modification charge of approximately million 
while consulting and investor relations expenses declined by approximately million in the current year versus the prior year  this was offset by higher personnel related costs in the current year as full time employees were added to perform these and other activities on behalf of the company 
other income expense total other income for the year ended june  was approximately million versus approximately million of income for the year ended june   a decline of approximately million  or 
this was almost entirely due to the year over year change in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability  which must be marked to market each reporting period with changes charged to other income or expense as appropriate 
this liability has continued to decline as the fair value of the warrant derivative liability has fallen dramatically over the past two years  finally reaching no value as of june  the august options containing the anti dilution provision that is the source of this derivative liability expired in august in addition  interest expense increased slightly in the current year versus the prior year as the balance due to fraunhofer under the tta continued to rise 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities for the years ended june  and  we incurred net losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
after adjustments for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities  the net cash used in operating activities for the years ended june  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the decline of approximately million of cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower cash expenditures on research and development activities in the current year versus the prior year resulting from the completion of two projects 
net cash used in investing activities for each of the years ended june  and  net cash used in investing activities was approximately million 
cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to additions to intangible assets 
net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended june  and  net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company completed equity offerings in april and january and these amounts represent the proceeds of those offerings net of the related expenses 
funding requirements we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since our spinoff from integrated biopharma  inc in august as of june   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  and we used approximately million and million of cash for operating activities for the years ended june  and  respectively 
as of june   cash on hand of approximately million  considering the effects of the settlement agreement completed in september  is expected to support the company s activities through the third quarter of the fiscal year ending june  we have historically financed our activities through the sale of common stock and warrants 
on april   we  under our effective registration statement on form s  raised approximately million in net proceeds by issuing  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
the common stock and warrants were sold together as units  with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and of one warrant to purchase one share of common stock 
the public offering price of each unit was 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share  are immediately exercisable and will expire on the third anniversary of the date of issuance 
we plan to fund our future business operations using cash on hand  through proceeds from the sale of additional equity or other securities and through proceeds realized in connection with license and collaboration arrangements 
the history of significant losses  the negative cash flow from operations  the limited cash resources currently on hand and our dependence on our ability about which there can be no certainty to obtain additional financing to fund our operations after the current cash resources are exhausted raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
pursuant to rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission that are applicable to ibio and other reporting companies that have a public float the market value of securities held by non affiliates of less than million  under our effective registration statement on form s  we may not during any month period offer securities that have a market value greater than of the public float 
the closing prices of our common stock during the day period prior to each offering  the number of shares of common stock then held by non affiliates and prior offers and sales of shares of common stock registered under the registration statement on form s during a month period prior to the date of offering are factors in calculating the aggregate offering proceeds that may be realized 
the april  equity offering has effectively eliminated the capacity currently available under our effective registration statement on form s as a result  unless either  or both  our stock price and or the number of shares of our common stock held by non affiliates increases substantially  it is anticipated that we will be unable to complete additional offerings of securities under our effective registration statement on form s prior to april to the extent we seek to sell additional equity securities prior to april  we may be required to effect such offers and sales pursuant to private placements or registration under a registration statement on form s we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on favorable terms  or available at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
if we are unable to raise funds when required or on favorable terms  we may have to a significantly delay  scale back  or discontinue the product application and or commercialization of our proprietary technologies  b seek collaborators for our technology and product candidates on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available  c relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies  product candidates  or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize  or d possibly cease operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually limited purposes 
as of june   we were not involved in any spe transactions 
contractual obligations our most significant contractual obligation is the tta with fraunhofer 
in september  we and fraunhofer completed the settlement agreement  which is intended to better align the mutual interests of ibio and fraunhofer and which has the following effects our liabilities to fraunhofer in the amount of approximately million as of june  were released and terminated  the term of the tta has been extended by one year and will now expire on december   our obligation under the tta  prior to the settlement agreement  to make three million payments to fraunhofer in april  november  and april guaranteed annual payments was terminated and replaced with an obligation to engage fraunhofer to perform at least million of research and development work as directed by ibio prior to december  we believe that our right to select and direct specific projects will improve the efficiency of our product development activities and that the extension of the period over which this commitment must be fulfilled will enhance our ability to manage our cash outflow  we terminated and released fraunhofer from the obligation to make further financial contributions toward the enhancement  improvement and expansion of our technology in an amount at least equal to the guaranteed annual payments  because we believe our technology development phase is completed and now are focusing on product development 
in addition  we terminated and released fraunhofer from the obligation to further reimburse us for certain past and future patent related expenses  our obligation to remit to fraunhofer minimum annual royalty payments in the amount of  was terminated 
instead we will be obligated to remit royalties to fraunhofer only on technology license revenues that we actually receive and on revenues from actual sales by us of products derived from our technology until the later of november or until such time as the aggregate royalty payments total at least million  the rate at which we will be obligated to pay royalties to fraunhofer on ibiolaunch and ibiomodulator license revenues we receive was reduced from to  and any and all other claims of each party to any other amounts due at june  were mutually released 
the pro forma effects of the settlement agreement as if it were reflected on our condensed balance sheet as of june  are as follows in thousands actual june  audited pro forma june  unaudited assets current assets cash   accounts receivable trade   prepaid expenses and other current assets  total current assets   fixed assets  net intangible assets  net   total assets   liabilities and stockholders equity current liabilities accounts payable   accrued expenses  warrant derivative liability total liabilities   commitments and contingencies stockholders equity preferred stock common stock additional paid in capital   accumulated deficit   total stockholders equity   total liabilities and stockholders equity   the pro forma effects of the settlement agreement as if it were reflected on our condensed statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june  are as follows in thousands for the fiscal years ended june  actual audited pro forma unaudited revenues   operating expenses research and development   general and administrative   total operating expenses   operating loss   other income expense interest income interest expense royalty income change in fair value of warrant derivative liability other net loss   additionally  we and fraunhofer have entered into research and development service agreements with respect to two projects  specifically the further development of the recombinant form of c esterase inhibitor we are currently internally advancing through preclinical ind enabling studies and additional development services in connection with the transfer of our technology to fiocruz  which represent approximately million of the million commitment described above 
based on the timelines established between the parties upon signing of the agreements  this work is expected to be completed by late critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us us gaap 
all applicable us gaap accounting standards effective as of june  have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the preparation financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our financial statements 
we base our estimates  to the extent possible  on historical experience 
historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
intangible assets the company accounts for intangible assets at their historical cost and records amortization utilizing the straight line method based upon their estimated useful lives 
patents are amortized over a period of ten years and other intellectual property is amortized over a period from to years 
the company reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
evaluating for impairment requires judgment  and recoverability is assessed by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows of the assets over the remaining useful life to the carrying amount 
impairments  if any  are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
there were no impairment charges for the year ended june  for the year ended june   the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million which is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations 
derivative instruments the company does not use derivative instruments in its ordinary course of business 
some of the company s outstanding warrants contain an anti dilution provision which qualifies as an embedded derivative and must be accounted for separately as a derivative liability 
this liability is recognized on the balance sheet at fair value each reporting period  and changes in the fair value are charged to other income or expense  as appropriate  and reflected in the current period earnings 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
research and development costs all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
these expenses consist primarily of payments to third party contractual service providers and internal personnel costs 
share based compensation the company recognizes the cost of all share based payment transactions at fair value 
compensation cost  measured by the fair value of the equity instruments issued  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  is recognized in the financial statements as the respective awards are earned over the performance period 
the company uses historical data to estimate forfeiture rates 
the impact that share based payment awards will have on the company s results of operations is a function of the number of shares awarded  the trading price of the company s stock at the date of grant or modification  and the vesting schedule 
furthermore  the application of the black scholes option pricing model employs weighted average assumptions for expected volatility of the company s stock  expected term until exercise of the options  the risk free interest rate  and dividends  if any  to determine fair value 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company s common stock  the expected term until exercise represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and the company s historical exercise patterns  and the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 
the company has not paid any dividends since its inception and does not anticipate paying any dividends for the foreseeable future  so the dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rates or laws on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date of the rate change 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized from operations 
tax benefits of uncertain tax positions are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the company will be able to sustain a position taken on an income tax return 
the company has no liability for uncertain tax positions 
interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized as income tax expense 
the company does not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits  nor was any significant interest expense recognized during the years ended june  and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information under this item is not required to be provided by smaller reporting companies
