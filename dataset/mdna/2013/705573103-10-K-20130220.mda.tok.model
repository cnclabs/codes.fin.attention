the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from software licenses  maintenance fees related to our software licenses  and consulting services 
our license arrangements  whether involving a perpetual license or a term license  generally contain multiple elements  including consulting services  training  and software maintenance services 
software revenue recognition requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those elements and recognized as those elements are delivered 
any remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the software license  the first delivered element 
revenue is recognized for each element when all of the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
changes in the mix of the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
before we can recognize revenue  the following four basic criteria must be met persuasive evidence of an arrangement as evidence of the existence of an arrangement  we use a contract or purchase order signed by the customer for software and maintenance and a statement of work for consulting services 
in the event the customer is a reseller we ensure a binding agreement exists between the reseller and end user of the software 
delivery of product software is delivered electronically or shipped via disk media 
services  including maintenance  are considered delivered as the work is performed or  in the case of maintenance  over the contractual service period 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement 
in addition  we assess whether contract modifications to an existing term arrangement constitute a concession 
our agreements do not include a right of return 
collection of fee is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history  its current creditworthiness  economic conditions in the customer s industry and geographic location  and general economic conditions 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
software license revenues perpetual software license fees are recognized as revenue when the software is delivered  any acceptance required by contract that is not perfunctory is obtained  no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software  other than maintenance  and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
term software license fees are payable on a monthly  quarterly  or annual basis under license agreements that typically have a three to five year term and may be renewed for additional terms at the customer s option 
as a result of our focus on frequent sales to our targeted customers  our strategy to sell initial term licensing agreements to those customers with the goal to generate follow on sales  and as a result of extended payment terms and other factors  such as the risk of concessions  we recognize term license revenue over the term of the agreement as payments become due or earlier if prepaid  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

table of contents until  the majority of our term license arrangements were larger agreements with extended payment terms that did not typically result in follow on license agreements 
we no longer utilize this business model for software license transactions and as of december  and  the remaining balance of these installment receivables totaled zero and million  respectively 
subscription revenue primarily consists of license  maintenance and bundled services revenue recognized on our license arrangements that include a right to unspecified future products  which is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
maintenance revenues first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support period  which is generally one year and subject to annual renewals 
perpetual license maintenance obligations are based on separately stated renewal rates in the arrangement that are substantive and therefore represent vsoe of fair value 
term license arrangements include separately stated maintenance fees and we use separate sales to determine vsoe of fair value 
professional services revenues our professional services revenue is comprised of fees for consulting services  including software implementation  training  reimbursable expenses and sales of our pega cloud offering pega cloud 
consulting services may be provided on a stand alone basis or bundled with a license and software maintenance services 
revenue from training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts is recognized as services are performed 
we have vsoe of fair value for our training services and consulting services under time and materials contracts in north america  australia  and europe 
consulting services may occasionally be provided on a fixed price basis 
we do not have vsoe of fair value for fixed price services or time and materials services in certain geographical regions 
when these services are part of a multiple element arrangement  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software  and when services  including maintenance  are the only undelivered element  we recognize the revenue from the total arrangement ratably over the longer of the software maintenance period or the service period 
revenue from fixed price services that are not bundled with a software license is generally recognized ratably during the service period  which is typically less than four months 
revenue from stand alone sales of pega cloud is recognized ratably over the term of the service 
when implementation services are sold together with our pega cloud offering and these services have stand alone value to the customer  we account for these services separately from our pega cloud offering as described earlier 
stand alone value is established through the customer s ability to buy these services from many trained partner system integrators and from transactions sold independently from the sale of pega cloud 
since these multiple element arrangements are not software license sales  we apply a selling price hierarchy 
under the selling price hierarchy  third party evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist  and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
generally  we are not able to determine tpe as our sales strategy is customized to the needs of our customers and our products or services are dissimilar to comparable products or services in the marketplace 
in determining esp  we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors  based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
we typically arrive at an esp for a service that is not sold separately by considering company specific factors such as geographies  competitive landscape  and pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and discounting 

table of contents warranties and indemnification we warrant to our customers that our software products will conform to documented specifications for a limited period 
we have not experienced significant claims related to software warranties beyond the scope of maintenance support  which we are already obligated to provide  and consequently we have not established reserves for warranty obligations 
our agreements with customers generally require us to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third party patent  copyright  trademark or other proprietary rights 
such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
as of december   we had not experienced any losses related to these indemnification obligations and no claims were outstanding 
deferred revenue deferred software license revenue typically results from customer billings for which all of the criteria to recognize revenue have not been met 
deferred maintenance revenue represents software license updates and product support contracts that are typically billed in advance and are recognized ratably over the support periods 
deferred professional services revenue represents advanced billings for consulting and training services that are recognized as the services are performed 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment goodwill represents the residual purchase price paid in a business combination after all identified assets and liabilities have been recorded 
goodwill is not amortized  but prior to the company s adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic asu in the fourth quarter of  was tested annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
we performed our qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of and and concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
in  we compared the carrying value of our reporting unit to its fair value 
had the fair value of the reporting unit been less than its carrying amount  we would have determined the implied fair value of the goodwill and evaluated it for impairment 
we evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in evaluating potential impairment of these assets  we specifically consider whether any indicators of impairment are present  including  but not limited to whether there has been a significant adverse change in the business climate that affects the value of an asset  whether there has been a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  and whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its originally estimated useful life 
if indicators of impairment are present  we compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows that the specific asset is expected to generate to its carrying value 
these estimates involve significant subjectivity 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the available carryback or carryforward periods 
sources of taxable income include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
changes in our valuation allowance impact income tax expense in the period of adjustment 
our deferred tax valuation allowances require significant judgment and uncertainties  including assumptions about future taxable income that are based on historical and projected information 
we determined that we may utilize approximately million of acquired chordiant federal and foreign net operating losses nols  of which approximately million remained available as of december  the acquired federal nols are subject to annual limitations through as a result of the purchase price allocation  we recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million related to these acquired nols 
if our taxable income is not consistent with our expectations or the timing of income is not within the applicable carryforward period  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance on all or a portion of these deferred tax assets 
we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements 
we classify liabilities for uncertain tax positions as non current liabilities unless the uncertainty is expected to be resolved within one year 
we classify interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense 
as a global company  we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and nexus and tax credit estimates 
in addition  the calculation of acquired tax attributes and the associated limitations are complex 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and estimate the probability of such outcomes 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns  and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
see note income taxes in the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may affect us due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
foreign currency exposure we derived approximately   and  of our total revenue from sales to customers based outside of the us in  and  respectively 
our international sales are usually denominated in foreign currencies 
however  the operating expenses of our foreign operations are also primarily denominated in foreign currencies  which partially offset our foreign currency exposure 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies  particularly the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar  could adversely impact our revenues and operating results 

table of contents beginning in the second quarter of  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting foreign currency denominated accounts receivable  intercompany payables  and cash held by our us operating company 
our us operating company invoices most of our foreign customers in foreign currencies  so it holds cash and receivables denominated in these foreign currencies 
our us operating company s functional currency is the us dollar 
therefore  when there are changes in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar  we recognize a foreign currency transaction gain or loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we have intercompany accounts that are eliminated in consolidation  but that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  which are recorded as foreign currency transaction gains or losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we are primarily exposed to changes in the value of the euro and british pound relative to the us dollar 
we have not designated the foreign currency forward contracts as hedging instruments and as a result  we record their fair value at the end of each reporting period in our consolidated balance sheet as other current assets for unrealized gains and accrued expenses for unrealized losses  with any fluctuations in the value of these contracts recognized in other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
generally  we enter into contracts with terms of days or less 
the fluctuations in the value of these foreign currency forward contracts partially offset the gains and losses from the remeasurement or settlement of the foreign currency denominated accounts receivable  intercompany payables  and cash held by the us operating company  thus mitigating the volatility 
during  the company entered into and settled foreign currency forward contracts to sell million and million and receive in exchange million 
during  the company entered into and settled foreign currency forward contracts to sell million and million and receive in exchange million 
as of december  and december   the company did not have any foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
during  the change in the fair value of the company s foreign currency forward contracts recorded in other expense income  net  was a loss of million 
during  the change in the fair value of the company s foreign currency forward contracts recorded in other expense income  net  was a gain million 
the impact on net income of the gains and losses recorded on the foreign currency forward contracts  which is included in other expense income  net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  and the foreign currency transaction gains and losses recorded on the remeasurement and settlement of the foreign currency denominated assets  which is included in foreign currency transaction gain loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  was a net loss of approximately million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
these net losses were primarily due to timing of settlement of intercompany balances and foreign currency denominated cash held as of the end of the period  for which we did not have foreign currency forward contracts 
interest rate exposure as of december   we had million of marketable debt securities  which consisted of corporate and municipal bonds  with a weighted average remaining maturity of months 
due to the overall short term remaining maturities of our marketable debt securities  our interest rate exposure is not significant 
as of december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would have reduced the fair value of our fixed rate marketable debt securities by approximately million
