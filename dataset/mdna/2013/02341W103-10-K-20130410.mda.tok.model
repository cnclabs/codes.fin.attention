item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global company focused on long term profitability growth through the development and application of minerals and technology products and services to various industrial and consumer markets 
the majority of our revenue growth has been achieved by sustaining our products technological advantages  developing new products and applying them in innovative ways  bringing additional products and services to markets we already serve  and overall growth in the industries we serve 
we focus our research and development activities in areas where we can either leverage our current customer relationships and mineral reserves or enhance existing or related products and services 
the principal mineral that we utilize to generate revenues is bentonite 
we own or lease bentonite reserves in the us  australia  china and turkey 
additionally  through our affiliates and joint ventures  we have access to bentonite reserves in egypt  india  and mexico 
we also develop applications for other minerals  including chromite ore from our mine in south africa 
bentonite is surface mined when it is commercially feasible to have it shipped to a plant for further processing  including crushing  drying  milling and packaging 
bentonite deposits have varying physical properties which require us to identify which markets our reserves can serve 
nicknamed the mineral of a thousand uses  bentonite s unique characteristics include its ability to bind  swell  adsorb  control rheology  soften fabrics  and have its surface modified through chemical and physical reactions 
our research and development activities  including our understanding of bentonite properties  mining methods  processing and application to markets are some of the core components of our longevity and future prospects 
we operate in five segments performance materials  construction technologies  energy services  transportation and corporate 
both our performance materials and construction technologies segments operate manufacturing facilities in north america  europe  and the asia pacific region 
our performance materials segment also owns and operates a chrome mine in south africa 
our energy services segment principally operates in the gulf of mexico and surrounding states and also has a growing presence in south america  africa and asia 
additionally  we have a transportation segment that provides trucking services for our domestic performance materials and construction technologies segments as well as third parties 
our customers are engaged in various end markets and geographic regions 
customers in the performance materials segment range from foundries that produce castings for automotive  industrial  and transportation equipment  including heavy duty trucks and railroad cars  to producers of consumer goods  including cat litter  cosmetics and laundry care 
customers in our construction technologies segment include construction contractors  engineering contractors and government agencies 
the energy services segment s customer base is primarily comprised of oil and natural gas service or exploration companies 
a significant portion of our products have been used in the same applications for decades and have experienced minimal technological obsolescence 
a majority of our sales are made pursuant to short term agreements  therefore  terms of sale  such as pricing and volume  can change within our fiscal year 
a majority of our revenues are generated in the americas  principally north america 
consequently  the state of the us economy  and especially the metalcasting and commercial construction industries  impacts our revenues 
our fastest growing markets are in the asia pacific and certain european regions  which have continued to outpace the us in economic growth 
sustainable  long term profit growth is our primary objective 
we employ a number of strategic initiatives to achieve this goal organic growth the central component of our growth strategy is expansion of our product lines and market presence 
we have a history of commitment to research and development activities directed at bringing innovative products to market 
we believe this approach to growth offers the best probability of achieving our long term goals at the lowest risk 
globalization as we have done for decades  we continue to expand our manufacturing and marketing organizations into emerging geographic markets 
we see significant opportunities in the asia pacific and european regions for expanding our revenues and earnings over the long term as a number of markets we serve  such as metalcasting and lining technologies  are expected to grow in these areas 
we expect to take advantage of these growth areas  either through our wholly owned subsidiaries or investments in affiliates and joint ventures 
mineral development bentonite is a component in many of the products we supply 
since it is a natural material  we must continually expand our reserve base to maintain a long term business 
our goal is to add new reserves to replace the bentonite mined each year 
furthermore  we need to assure that new reserves meet the physical property requirements for our diverse product lines and are economical to mine 
our organization is committed to developing its global reserve base to meet these requirements 
acquisitions we continually seek to acquire complementary businesses  as appropriate  when we believe those businesses are fairly valued and fit into our growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of the strategic initiatives described above 
a number of risks will challenge us in meeting our long term objectives 
we describe certain of these risks  such as competition and our reliance on economically sensitive markets  under item a 
risk factors and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we intend to manage these risks actively  but there can be no assurance of our success to do so 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes relevant aspects of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to select accounting policies that are appropriate for our business  and to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain in applying those policies 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our financial statements are based in part upon critical accounting policies that involve complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the members of the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our selection of accounting policies has resulted in actual results approximating the estimated amounts in each respective area 
these policies are discussed below and also in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the discussion which follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
valuation of accounts receivable we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
our customer base is diverse and includes customers located throughout the world 
payment terms in certain of the foreign countries in which we do business are longer than those that are customary in the us  and  as a result  may give rise to additional credit risk related to outstanding accounts receivable from these non us customers 
likewise  a change in the financial position  liquidity or prospects of any of our customers could have an impact on our ability to collect amounts due 
while concentrations of credit risk related to trade receivables are somewhat limited by our large customer base  we do extend significant credit to some of our customers 
we make estimates of the amounts of our gross accounts receivable that will not be collectible  and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of accounts receivable to the amount that is expected to be realized 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon our historical bad debt experience  a review of the overall aging of the accounts  and an analysis of specific customer accounts  particularly those with past due balances 
the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to cover specific customer collection issues identified by management at the balance sheet date and to provide for potential losses from other accounts based on our historical experience 
increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an expense and included in general  selling and administrative expenses in the period identified 
our estimate of the required allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes in customer payment patterns  dynamics of the industries in which we operate  our judgments about the future collectibility of customer accounts  and other factors 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
in addition  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and evaluate significant items to determine whether they are excess or obsolete 
we record the value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense in cost of sales in the period it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes in estimates of the future demand for inventory  customer purchasing behaviors  competition  and other factors 
our process to evaluate inventories for excess or obsolete items is comprehensive 
we quantify the amount of inventory on hand that  based on projected demand  is not anticipated to be sold within the next to months or  based on our current product offerings  is excess or obsolete 
this involves a review by sales and production management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory is complete 
factors which impact this evaluation include  for example  whether there has been a change in the market or packaging for particular products  and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete formulations or technology 
in certain businesses in which we are engaged  such as our domestic cat litter and personal care business  product and packaging changes can occur rapidly and expose us to excess and obsolete inventories 
goodwill and long lived assets our goodwill and intangible assets have largely arisen from business combinations or acquisitions that we have completed 
we follow the guidance in accounting standard codification asc topic related to business combinations when initially recognizing the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination 
under these guidelines  we are required to recognize the fair value of the intangible assets we acquire in a business combination 
these are typically customer related assets  trademarks and trade names and non compete agreements 
we are required to make significant estimates as to the nature of these customer relationships including future profitability and longevity of the relationships 
we are also required to make significant estimates regarding the probability and impact of competition from former owners or management employees of businesses we acquire 
these estimates are critical as we make them from the viewpoint of a market participant  they involve forecasting future results  and they contain uncertainties regarding the customers served by the acquired business 
for property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  we evaluate the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we perform our impairment assessment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
this assessment is made at the reporting unit level for goodwill and at the individual asset level for indefinite lived intangible assets 
for testing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we primarily use discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair value of our long lived assets 
critical assumptions used in conducting these tests include expectations of our business performance and financial results  useful lives of assets  and discount rates as well as comparable market data 
in conducting our goodwill impairment tests we rely on both the qualitative and the quantitative assessment methodologies 
for the qualitative method  we consider various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units and the level of impact a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value 
for the quantitative method  we primarily use discounted cash flow models to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
critical assumptions used in both these testing methodologies include expectations of our business performance and financial results  and weighted average cost of capital as well as comparable market data and our market capitalization 
in evaluating the recoverability of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we make several critical assumptions as to the applicable market royalty rate and discount rates as well as the future performance of the assets underpinning those intangibles 
our estimates related to the carrying values of these assets are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors and due to the uncontrollable variability of market factors underlying them 
for example  judgment is required to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  in performing assessments of the carrying values of these assets  we must make judgments about our future business  economic  regulatory  and political conditions affecting these assets  appropriate risk related rates for discounting estimated future cash flows  and reasonable estimates of disposal values 
based on business conditions and market values that existed at october   we concluded that no impairment loss was required 
however  the market value of our common stock continues to fluctuate and if  among other factors  our equity value declines  the fair value of our reporting units decline  we don t achieve our expected future results  or the adverse impacts of economic or competitive factors are worse than anticipated  we could conclude in future periods that impairment losses are required in order to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill  other intangible assets  or other long lived assets 
depending on the severity of the changes in the key factors underlying the respective impairment tests  such losses could be significant 
retirement benefits we sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of our us employees hired before january  we also sponsor a supplementary pension plan serp that provides benefits in excess of qualified plan limitations for certain employees 
in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  we estimate various factors used in valuing the associated assets and liabilities  such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
our benefit plan committee determines the key assumptions related to the discount rate  expected investment rate of return  long term rate of compensation increases  and other assumptions based on consultation with our actuaries 
the most important assumptions that affect the computations are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
our discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate for december   we utilized the aon hewitt aa bond universe yield curve  which is a hypothetical double a yield curve comprised of a series of annualized individual spot discount rates  applied to the projected benefit payments for our plans 
the discount rate used to determine our retirement pension benefit obligation at december  was for the qualified defined benefit plan and for our serp 
a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased the benefit obligation at december  by million and would increase our net cost expected in by  or thousand 
likewise at december   a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the benefit obligation by million and would decrease our net cost expected in by  or thousand 
the expected long term rate of return on defined benefit plan assets was based on our current asset allocations and the expected returns based on current capital market assumptions 
information regarding our asset allocations is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
we assumed a weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of to determine our net defined benefit pension plan expense in a basis point decrease in the expected return would increase the net cost expected in by approximately  or thousand 
likewise  a basis point increase in the expected return would decrease the net cost expected in by approximately  or thousand 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on the income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we account for our tax positions in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes codified in asc topic  and thus our effective tax rate includes the impact of changes to our liability for uncertain tax positions 
our estimates of income tax items  expenses and reserves are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on rulings by various taxing authorities  changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income and availability of future tax planning strategies 
on a quarterly basis  these estimates are more critical as they involve estimates of our taxable income expected for the remainder of the fiscal year by taxing jurisdiction 
in addition  our effective tax rate reflects the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us most of the amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us  but would be subject to us federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits or deductions 
valuation allowances are recorded  if necessary  to measure a deferred tax asset at the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming our judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate 
changes in a valuation allowance are recorded in the period when we determine events have occurred that will impact the realizable value of the asset 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter is audited and finally resolved 
audits of our us federal income tax returns have been completed for our income tax returns relating to fiscal years of and prior 
state income tax returns are audited less frequently 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of our cash and could result in the recording of additional tax expense 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our tax provision in the year of resolution 
accounting for long term contracts our construction technologies and energy services segments generate sales and revenues under long term contracts with customers 
where applicable  these revenues and related costs are accounted for under the percentage of completion revenue recognition method whereby revenues are recognized as completion occurs  which can be generally measured by either the costs incurred in relation to the total expected costs to complete the contract or the amount of product installed in relation to the total amount expected to be installed 
in addition  we recognize losses on contracts in the period in which we first forecast a loss will occur on the overall contract 
this revenue recognition methodology requires that we continually update our estimates of the amount of work remaining to complete a contract 
thus  our sales and revenues and related costs are subject to fluctuation depending on changes in estimates of the cost or product required to complete a contract
