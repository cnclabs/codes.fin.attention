acc phase ii was placed into service on january  and of the leases commenced immediately 
one third of the remaining leases is expected to commence later in the first quarter of with the remaining leases expected to commence in the third quarter of leasing update the company derives substantially all of its revenue from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of the operating properties 
because the company believes that critical load is the primary factor used by tenants in evaluating data center requirements  rents are based primarily on the amount of power that is made available to tenants  rather than the amount of space that they occupy 
during  the company executed leases and pre leases representing a total of mw of critical load and  raised square feet of space with an average lease term of years 
four leases were at sc phase i comprising mw of critical load and  raised square feet  three leases were at acc phase i comprising mw of critical load and  raised square feet  three leases were at ch comprising mw of critical load and  raised square feet and two leases were at nj phase i comprising mw of critical load and  raised square feet 
two pre leases were at acc phase ii totaling mw and  raised square feet 
acc phase ii was placed into service on january  in  the company extended the maturity of four leases totaling mw and  raised square feet for a weighted average additional years 
one of these leases was at acc totaling mw and  raised square feet  one lease was at ch totaling mw and  raised square feet  one lease was at acc totaling mw and  raised square feet and one lease was at va totaling mw and  raised square feet 
the base rent of the four extended leases is approximately lower than base rent prior to the extensions  in the aggregate  on a straight line basis 
cash base rent of 
table of contents these four leases will decline approximately at the time the renewal rents take effect compared to current cash rents 
the original lease terms of the four extended leases expire from to and the extended lease terms expire from to for certain of these extensions the company made a strategic decision to agree to cash rent reductions in exchange for obtaining long term lease extensions 
these cash rent reductions will not have an impact on the company cash position in or compared to current rents we receive  but there will be an impact in and future years 
despite these concessions  the company believes these lease extensions were in the best interest of its business  strengthened the relationships with several key tenants  and generated mw of additional leases from these tenants in from january  to february   two tenants have returned space to the company 
one of the tenants had the option to return space with mw of available critical load at ch phase ii and this tenant elected to return space with mw of available critical load before its lease commenced  and its option to return the remaining space has expired 
another tenant restructured two of its four leases with the company and returned space with mw of available critical load before its lease commenced at va and space with mw of available critical load at acc see results of operations below for more discussion on this restructuring 
each of the company leases includes pass through provisions under which tenants are required to pay for their pro rata share of most of the property level operating expenses  such as real estate taxes and insurance commonly referred to as a triple net lease 
in addition  under the company triple net lease structure  tenants pay for only the power they use to run their servers and other computer equipment and power that is used to cool their space 
the company intends to continue to structure future leases as triple net leases 
the company leases also provide it with a property management fee based on a percentage of base rent collected and property level operating expenses  other than charges for power used by tenants to run their servers and cool their space 
also  most of the company leases provide for annual rent increases  generally at a rate of to or a function of the consumer price index 
the company leases space on a long term basis and the company s weighted average remaining lease term for commenced leases was approximately years as of december  although less than of the company s leases in terms of annualized base rent are scheduled to expire through  the company s ability to generate rental income over time will depend on its ability to retain tenants when their leases expire and re lease space available from leases that expire or are terminated at attractive rates 
during the second quarter of  the company second largest tenant  yahoo  elected not to renew one of its leases comprising of the company consolidated annualized base rent as of march  additionally  as noted above  two tenants returned space with a total of mw of available critical load in the company is actively marketing this space  but it can provide no assurances regarding when the space will be re leased or the rates that it will be able to charge for the space  particularly in light of some of the factors discussed below 
market conditions the opportunity for revenue growth in the near term primarily depends on the company ability to lease space in its five operating properties with vacancies nj phase i  sc phase i  ch  va and acc the company takes into account various factors when negotiating the terms of its leases  which can vary among leases  including the following factors the tenant strategic importance  growth prospects and credit quality  the length of the lease term  the amount of power leased and competitive market conditions 
in each of its leased properties  the company has been able to lease vacant space at rates that provide a favorable return on its investment in these facilities 
there appears to be increased pricing pressure in some of the markets in which the company competes  including lower rates and concessions 
it is unclear to what extent this will adversely impact the rental rates  and  in turn  the rates of return of its investment  that the company can obtain as it pursues leasing available space at the five properties listed above 
the returns on the company investments it has achieved to date would be impacted negatively if it is unable to lease vacant space with rents equal to or above its historic rates 
the company receives expense reimbursement from tenants only on space that is leased 
vacant space results in portions of the company operating expenses being unreimbursed  which in turn negatively impacts revenues and net income 
it is difficult for the company to predict the timing for signing and commencing leases for available space 
this uncertainty is particularly true with respect to the leasing of vacant space in data center facilities that are located in new markets for the company nj phase i in piscataway  new jersey and sc phase i in santa clara  california 
the company three largest tenants comprised of its annualized base rent as of december  the company expects these tenants to evaluate their lease expirations in the year before expiration is scheduled to occur  taking into account  among other factors  their anticipated need for server capacity and economic factors 
if the company cannot renew these leases at similar rates or attract replacement tenants on similar terms in a timely manner  the company s rental income could be materially adversely impacted in future periods 

table of contents the company has only different tenants with different lease expirations 
the inability of a tenant to meet its rent obligations could impact us negatively and significantly 
adverse economic and other market conditions could impact the ability of any of the company tenants to fulfill their lease commitments 
for example  as discussed below in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating expenses  in  we established a million receivables reserve related to one tenant that restructured its lease obligations with us and  as part of the restructuring  converted its outstanding accounts receivable and deferred rent receivable related to space that this tenant returned to us into a note receivable 
the inability of this tenant to satisfy its obligations to us under the note or its lease agreements with us could result in additional charges  the amounts of which could be significant  which would impact our results of operations and financial condition negatively 
the company taxable reit subsidiary trs  df technical services  llc  generates revenue by providing certain technical services to the company tenants on a non recurring contract or purchase order basis  which the company refers to as a la carte services 
such services include the installation of circuits  racks  breakers and other tenant requested items 
the trs will generally charge tenants for these services on a cost plus basis 
because the degree of utilization of the trs for these services varies from period to period depending on the needs of the tenants for technical services  the company has limited ability to forecast future revenue from this source 
moreover  as a taxable corporation  the trs is subject to federal  state and local corporate taxes and is not required to distribute its income  if any  to the company for purposes of making additional distributions to dft stockholders 
because demand for its services is unpredictable  the company anticipates that the trs may retain a significant amount of its cash to fund future operations  and therefore the company does not expect to receive distributions from the trs on a regular basis 
in the current economic environment  certain types of real estate have experienced declines in value 
if this trend were to be experienced by any of the company data centers  the company may have to write down the value of that data center  which would result in the company recording a charge against earnings 
results of operations this annual report on form k contains stand alone audited financial statements and other financial data for each of dft and the operating partnership 
dft is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and  as of december   owned of the common economic interests in the operating partnership  of which approximately is held as general partnership units

critical accounting policies the company has provided a summary of its significant accounting policies in note to its financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company describes below those accounting policies that it deems critical and requires material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
the company management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof 
revenue recognition 
rental income is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases  which commences when control of the space and the critical power have been provided to the tenant 
deferred rent included in the company consolidated balance sheets represents the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual rental payments that will be recognized under the remaining terms of the leases 
the company leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse it for a portion of property operating expenses it incurs 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
the company recognizes amortization of the value of acquired above market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue and of below market leases as an increase to rental revenue 
the company must make subjective estimates as to when its revenue is earned  including a determination of the lease commencement date for accounting purposes  the existence of lease inducements and early termination clauses with penalty payments and the collectability of its accounts receivable related to rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements and other income 
the company analyzes individual accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
capitalization of costs 
the company capitalizes direct and indirect costs related to construction and development  including property taxes  insurance and financing costs relating to properties under development 
in addition  the company ceases cost capitalization after a development is placed in service and a certificate of occupancy is obtained  or if development of a project is suspended 
the company capitalizes pre acquisition costs related to probable property acquisitions and writes off these costs if the acquisition of the property or development of the project is no longer deemed probable 
the selection of costs to capitalize and the determination of whether a proposed acquisition is probable are subjective and depends on many assumptions including the timing of potential acquisitions and the probability that future acquisitions occur 
variations in these assumptions would yield different amounts of capitalized costs in the periods presented 
all capital improvements for the income producing properties that extend the property useful life are capitalized 
for the years ended december   and  the company capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of internal development and leasing costs on all of its data centers 
useful lives of assets 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the major components of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to its investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company net income 
the following presents the major components of the company properties and the useful lives over which they are depreciated 

table of contents component average of total component life years land n a building improvements electrical structure power distribution units electrical structure uninterrupted power supply electrical structure switchgear transformers fire protection security systems mechanical structure heating  ventilating and air conditioning mechanical structure chiller pumps building automation mechanical structure chilled water storage and pipes total weighted average life the company regularly performs preventive maintenance on its data center components to ensure continual operation and avoid downtime at its data centers 
these maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and included as property operating costs in the company consolidated statement of operations 
the company triple net leases provide for the reimbursement of the tenant share of these costs and the reimbursements are included as recoveries from tenants on the company consolidated statement of operations 
asset impairment evaluation 
the company reviews the carrying value of its net real estate on a quarterly and annual basis 
the company bases its review on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment use and eventual disposition 
the company considers factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if the company evaluation indicates that it may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property  which would result in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows from properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  the company strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if this strategy changes or market conditions dictate an earlier sale date or if the company determines that development of a project is no longer viable  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if the company determines that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
the company estimates the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 
funds from operations year ended december  in thousands net income depreciation and amortization less non real estate depreciation and amortization ffo funds from operations  or ffo  is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure for reits 
the company calculates ffo in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap  impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating 
table of contents real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because  in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared period over period  captures trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating expenses 
the company also believes that  as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity reits  ffo may be used by investors as a basis to compare the company s operating performance with that of other reits 
however  because ffo excludes real estate related depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company s properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company s properties  all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company s results from operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of the company s performance is limited 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo and  accordingly  ffo as disclosed by such other reits may not be comparable to the company s ffo 
therefore  the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or to cash flow from operating activities each as computed in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to meet the company s cash needs  including its ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
related party transactions leasing arrangements as of december   the company leased approximately  square feet of office space in washington  dc  an office building owned by entities affiliated with dft chairman of the board and president and chief executive officer 
this lease expires in september the company believes that the terms of this lease are fair and reasonable and reflect the terms it could expect to obtain in an arm length transaction for comparable space elsewhere in washington  dc rent expense under this lease was million for the year ended december  aircraft charter from time to time during  the company chartered an aircraft owned by its president and ceo  at rates that the company believes are fair and reasonable and reflect the terms that it would expect to obtain in an arm length transaction for use of a comparable aircraft 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a total of million of costs under charters of this aircraft for business related travel of the company 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a total of million of expenses for personal travel by the president and ceo paid for by the company in lieu of the ceo annual salary under the terms of his employment agreement 
effective february   the company will no longer reimburse the ceo for personal travel in lieu of salary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s variable rate debt consists of the acc term loan and the unsecured credit facility 
the acc term loan bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin and the unsecured credit facility bears interest at a rate equal to libor or a base rate which is either a prime rate or a federal funds rate plus an applicable margin 
if interest rates were to increase by  the increase in interest expense on the company s variable rate debt outstanding as of december  would decrease future net income and cash flows by million annually less the impact of capitalization of interest incurred on the company s net income 
because one month libor was approximately at december   a decrease of would increase future net income and cash flows by million annually less the impact of capitalization of interest incurred on the company s net income 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  the company may take specific actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in the company s financial structure 
the company believes that it has effectively managed interest rate exposure because the majority of its indebtedness bears a fixed 
table of contents rate of interest 
at december   of the company s indebtedness was fixed rate debt 
the company also utilizes preferred stock to raise capital  the dividends required under the terms of which have a coupon rate that is fixed 
pursuant to the acc term loan agreement  the operating partnership is required to enter into an interest rate protection agreement upon the earlier to occur of i days following the date on which us dollar one month libor equals or exceeds or ii the occurrence of a default under the acc term loan
