the company also uses independent construction inspectors as well as mortgage brokers and deal initiators 
the company generally grants loans for a term of one year 
in certain situations the company and its borrowers have mutually agreed to the extension of the loans as a result of the downturn in the economy and the real estate industry in the new york metropolitan area 
potential buyers of the real estate serving as collateral for the short term loans may have difficulty securing financing due to restrictions imposed by financial institutions resulting from the recent mortgage crisis

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management will base the use of estimates on a a preset number of assumptions that consider past experience  b future projections  and c general financial market conditions 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company recognizes revenues in accordance with asc  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
asc outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
in general  the company recognizes revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the product has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
interest income from commercial loans is recognized  as earned  over the loan period 
origination fee revenue on commercial loans is amortized over the term of the respective note 
the company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
there are also areas in which in management judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result
