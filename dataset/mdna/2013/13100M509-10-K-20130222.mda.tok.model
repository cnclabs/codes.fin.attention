overview we are a leading provider in north america of broadband communications access systems and software for fiber and copper based network architectures that enable communications service providers to connect to their residential and business subscribers 
we enable csps to provide a wide range of revenue generating services  from basic voice and data to advanced broadband services  over legacy and next generation access networks 
we focus solely on csp access networks  the portion of the network that governs available bandwidth and determines the range and quality of services that can be offered to subscribers 
we develop and sell carrier class hardware and software products  which is referred to as the unified access portfolio that are designed to enhance and transform csp access networks to meet the changing demands of subscribers rapidly and cost effectively 
we market our access systems and software to csps globally through our direct sales force as well as a limited number of resellers 
as of december   over sixteen million ports of our unified access portfolio have been deployed at more than  csps worldwide  whose networks serve over million subscriber lines in total 
our customers include many of the world largest communications providers 
in addition  we have over commercial video customers and have enabled over customers to deploy gigabit passive optical network  active ethernet and point to point ethernet fiber access networks 
our revenue increased from million for to million for  and then decreased to million for in  our revenues increased over primarily due to higher shipment revenue resulting from an increase in our customer base from the occam acquisition 
however in the second half of fiscal  we experienced a slowdown in business primarily related to continued delays in broadband stimulus awards under the american recovery and reinvestment act of becoming shippable orders due to challenges that a number of our awarded customers were facing in navigating some of the bureaucratic hurdles of the program 
other factors that contributed to this slowdown include reduced investment in the traditional networks at one of our major customers  the competitive environment  weak macro economic conditions and fiber shortages in certain portions of the market caused by the tsunami in northern japan 
during the first half of  we experienced continued softness in our business due to lower demand across multiple customer markets 
we believe this was due to a slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers increasingly concerned about macro economic conditions and uncertainties associated with the implementation of regulatory reforms 
we experienced steady improvement during the remainder of and completed the year with stronger results compared to the first half of revenue growth will depend on our ability to continue to sell our access systems and software to existing customers and to attract new customers  including in particular  those customers in the large csp and international markets 
additionally  we expect our acquisition of ericsson fiber access assets to have a positive impact to revenue beyond since our inception we have incurred significant losses  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of 
table of contents million 
our net loss was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
revenue fluctuations result from many factors  including but not limited to increases or decreases in customer orders for our products and services  large customer purchase agreements with delayed revenue recognition  varying budget cycles for our customers and seasonal buying patterns of our customers 
more specifically  our customers tend to spend less in the first fiscal quarter as they are finalizing their annual budgets 
customers then typically begin to purchase more products during our second and third fiscal quarters 
finally  in our fourth fiscal quarter  customer purchases typically increase as they are attempting to spend the rest of their budget for the year 
as of december   our deferred revenue of million primarily included certain contracts with customers who receive government supported loans and grants from the us department of agriculture s rural utility service rus that include installation services  services  special customer arrangements and ratably recognized services 
the timing of deferred recognition may cause significant fluctuations in our revenue and operating results from period to period 
cost of revenue is strongly correlated to revenue and will tend to fluctuate from all of the aforementioned factors that could impact revenue 
other factors that impact cost of revenue include changes in the mix of products delivered to our customers and changes in the cost of our inventory 
cost of revenue includes fixed expenses related to our internal operations  which could impact our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue if there are large sequential fluctuations to revenue 
our gross profit and gross margin have been  and will likely be  impacted by several factors  including new product introduction or upgrades to existing products  changes in customer mix  changes in the mix of products demanded and sold  shipment volumes  changes in our product costs  changes in pricing and the extent of customer rebates and incentive programs 
we believe our gross margin could increase due to favorable changes in these factors  for example  increases in sales of our advanced e series ethernet service access platforms  upgrades to our c platform  new introductions of our p series optical network terminals and reductions in the impact of rebate or similar programs 
we believe our gross margin could decrease due to unfavorable changes in factors such as increased product costs  pricing decreases due to competitive pressure and an unfavorable customer or product mix 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on our future average selling prices and unit costs 
also  the timing of deferred revenue recognition and related deferred costs can have a material impact on our gross profit and gross margin results 
the timing of recognition and the relative size of these arrangements could cause large fluctuations in our gross profit from period to period 
our operating expenses have fluctuated based on the following factors timing of variable compensation expenses due to fluctuations in order volumes  timing of salary increases which have historically occurred in the second quarter  timing of bonus accrual due to changes in the company s performance  timing of research and development expenses including prototype builds and intermittent outsourced development projects  and increases in stock based compensation expenses resulting from modifications to outstanding stock options 
our operating expenses for fiscal include acquisition related expenses and amortization of intangible assets from our acquisition of ericsson fiber access assets as discussed in more detail below 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase but will decline as a percentage of revenue over time 
as a result of the fluctuations described above and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control  our annual operating results fluctuate from year to year 
you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
acquisition of ericsson fiber access assets on november   we acquired the fiber access assets of ericsson  including the ericsson eda gpon solution and its complementary ont portfolio  under an asset purchase agreement 
total consideration for the purchase was million in cash 
as a result of this acquisition  calix hired us based employees of ericsson  and transitioned ongoing support of the acquired products from ericsson to calix 
in connection with this acquisition  calix and ericsson also signed a non exclusive global reseller agreement  under which calix became ericsson preferred global partner for broadband access applications 
we expect this partnership to provide calix with an extensive new global reseller channel  and we believe our acquisition of ericsson fiber access portfolio delivers powerful new complements to our industry leading unified access portfolio 
we expect that this partnership will also provide ericsson existing fiber access customers with world class support and maintenance  and an expanded portfolio of access systems and software from a leading company totally focused on access 
the transaction is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the accounting standard for business combinations 
we have included the financial results of the acquired ericsson fiber access assets in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
see note  business combinations of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information related to this acquisition 
we expect the acquisition to have a positive impact on our international business over time 
acquisition of occam networks on february   we completed our acquisition of occam  a provider of innovative broadband access products designed to enable telecom service providers to offer bundled voice  video and high speed internet  or triple play  services over both fiber optic and copper networks in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately million which consisted of million of cash consideration and a value of million of common stock and equity awards issued 
the combined organization provides csps globally with an enhanced portfolio of advanced broadband access systems  and accelerates innovation across our expanded unified access portfolio 
the acquisition resulted in more access options over both fiber and copper for csps to deploy  which could expedite the proliferation of advanced broadband services to both residential and business subscribers  including such services as high speed internet  iptv  voip  ethernet business services  and other advanced broadband applications 

table of contents as a result of this acquisition  we recorded million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets 
we are amortizing the finite lived intangible assets over their useful lives 
see critical accounting policies and use of estimates valuation of goodwill and intangible assets section below for information relating to these items and our test for impairment 
under purchase accounting rules  we revalued the occam assets and liabilities acquired at the time of the acquisition  based on their fair value 
see note  business combinations of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information related to this acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
business combination we accounted for our business acquisitions under accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations 
under this guidance  all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
if a business combination results in a bargain purchase for us  the economic gain resulting from the fair value received being greater than the purchase price is recorded as a gain included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
prior to recognizing the gain  we reassess whether we have correctly identified all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognize any additional assets or liabilities that result from that review 
we also review the measurement procedures used in valuing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of calculating the fair value at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
these assumptions and estimates include a market participant s use of the asset and an appropriate discount rate 
our estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
our significant assumptions and estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we may record adjustments retrospectively to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill as of the acquisition date  or other income or expense in the case of a bargain purchase for the period of the acquisition 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale of hardware products and related software 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we generally rely upon sales agreements and customer purchase orders as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we use the shipping terms of the arrangement or evidence of customer acceptance to verify delivery or performance 
sales price is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
payment terms to customers can range from net to net days 
collectability is reasonably assured 
we assess collectability based primarily on creditworthiness of customers and their payment histories 
revenue from installation and training services are recognized as the services are completed 
post sales software support revenue and extended warranty services revenue are deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
to date  service revenue has comprised an insignificant portion of our revenue and we have not reported service revenue separately from product revenue in our financial statements 
in instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in the customer agreement  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
from time to time  we offer customers sales incentives  which include volume rebates and discounts 
these amounts are estimated on a quarterly basis and recorded net of revenue 
we enter into arrangements with certain of our customers who receive government supported loans and grants from the rus to finance capital spending 
under the terms of an rus equipment contract that includes installation services  the customer does not take possession and control and title does not pass until formal acceptance is obtained from the customer 
under this type of arrangement  we do not recognize revenue until we have received formal acceptance from the customer 
for rus arrangements that do not involve installation services  we recognize revenue in accordance with the revenue recognition policy described above 
our products contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality 
when we enter into sales arrangements that consist of multiple deliverables of our product and service offerings  we allocate the total 
table of contents consideration of the arrangement to each separable deliverable based on their relative selling price 
we limit the amount allocable to delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting specified performance conditions  and recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our revenue policy 
the determination of selling price for each deliverable is based on a selling price hierarchy  which is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
vsoe of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices of an element fall within a narrow range when each element is sold separately 
we have established vsoe for our training and post sales software support services based on the normal pricing practices of these services when sold separately 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating whether there are similar competitor products or services that are sold in stand alone sales transaction to similarly situated customers 
generally  our marketing strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of customization and differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
additionally  as we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis  we are not typically able to determine tpe 
esp is established considering multiple factors including  but not limited to geographies market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives  characteristics of targeted customers and pricing practices 
the determination of esp is made through consultation with and formal approval by management  taking into consideration the go to market strategy 
stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation  stock based awards are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized to expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period  which we have elected to amortize on a straight line basis 
we value restricted stock units rsus and restricted stock awards rsas at the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of performance restricted stock units prsus with a market condition is estimated on the date of grant  using a monte carlo simulation model to estimate the total return ranking of our common stock in relation to the peer group over each performance period 
compensation cost on prsus with a market condition is not adjusted for subsequent changes in the company stock performance or the level of ultimate vesting 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase rights at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires the use of highly judgmental assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and expected life of option awards  which have a significant impact on the fair value estimates and are discussed in detail in note  stockholders equity of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
changes to these estimates will cause the fair values of our stock options and related stock based compensation expense that we record to vary 
in addition  we apply an estimated forfeiture rate to awards granted and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant based on our historical experience 
further  to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  stock based compensation is adjusted accordingly 
inventory valuation inventory consisting of finished goods purchased from contract manufacturers is stated at the lower of cost  determined by the first in  first out method  or market value 
we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record write downs for excess and obsolete inventories based on our estimate of demand for our products  potential obsolescence of technology  product life cycle and whether pricing trends or forecasts indicate that the carrying value of inventory exceeds our estimated selling price 
these factors are impacted by market and economic conditions  technology changes and new product introductions and require estimates that may include elements that are uncertain 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and may have a material effect on gross margins 
if inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established that cannot be increased in future periods 
the sale of previously reserved inventory has not had a material impact on our gross margins 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
we record a specific allowance based on an analysis of individual past due balances 
additionally  based on historical write offs and our collection experience  we record an additional allowance based on a percentage of outstanding receivables 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
these evaluations require significant judgment and are based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  payment history and a financial review of the customer 
warranty we offer limited warranties for our hardware products for a period of one or five years  depending on the product type 
we recognize estimated costs related to warranty activities as a component of cost of revenue upon product shipment 
the estimates are based on historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
the recorded amount is adjusted from time to time for specifically identified warranty exposure 
actual warranty expenses are charged against our estimated warranty liability when incurred 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized but instead is subject to an annual impairment test or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the end of the second quarter of each year 
management has 
table of contents determined that we operate as a single reporting unit and  therefore  evaluates goodwill impairment at the enterprise level 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
to evaluate for impairment  we compare the company fair value to its carrying value including goodwill 
we determine the company fair value using both an income approach and a market approach 
under the income approach  we determine the fair value based on estimated future cash flows  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the company and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
under the market based approach  we utilize information regarding the company as well as publicly available industry information to determine earnings multiples that are used to value the company 
if the carrying value of the company exceeds its fair value  we will test to determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value 
we completed the annual goodwill impairment test as of june  in july and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets for a detailed discussion 
there have been no significant events or circumstances affecting the valuation of goodwill subsequent to the annual impairment test performed in july as of december   there was no impairment to the carrying value of our goodwill 
in addition  there were no impairment losses for goodwill during and intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful life  generally years 
we periodically evaluate intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may have occurred 
if such events or changes in circumstances arise  we compare the carrying amount of the intangible assets to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the estimated aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the intangible assets  an impairment charge  calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets  is recorded 
the fair value of intangible assets is determined based on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to be generated from the assets 
we have reviewed events and changes to our business during the year and have determined that there was no impairment to our intangible assets during we did not incur any impairment losses for intangible assets during and income taxes we evaluate our tax positions and estimate our current tax exposure in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this includes assessing the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  which are calculated based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carry forwards are utilized 
since realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is below the more likely than not threshold  we must establish a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
since inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of million and million 
the us federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in and through if not utilized 
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in and through  if not utilized 
additionally  we have us federal and state research and development credits of million and million as of december  the credits have varying expiration dates between and with california credits having no expiration 
these two items account for the bulk of our net deferred tax asset of million as of december  excluding our foreign operations  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred assets at each balance sheet date presented 
we believe that based on the available evidence and history of operating losses  it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets before expiration 
we intend to maintain the full valuation allowances until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
results of operations for years ended december   and revenue the following table sets forth our revenue in thousands  except for percentages years ended december  vs change vs change revenue our revenue is principally derived in the united states 
during   and  revenue generated in the united states represented approximately  and  respectively 
compared to revenue decreased in compared with by million  or  primarily due to a decrease in shipment volume during the first half of the year resulting from the softness in demand across multiple customer markets which we believe was due to a slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers increasingly concerned about macro economic conditions and uncertainties 
table of contents associated with the implementation of regulatory reforms 
in the first half of  revenue decreased by million as compared to the same period of these issues began to subside in the second half of and our shipment volume and revenue increased accordingly 
compared to revenue increased by million from million in to million in primarily due to an increase in our customer base as a result of the occam acquisition 
our revenue in the second half of the fiscal was impacted by a slowdown in business primarily related to continued delays in broadband stimulus awards under the american recovery and reinvestment act of becoming shippable orders due to challenges that a number of our awarded customers are facing in navigating some of the bureaucratic hurdles of the program 
other factors that contributed to this slowdown include reduced investment in the traditional networks at one of our major customers  the competitive environment  weak macro economic conditions and fiber shortages in certain portions of the market caused by the tsunami in northern japan 
cost of revenue and gross profit our cost of revenue is comprised of the following products and services revenue cost of products revenue includes the inventory costs of our products that have shipped  accrued warranty costs for our standard warranty program  outbound freight costs to deliver products to our customers  overhead from our manufacturing operations cost centers  including stock based compensation  and other manufacturing related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory 
we outsource our manufacturing to third party manufacturers 
inventory costs are estimated using standard costs  which reflect the cost of historical direct labor  direct overhead and materials used to build our inventory 
cost of services revenue includes direct installation material costs  direct costs from third party installers  professional service costs  repair fees charged by our outsourced repair contractors to refurbish product returns under an extended warranty or per incident repair agreement  and other miscellaneous costs to support our services 
acquisition related expenses acquisition related expenses are primarily related to inventory acquired from occam that was revalued to its estimated fair value and was amortized to cost of revenue as the inventory was sold 
we amortized million related to the revaluation of inventory during additionally  we incurred charges of million during for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the occam acquisition 
amortization of acquired intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of occam in and osi in  we recorded amortizable intangible assets of million and million respectively  which included core developed technologies  purchase order backlog and the trade name 
these amounts are amortized to cost of revenue over their estimated useful lives 
the intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of osi had been fully amortized during the first quarter of in addition  we acquired million in process technology from occam 
at the end of the first quarter of  upon the completion of the research and development efforts associated with this in process technology  we determined that this technology had a useful life of years and therefore reclassified it as core developed technology and began amortizing this intangible asset to cost of revenue during the second quarter of the following table sets forth our cost of revenue in thousands  except for percentages years ended december  vs change vs change cost of revenue products and services acquisition related expenses amortization of intangible assets total cost of revenue gross profit gross margin compared to cost of revenue decreased in compared with by million  or  which is due to the fact that we did not incur any associated acquisition related expenses subsequent to  a decrease in cost of products and service revenues  and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets 
the decrease in cost of products and service revenues was a result of decreased revenue  increased order volumes  and decreased write down charges for excess and obsolete inventory as a result of improved inventory management the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in is primarily attributable to the completion of the amortization of certain intangibles in that we acquired from occam and osi  offset in part by the amortization of the core developed technology that was reclassified from in process technology in the first quarter of as discussed above 
gross margin increased in compared with  primarily due to the absence of acquisition related expenses  lower excess and obsolete inventory write down charges  and lower intangible assets amortization expenses 
excluding acquisition related expenses and intangible asset amortization  gross margin increased during to from in  primarily due to a combination of product mix and cost reductions 
in  we shipped more higher margin e series platforms as compared to compared to cost of revenue increased from million to million for the fiscal compared with the corresponding periods of fiscal  primarily due to an increase in revenues recognized during this period  acquisition related expenses and the amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in addition we experienced a significant increase in the excess and obsolete inventory write downs in the third quarter of fiscal primarily due to end of life inventory and excess parts held by us and our contract manufacturer 

table of contents gross margin decreased during  primarily due to higher acquisition related expenses and intangible asset amortization when compared to the corresponding period of fiscal during fiscal  gross margin decreased primarily due to the acquisition related expenses primarily related to revaluation of inventory acquired in our acquisition of occam 
excluding acquisition related expenses and intangible asset amortization  gross margin increased during to from in  primarily due to cost reductions  change in product mix  and within product mix the introduction of many new products in operating expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and include personnel costs  consulting services  depreciation on lab equipment  costs of prototypes and overhead allocations 
we generally expense research and development costs as incurred  since the costs of software development that we incur after a product has reached technological feasibility are not material 
the following table sets forth our research and development expenses in thousands  except for percentages years ended december  vs change vs change research and development percent of total revenue compared to research and development expenses decreased in compared with by million  or  primarily due to a decrease in prototype expenses resulting from the timing of new product development activities  and a decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting from rsus granted in a company wide stock option exchange program  which were fully vested by may these decreases were offset in part by an increase in compensation expenses due to increased headcount resulting from the acquisition of ericsson fiber access assets on november  and the expansion of our china development center 
in connection with our efaa acquisition that was completed in november  we anticipate that we will incur increased compensation costs within research and development due to additional headcount and increased facility related costs associated with our new san jose facility 
to mitigate this increase in facility expenses  we are actively seeking to sublease our fremont facility that is estimated to be vacated in march we are continuing our strategic investments in our unified access portfolio 
we intend to continue to dedicate significant resources to research and development and to develop new product capabilities to support the performance  scalability and management of our unified access portfolio 
compared to research and development expenses increased million from million for to million for  primarily due to an increase in compensation and related costs  including travel related expenses  from an increase in headcount  and an increase in depreciation and facilities related expenses resulting from the acquisition of occam and the expansion of our china development center 
in addition we also experienced an increase in prototype and consulting expenses related to new product development and our pursuit of osmine certification 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting from rsus granted in a company wide stock option exchange program  which began amortizing at the date of our ipo on march   and were fully vested and related stock based compensation expense recognized by may sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs  employee sales commissions and marketing programs 
the following table sets forth our sales and marketing expenses in thousands  except for percentages years ended december  vs change vs change sales and marketing percent of total revenue compared to sales and marketing expenses increased in compared with by million  or  primarily due to an increase in compensation and related costs  an increase in stock based compensation expense  which were primarily driven by an increase in headcount in order to expand our international sales operations 
we will continue our investments in sales and marketing in order to extend our market reach and grow our business in support of our key strategic initiatives 
compared to sales and marketing expenses increased million from million for to million for  primarily due to an increase in compensation and related expenses  including commission and travel related expenses  from an increase in headcount  and an increase in depreciation and facilities related expenses resulting from our acquisition of occam  partially offset by a decrease in corporate bonus plan expense 
in addition we experienced an increase in consulting expenses and an increase in marketing expenses mostly related to increased attendance at our user group and telco tv events that occurred in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and costs for facilities related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations and fees for professional services 
professional services consist of outside legal  tax  and audit services 
the following table sets forth our general and administrative expenses in thousands  except for percentages years ended december  vs change vs change general and administrative percent of total revenue compared to general and administrative expenses decreased in compared with by million  or  primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting from rsus granted in a company wide stock option exchange program  which were fully vested by may these decreases were offset in part by increases in professional service expenses as well as an increase in compensation and related expenses due to increased headcount 
compared to general and administrative expenses decreased million from million for to million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation expense resulting from rsus granted in a company wide stock option exchange program  which began vesting at the date of our ipo on march  and were fully vested in may and a decrease in corporate bonus plan expense 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in compensation and related costs from increased headcount and facilities related and depreciation expenses due to the occam acquisition and a severance payment made to our former chief financial officer in the first quarter of fiscal acquisition related expenses we expense all acquisition related costs as incurred 
these costs generally include outside services for legal and accounting fees  costs associated with consolidating facilities  severance and retention bonuses paid to transitional and certain other employees  and costs for other integration services 
the following table sets forth our acquisition related expenses included in operating expenses in thousands  except for percentages years ended december  vs change vs change acquisition related expenses percent of total revenue compared to acquisition related expenses for and were related to our efaa acquisition and our occam acquisition  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to the magnitude and complexity of the occam acquisition compared to the efaa acquisition 
for the occam acquisition  we incurred significant expenses associated with legal and professional fees  consolidating facilities  severance payments  salaries paid to transitional occam employees  and stock based compensation related to accelerated vesting for certain occam executives who terminated subsequent to the acquisition date 
for the efaa acquisition  the vast majority of the million acquisition related expense consisted of one time payments made to former ericsson employees who transferred to calix as a result of the acquisition 
we do not expect any additional acquisition related expenses going forward for the efaa acquisition 
compared to the increase in acquisition related expenses from to was due to that we completed the occam acquisition in but did not complete any acquisition in the expenses incurred in consisted of legal and professional expenses in connection with our effort to acquire occam 
for more information regarding the aforementioned acquisitions  see note  business combinations of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k

working capital and capital expenditure needs except as disclosed in the contractual obligations and commitments section below  we currently have no material cash commitments  except for normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals  operating leases and firm purchase commitments 
in addition  we believe that our outsourced approach to manufacturing provides us significant flexibility in both managing inventory levels and financing our inventory 
we may be required to issue performance bonds to satisfy requirements under our rus funded contracts 
we issue letters of credit under our existing credit facility to support a portion of these performance bonds 
in the event we do not have sufficient capacity under our credit facility to support these bonds  we will have to purchase certificates of deposit  which could materially impact our working capital or limit our ability to satisfy such contract requirements 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and there was approximately million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had cash of million restricted for the issuance of surety performance bonds we acquired through our acquisition of occam 
at december   there were no restrictions on our cash 
in the event that our revenue plan does not meet our expectations  we may eliminate or curtail expenditures to mitigate the impact on our working capital 
we believe based on our current operating plan  our existing cash  cash equivalents and existing amounts available under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the 
table of contents expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the acquisition of new capabilities or technologies and the continued market acceptance of our products 
in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business  operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
contractual obligations and commitments our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for office space and non cancelable outstanding purchase obligations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activity are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
by policy  we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which was held primarily in cash or money market funds 
due to the nature of these money market funds  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash equivalents as a result of changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk also relates to the amount of interest we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
any outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear a variable rate of interest based upon the applicable libor or prime rate  which is adjusted based on our leverage ratio 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
foreign currency exchange risk in our view  our primary foreign currency exposures are economic  translation  and transaction 
economic exposure the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales and expenses have not been material because they are primarily denominated in us dollars 
however  we are indirectly exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent of our use of foreign contract manufacturers whom we pay in us dollars 
changes in the local currency rates of these vendors in relation to the us dollar could cause an increase in the price of products that we purchase 
additionally  if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies  such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non us customers and thereby reduces demand 
a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect 
the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

table of contents translation exposure our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and  therefore  the majority of our revenues are not subject to foreign currency risk 
we are directly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent such changes affect our expenses related to our foreign assets and liabilities with our subsidiary in china and the united kingdom  whose functional currencies are the chinese renminbi and great british pound sterling  respectively 
our operating expenses are incurred primarily in the united states  with a small portion of expenses incurred in china associated with our research and development operations that are maintained there  and in the united kingdom for our sales and services office there 
our operating expenses are generally denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries in which the operations are located 
for  approximately of our operating expenses were us dollar denominated  and and of our expenses were denominated in british pound and chinese rmb  respectively 
assuming the same currency exchange rates as last year  the negative impact on our operating results was approximately thousand 
if the currencies noted above uniformly fluctuated by plus or minus from the exchange rates as of december   the change in our results of operation for would be immaterial 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any derivative financial instruments 
in the future  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheets 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position for the year ended december  was a net translation gain of approximately thousand 
this gain is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
transaction exposure we have certain assets and liabilities  primarily receivables and accounts payable including inter company transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
in certain circumstances  changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
transaction gains and losses on these foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are recognized each period within other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
during the year ended december   net loss we recognized related to these foreign exchange assets and liabilities was approximately thousand
