item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview telik is engaged in the discovery and development of small molecule drugs 
our business strategy is to advance our drug product candidates through phase clinical studies  and to enter into a partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to assist in further development and commercialization  license product candidates outside our therapeutic focus  and identify and develop additional drug product candidates 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses next year as we continue our research and development activities 
during the year ended december   loss from operations was million and net loss was million 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million and net cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments at december  were million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our expenses consist primarily of those incurred for research and development and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
the process of carrying out the development of our product candidates to later stages of development and our research programs will require significant additional research and development expenditures  including for preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as for manufacturing development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval 
we outsource our clinical trials and our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  non equity payments from collaborative partners and interest income 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including the need for capital  risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  potential competition and retention of key employees 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
we expect that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including the timing and extent of our research and development efforts and the outcome of our clinical trial activities 
the successful development of our product candidates is uncertain 
as such  an accurate prediction of future operating results is difficult or impossible 
going concern our financial statements have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business 
accordingly  they do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
while we were able to raise million through our at market issuance sales agreement  or sales agreement  with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc  or mlv  in and an additional million in the first two months of  we believe our current existing cash resources will only be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the fourth quarter of  including completing patient treatment in our current trials and providing sufficient funds for working capital and general corporate purposes 
however  it is subject to significant uncertainties  including but not limited to  progress on our current clinical development plan with respect to phase placebo controlled randomized registration trial of telintra for the treatment of low to intermediate risk mds and our ability to raise adequate capital to fund this trial as our existing cash resources is limited 
in order to continue as a going concern  we will require substantial 
table of contents additional financing to fund our current and future operations and continue our clinical product development programs  and our ability to continue as a viable entity will be dependent on our ability to obtain funding in a timely manner 
we have been and are currently seeking collaborative arrangements with corporate partners to fund the development and commercialization of telintra 
we have evaluated options to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings and sales transactions as well as other sources such as research grants from non profit organizations and cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in obtaining additional funding 
in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding within next two to three quarters to enable us to commence a phase registration trial of telintra  we will be required to focus on other strategic alternatives including the further restructuring of our operations to conserve resources  the sale of company assets  in whole or in part  ceasing operations  or some other arrangement through which the value of our assets to stockholders could be optimized 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
clinical product development telintra  our lead drug product candidate in clinical development  is a small molecule glutathione analog inhibitor of the enzyme glutathione s transferase p  or gst p we are developing telintra for the treatment of blood disorders that are characterized by defects in blood formation with associated low blood cell levels  such as anemia  neutropenia or thrombocytopenia 
we completed an patient phase clinical trial of telintra tablets  for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds  a hematologic cancer characterized by ineffective red blood cell production requiring large numbers of transfusions to support the patient 
we presented the results at the annual meeting of the american society of hematology  or ash  in december in the second quarter of  we initiated a phase trial of telintra in patients with severe chronic neutropenia  or scn  a rare blood disorder characterized by low levels of circulating white blood cells resulting in patients having multiple life threatening infections 
due to the scarcity of scn patients and our focus on mds  we plan to terminate this study once the last remaining patients complete treatment around the second quarter of in  we initiated two phase clinical trials to evaluate telintra in patients with revlimid refractory or resistant  deletion q mds  and in patients with transfusion dependent  non deletion q mds  who have not been treated with prior hypomethylating agents 
in addition  we completed a phase dose ranging study of telintra tablets in combination with revlimid in patients with mds and presented the results at the annual meeting of ash in december in  we applied for orphan drug eligibility for telintra for the treatment of mds and were granted that designation by the us food and drug administration  or fda  in january we also completed an end of phase meeting with the fda in january and a preliminary agreement was reached regarding the design of a phase placebo controlled randomized registration trial of telintra for the treatment of low to intermediate risk mds  using red blood cell transfusion independence as the endpoint 
in accordance with the fda s guidance  we plan to complete the design of the phase registration trial by the end of the first quarter of in order to focus our resources on the telintra mds registration program  we have decided to stop further enrollment in our ongoing phase exploratory trials mentioned above 
we will require substantial additional capital in order to initiate a phase registration trial of telintra and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in obtaining this funding 
telcyta  our other product candidate  is a small molecule cancer drug product candidate designed to be activated in cancer cells 
telcyta has been evaluated in multiple phase and phase clinical trials  including trials using telcyta as monotherapy and in combination regimens in ovarian  non small cell lung  breast and colorectal cancer 
results from these clinical trials indicate that telcyta monotherapy was generally well tolerated  with mostly mild to moderate side effects 
clinical activity was reported in the telcyta phase 
table of contents trials  however  telcyta did not meet its primary endpoints in the phase studies 
in may  we initiated an investigator led study at a single site of telcyta in patients with refractory or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma  diffuse large b cell lymphoma  and multiple myeloma 
based on responses observed  we had planned to expand the study to stage and add a second investigator site in the first quarter of however  in an effort to focus our resources on telintra development  we have decided to terminate this study 
preclinical drug product development tlk aurora kinase vegfr inhibitors we have a small molecule compound inhibiting both aurora kinase and vegfr kinase 
aurora kinase is a signaling enzyme whose function is required for cancer cell division  while vegf plays a key role in tumor blood vessel formation  ensuring an adequate supply of nutrients to support tumor growth 
the lead compounds of our first dual inhibitor program met a development milestone in august by demonstrating anticancer activity in preclinical models of human colon cancer and human leukemia 
these lead compounds prevented tumor growth in preclinical models of human colon cancer and human leukemia by inhibiting both aurora kinase and vegfr kinase 
our data support the concept that dual inhibition of aurora kinase and vegfr kinase represents a promising approach for anticancer therapy 
a development drug product candidate  tlk  has been selected 
while we have conducted some preclinical safety studies  we have decided to place this development program on hold in an effort to conserve resources 
tlk antimitotic agent using our trap technology  we have discovered tlk  a novel  potent small molecule inhibitor of cell division 
tlk inhibits the formation of microtubules that are necessary for cancer cell growth leading to persistent cancer cell block and subsequent cell death at the g m cell cycle 
this compound demonstrates potent broad spectrum anticancer activity against a number of human cancer cells 
this compound also displays oral efficacy in multiple  standard preclinical models of cancer 
since we are currently focused on telintra development  no additional expenditure on this compound is expected for the foreseeable future 
tlk vegfr inhibitor tlk  a potent vgfr kinase inhibitor  blocks the formation of new blood vessels in tumors 
oral administration of tlk to animal models of human colon cancer significantly reduced tumor growth 
since we are currently focused on telintra development  no additional expenditure on this compound is expected for the foreseeable future 
reverse stock split on march   we effected a for reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 
the reverse stock split affected all stockholders of our common stock uniformly and did not materially affect any stockholder s percentage of ownership interest 
the par value of our common stock remains unchanged at per share and the number of authorized shares of common stock remains the same after the reverse stock split 
see notes and in the notes to financial statements for additional information 
nasdaq stock listing compliance on september   we received notification from nasdaq informing us that the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq global market under nasdaq marketplace rule a 
effective january   we transferred the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market 
on april   we received notification from nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
since may   the bid price for our common stock had again fluctuated below the levels required by 
table of contents nasdaq rules for continued listing 
on july   we received notice from nasdaq that the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq capital market 
on february   we received a notification from nasdaq that we regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
on april   we received notice from nasdaq that the bid price of our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq capital market and that we have calendar days  or until october  to regain compliance 
on october   we received notice from nasdaq that we had been provided with an additional day period  or until april   to regain compliance with the minimum per share requirement 
following the for reverse stock split effected on march   we received notification from nasdaq on april  that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain compliance with nasdaq listing requirements 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
fair value measurements we invest our excess cash in money market funds  cash deposits and debt instruments of the us government agency securities 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective 
accounting standards codification  or asc   fair value measurements and disclosure  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  and level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
stock based compensation expense we use the fair value method under asc  compensation stock compensation to account for share based payment awards following the modified prospective method of adoption which provided for certain 
table of contents changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation 
under asc  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
for the years and  the expected volatilities were based solely on historical volatility data as there were insufficient traded option activities resulting from our declining stock price 
we did not use any expected volatility assumptions for as there were no options granted during the year 
the expected term of options granted is based on the simplified method in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  topic d  as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis for estimation 
sab topic d provides guidance to issuers on the method allowed in developing estimates of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with asc sab topic d allows companies to continue to use the simplified method  under certain circumstances  beyond december  asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we evaluate our forfeiture rate to reflect actual historical and expected cancellations of unvested options periodically 
see note in the notes to financial statements for further information 
if factors change and we develop different assumptions in the application of asc in future periods  the compensation expense that we will then record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
exit and disposal activities we record costs and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities  as defined in asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  at fair value in the period the liability is incurred 
asc requires that the estimated future cash flows to be used in the fair value calculation be discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate and that such interest rate shall have a maturity date that approximates the expected timing of future cash flows 
future cash flows related to lease obligations shall include the effect of sublease rental income and other lease operating expenses 
in addition  accretion of the liability due to the passage of time is recorded as a general and administrative expense 
see note in the notes to financial statements for further information 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits costs  fees for contractors  consultants and third party contract research organizations  and an allocation of facility and administrative costs 
research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for drug and product development  manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates  and preclinical studies 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the on going development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiation and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed during a given period of time over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with third party contract research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and third party service providers of the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services in each agreement 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the third party organizations as measured by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record 
table of contents significant research and development expenses in future periods 
conversely  over estimation of activity levels could result in accrued expenses being reversed in future periods 
use of estimates in preparing our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
results of operations revenues we had no collaborative research agreements in  and and currently do not expect to record any revenue in the next twelve months 
future non product revenues  if any  will depend upon the extent to which we enter into new collaborative research agreements and the amounts of payments relating to such agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
our research and development activities consist primarily of drug development  clinical supply manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates and preclinical studies 
we group these activities into two major categories research and preclinical and clinical development 
the costs associated with research and preclinical and clinical development activities approximate the following years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages research and preclinical clinical development total research and development total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following decreased costs of approximately million associated with headcount reduction  and reduced consulting and stock compensation expenses  decreased clinical trial expenses of approximately  related to the completion of our phase telintra tablets for mds studies   related to the wind down of our phase dose ranging trial of telintra tablets in combination with revlimid in mds and phase telcyta trial in multiple myeloma clinical studies  and decreased clinical drug supply manufacturing costs of  offset by increased clinical development expenses of approximately  for our ongoing phase clinical trial to evaluate telintra tablets in patients with revlimid refractory or resistant  deletion q myelodysplastic syndrome  or del q mds and our phase b clinical trial to evaluate telintra tablets in patients with transfusion dependent  non deletion q mds 

table of contents total research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following decreased costs of approximately million associated with a workforce reduction as a result of our november restructuring plan and reduced facility costs as we relocated our corporate offices to a smaller facility in november  and decreased clinical trial expenses of approximately  related to the completion of our phase telintra tablets for mds and  in clinical drug supply manufacturing costs  offset by increased clinical development expenses of approximately  for our ongoing phase dose ranging study of telintra tablets in combination with lenalidomide in patients with mds and phase telcyta in patients with refractory or relapsed mantle cell lymphoma  diffuse large b cell lymphoma  and multiple myeloma clinical studies 
stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were   and  our total research and development expenditures in the next twelve months will decrease as we stop enrolling new patients in our current phase clinical studies 
we plan to focus our efforts on establishing fda concurrence on the trial design of a phase placebo controlled randomized registration trial of telintra for the treatment of low to intermediate risk mds and seeking additional capital to fund the program 
in the event we are able to obtain sufficient funding to commence our phase registration trial  our total research and development expenditures will increase 
the following table summarizes our principal drug product candidate development initiatives related r d expenses years ended december  product in thousands telintra telcyta tlk tlk other total research and development expenses other constitutes research and development costs that cannot be allocated to any individual project 
the largest component of our total operating expenses is our on going investment in our research and development activities and  in particular  the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct initial human clinical trials for drug candidates  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate  and filing by the company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a nda for a product candidate to allow commercial distribution of the drug 

table of contents in view of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each product candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these and other factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative the decrease in general and administrative expenses of  or million in  compared to the same period in  was primarily due to a decrease of  in headcount  stock compensation and corporate administrative expenses and a decrease of million in legal and professional services expenses 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses of  or million  in  compared to the same period in  was primarily due to a decrease of million in workforce and corporate administrative expenses as a result of the restructuring plan implemented in november and decreased facility costs of million as we relocated our corporate offices to a smaller facility in november and were partially offset by an increase of  in legal expenses primarily relating to patent renewal activities and the filing of new patent applications 
stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were   and million  respectively 
we expect future general and administrative expenses to decrease as we undertake efforts to conserve cash 
facility exit costs in november  we ceased the use of our facility at porter drive in palo alto  california and subleased the facility to a tenant for the remaining contractual term of our master lease  which is through may we recorded a facility exit charge of million to the statement of operations  which included million of estimated present value of future lease related payments through may  less estimated sublease income  and an impairment charge of million in leasehold improvements for this facility as the facility would not have any future benefits to us and their estimated fair values were determined to be zero  offset by a reduction of  in the balance of deferred rent as of november  at december   we had a remaining facility exit costs liability of approximately million as we paid  in  million in and million in see note in the notes to financial statements for additional information 
restructuring costs we have implemented workforce reductions over the past several years to reduce our operating expenses and to streamline our infrastructure based on our current preclinical and clinical trial projects 
in november  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  for severance costs  health benefits and other personnel related charges relating to a workforce reduction of eleven positions 
we had no further restructuring activities in or see note in the notes to financial statements for additional information 

table of contents interest income and interest expense years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income expense  net interest expense na interest and other income expense  net were   and million for the years ended december   and the decrease of approximately  in compared to the same period in was due primarily to a decrease in investment income resulting from lower investment cash balances as well as low yields in our investments which are mainly held in us government agency securities 
the decrease of approximately million in compared to the same period in was due primarily to a million qualifying therapeutic discovery project grant received from the internal revenue service department of treasury in and a decrease of  in investment income resulting from lower investment cash balances 
interest expense in was solely for interest payments made on our ubs loan 
there were no interest expenses for the years ended december  and as our ubs loan was paid in full in february liquidity and capital resources in millions  except ratios december cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash working capital current ratio year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities sources and uses of cash 
due to the significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  interest earned on investments and equipment lease financings 
at december  we had available cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including obligations of us government agencies and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operations for was million compared to million for the same period in and million in net loss of million in included non cash charges of  for stock based compensation 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a million reduction in accrued facility exit costs due to payments made on our porter drive facility which were partially offset by sublease payments received 
cash used in resulted from net loss of million 
table of contents which included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation and  for depreciation 
cash used in operations was further impacted by an  reduction in accounts payable primarily due to payments related to our office relocation at the end of and a million reduction in accrued facility exit costs due to payments made on our porter drive facility which were partially offset by sublease payments received 
cash used in resulted from net loss of million which included non cash charges of million of facility exit costs associated with the relocation of our principal executive offices  million for stock based compensation and  for depreciation 
the increase in accounts payable balance was offset by reductions in accrued expenses and did not have a significant impact on cash used in operations for cash flows from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities for was million compared to million for and million for cash provided in was primarily from million in investment maturities partially offset by the purchase of available for sale investments of million 
cash provided in was primarily from million in investment maturities and million in investment sales partially offset by the purchase of available for sale investments of million 
cash provided in was primarily from million in investment maturities and million in investment sales which included million in sales of our ars to ubs and was partially offset by the purchase of available for sale investments of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for was approximately million compared to  provided in and million used in financing activities in cash provided by financing activities in was due to net proceeds received from stock sales of million under the sales agreement 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to stock sales which included  in net proceeds received under the sales agreement and approximately  from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and stock options exercise 
cash used in financing activities for was primarily due to million payment of our remaining ubs loan balance on february   offset by  in proceeds from stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
working capital 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to our use of cash for our clinical studies and operating expenses 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  along with the million we raised under the sales agreement during will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into the fourth quarter of  including completing patient treatment in our current trials and providing sufficient funds for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in order to continue as a going concern  we will need sufficient additional capital to fund our operations and continue our clinical product development programs 
we may raise funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  the progress and number of research programs in development  the costs associated with conducting phase clinical trials  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish  and the scope of  any new collaborations  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual property rights  and competing technological and market developments 

table of contents we need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our future operations beyond the fourth quarter of we may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources  including collaborative arrangements  licensing arrangements  public equity markets  private equity financings  and or public or private debt as well as other sources such as research grants from non profit organizations 
in august  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s to offer and sell  from time to time  equity securities in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
on august   we entered into the sales agreement with mlv whereby we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price up to million  from time to time  through mlv as our sales agent 
in conjunction with the sales agreement  mlv would receive compensation based on an aggregate of of the gross proceeds on the sale price per share of our common stock 
any sales made pursuant to the sales agreement are deemed an at the market offering and would be made pursuant to the shelf registration statement on form s for the year ended december   we sold  shares of our common stock through mlv and received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting commissions and other related expenses 
as of december   we had sold  shares of our common stock adjusted for the for reverse stock split effected on march  and received approximately million in net proceeds since entering into the sales agreement 
in the first two months of  we sold  shares of our common stock through mlv and received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting commissions and other related expenses 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on clinical and regulatory events and factors related to financial  economic and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
in addition  our ability to raise additional capital may be dependent upon our continued listing on the nasdaq capital market  and we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain compliance with nasdaq listing requirements 
we cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  any of which could delay or require that we curtail our development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in significant ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
in the event we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funding within next two to three quarters to enable us to commence a phase registration trial of telintra  we will be required to focus on other strategic alternatives including the further restructuring of our operations to conserve resources  the sale of company assets  in whole or in part  ceasing operations  or some other arrangement through which the value of our assets to stockholders could be optimized 
our future contractual obligations at december  are as follows in thousands total after operating leases in november  we entered into arrangements to sublease our facility located at porter drive in palo alto  california  which consists of approximately  square feet of research and office space 
on february   we entered into an agreement with our landlord  are san francisco no 
 llc  or are  pursuant to which the premises at porter drive was voluntarily surrendered  the master lease and sublease were terminated as of february   we were relieved of further obligations under the master lease and further rights to rental income under the sublease  and we agreed to pay a termination fee to are of approximately million 
in addition to the termination fee  if we receive million or more in additional financing  an additional termination fee of million will be due to are  but otherwise forgiven 

table of contents on november   we also entered into an arrangement to sublease a facility at hansen way  palo alto  california in which to relocate our principal executive offices  which such sublease expires on march  given the impending term of such sublease  on february   we entered into a month sublease for office space at geng road  suite  palo alto  california and relocated our corporate offices to this facility 
upon execution of the agreement  we paid sublessor the first month s rent with second month s rent due on march   and deposited into an escrow account approximately  which represents the total rent due for the remaining term 
see note in the notes to financial statements for further information 
as a result of the porter drive lease termination and the geng road sublease agreements  the adjusted operating lease obligation at february  for year is approximately  and none for year and thereafter 
we have a contractual obligation under the terms of our manufacturing supply agreement with amri wherein we are obligated to purchase a majority of our united states requirements for the active ingredient in telcyta for a number of years 
however  we currently do not have any requirements for the active ingredient 
we have agreed on a pricing schedule for such supply  which will be subject to future renegotiation after a defined time period 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k a ii

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk exposure involves forward looking statements 
we do not use or hold derivative financial instruments  however we are exposed to market risk related to changes interest rates and market conditions 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments of shorter maturities 
our marketable securities portfolio is primarily invested in us government agency securities with an average maturity of under one year and a minimum investment grade rating of a or a or better to minimize credit risk 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio and beyond total fair value at december  in thousands  except percentages available for sale securities average interest rate
