item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  key developments and accomplishments 
medicare and medicaid health care programs the congressional budget office cbo estimated that in june  approximately million people were covered by the joint state and federally funded medicaid program and approximately million people were covered by the federally funded medicare program 
of these  approximately million people were dual eligibles 
in addition in  approximately million people were covered by the joint state and federally funded children health insurance program chip program 
medicare medicare is a federal health insurance program that provides eligible persons age and over  and some disabled persons under the age of  certain hospital  medical and prescription drug benefits 
medicare is federally administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
the medicare program consists of four parts  labeled parts a d 
part a hospitalization benefits are provided under part a 
these benefits are financed largely through social security taxes 
beneficiaries are not required to pay any premium for part a benefits 
however  they are still required to pay out of pocket deductibles and coinsurance 
part b benefits for medically necessary services and supplies including outpatient care  doctor services  physical or occupational therapists and home health care are provided under part b 
beneficiaries enrolled in part b are required to pay monthly premiums and are subject to an annual deductible 
the part a and b programs are referred to as original medicare 
since the s  medicare beneficiaries have had the option to receive their medicare benefits through private health plans  mainly health maintenance organizations hmos  as an alternative to original medicare 
the balanced budget act of named medicare managed care program medicare choice and in it was renamed as ma under the medicare modernization act mma 
in geographic areas where a managed care organization has contracted with cms pursuant to the ma program  medicare beneficiaries may choose to receive benefits from a ma organization under medicare part c 

table of contents part c under the ma program  private plans provide benefits to enrollees that are at least comparable to those offered under original medicare and can include prescription drug coverage 
part c benefits are provided through hmos  preferred provider organizations ppos and private fee for service pffs plans 
ma plans may charge beneficiaries monthly premiums and other copayments for medicare covered services or for certain extra benefits 
part d under part d  which was established in by the medicare modernization act mma  prescription drug benefits are offered by ma plans 
effective january   stand alone pdp plans could also be offered to individuals eligible for benefits under part a and or enrolled in part b 
plans can include varying degrees of out of pocket costs for premiums  deductibles and coinsurance 
depending on medical coverage type  a beneficiary has various options for accessing drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can either join a stand alone pdp or forgo part d drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in ma ccps can join a plan with part d coverage  select a stand alone pdp or forgo part d coverage 
dually eligible beneficiaries  and certain beneficiaries who qualify for the low income subsidy lis but do not enroll themselves in a pdp  are automatically assigned to a plan by cms 
these assignments are made amongst those pdps which submitted bids below the applicable regional benchmarks for standard plans 
in  projected medicare spending was billion  with more than for medicare advantage 
according to a january report by the department of health and human services hhs  the number of medicare beneficiaries is projected to grow at approximately annually as a result of the aging of the us population 
consequently  medicare spending  including premiums to medicare advantage plans  is expected to grow significantly as baby boomers retire 
in fact  according to the cbo  total medicare spending is projected to double to approximately trillion in due to growth in medicare beneficiaries and sustained increases in health care costs 
in  the majority of the million people on medicare were in the traditional medicare program  with enrolled in a ma plan 
since  the number of beneficiaries enrolled in private plans has more than doubled from million to million in ma enrollment rates vary by state  ranging from in minnesota to less than in alaska  and vary within states by county 
medicaid medicaid was established to provide medical assistance to low income and disabled persons 
it is state operated and implemented  although it is funded and regulated by both the state and federal governments 
within broad federal guidelines  each state may define its own package of covered medical services  resulting in considerable variation in the types of services covered and the amount of care provided across states 
our medicaid segment includes plans for beneficiaries of temporary assistance for needy families tanf  supplemental security income ssi  aged blind and disabled abd and other state based programs that are not part of the medicaid program  such as chip  family health plus fhp and managed long term care mltc programs 
tanf generally provides assistance to low income families with children  abd and ssi generally provide assistance to low income aged  blind or disabled individuals 
chip and fhp programs provide assistance to qualifying families who are not eligible for medicaid because their income exceeds the applicable income thresholds 
the mltc program is designed to help people with chronic illnesses or who have disabilities and need health and long term care services  such as home care or adult day care  to enable them to stay in their homes and communities as long as possible 
cms estimates total medicaid spending in at approximately billion  increasing to billion in approximately of medicaid funding comes from the federal government  with the remainder coming from state governments 
due to the medicaid expansion provisions under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the acts passed in march as discussed below  it is projected that medicaid expenditures will increase an additional trillion through  with the federal government paying approximately of these costs 
medicaid continues to be one of the fastest growing and largest components of states budgets 
according to a report by the national association of state budget officers in december  medicaid spending represented approximately on average of a state budget  and state spending for medicaid grew an estimated in  as the portion of federal government funds declined 

table of contents macroeconomic conditions in recent years have  and are expected to continue to  put pressure on state budgets as the medicaid eligible population increases  creating more need and competing for funding with other state priorities 
as medicaid consumes more and more of the states limited dollars  states must either increase their tax revenues or reduce their total costs 
since states are limited in their ability to increase their tax revenues  states often look to reduce costs by reducing funds allotted for medicaid or finding ways to control rising medicaid costs  which may include reducing premium rates or imposing further restrictions on beneficiary eligibility 
we believe that the most effective way to control rising medicaid costs is through managed care 
states have traditionally provided medicaid benefits using a fee for service system 
however  states are now more frequently implementing a managed care delivery system for medicaid benefits 
in a managed care delivery system  people get most or all of their medicaid services from an organization under contract with the state 
according to the kaiser family foundation  in all states except alaska  new hampshire and wyoming have implemented comprehensive managed care programs 
however  new hampshire is currently in the process of implementing a statewide managed care program 
approximately two thirds of all medicaid beneficiaries are in some form of a managed care arrangement  either on a voluntary or mandatory basis 
with the passage of health care reform legislation as discussed below  states will expand coverage under the medicaid program to an estimated million people in  which will increase to million in  according to the congressional budget office 
expansion of medicaid is likely to increase the number of people enrolled in and the amount of spending for managed care 
accordingly  the opportunity for growth in managed care may be significant 
dual eligibles those qualifying for both medicare and medicaid are defined as dual eligibles 
for dual eligibles  if a service is covered by medicare and medicaid  medicare is the primary payer 
medicaid pays for services above and beyond what medicare covers  which is often referred to as wrap around coverage 
medicaid may also cover some beneficiary cost sharing associated with particular medicare services 
for medicaid benefits that are not covered by medicare  such as certain long term care services  medicaid covers the cost of these benefits unless there is another liable third party payer 
medicaid is generally the payer of last resort 
the medicare and medicaid services that dual eligibles receive do not blend seamlessly with one another 
the programs often have different eligibility requirements or scope of coverage for the same or similar services 
fragmentation can result in providers lacking information about the full range of services someone receives which could compromise health care decision making  beneficiary confusion  cost inefficiencies in medicare and medicaid  and poorer quality of care and health care outcomes for the beneficiary 
there are approximately million dual eligibles according to cms  and federal and state governments spend approximately billion annually on the dual eligible population and according to cms  they make up of medicaid enrollees but incur of its expenses 
presently  only of dual eligibles are covered by private health plans 
it is imperative to enhance care options for dual eligibles as the numbers are expected to shoot up with an aging population and increased life expectancy among americans with disabilities 
as such  dual eligibles have become an immediate target for spending reductions and quality improvements in care 
the acts created a federal medicare medicaid coordination office to serve dual eligibles 
this medicare medicaid coordination office has initiated a series of state demonstration projects intended to provide better coordination and integration of care between medicare and medicaid on a capitated or fee for service basis  which is required to produce cost savings duals alignment demonstration program 
as of january  three states have executed memorandums of agreement with cms to participate in the program  a key step in demonstration implementation  and eighteen states are still negotiating with cms on their demonstration parameters 
cms has issued guidance that no programs will begin before april  and the target enrollment will be limited to to million beneficiaries 
exact implementation times vary by state 
cms has issued guidance indicating that dual eligible beneficiaries participating in the states duals alignment demonstration programs cannot be forced to remain in a duals alignment plan and will be allowed to switch between plans on a monthly basis 
however  enrollment in a ma plan is limited to the federally designated annual enrollment period or in the event of a special election period unless the individual seeks to enroll in a plan that has obtained a score of on medicare quality performance system star ratings 
none of our health plans have yet achieved stars 
for this reason  dual eligible beneficiaries subject to a dual alignment demonstration programs will only be able to elect to remain in or join a wellcare plan during the annual enrollment period or special election periods 
the guidance promulgated by cms requires a cost savings to both medicare and medicaid 
to the extent that the assumed savings are deemed unrealistic  these programs could limit the number of states in which we choose to provide services 
if the rates are deemed sufficient to support the provision of high quality care  we may choose to bid for participation in these programs 

table of contents in addition  certain states programs have not permitted us to participate  since those states require plans to be licensed as a medicaid provider or restrict participation to fee for service programs 
for those states that have a duals eligible demonstration program in which we do not participate  the membership in our ma and pdp plans in those states would be reduced 
per cms guidance  part d auto assignments to another pdp will be limited to january   and january   for and demonstration states  respectively 
general economic and political environment impacting our business the us health care economy currently comprises approximately of the us gross domestic product  according to cms 
we expect overall spending on health care in the us to continue to rise due to inflation  medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement  regulatory requirements  demographic trends in the us population and national interest in health and well being 
the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors  including macro economic conditions and enacted health care reforms  which could also impact our results of operations 
the general economic environment remains challenging  with continued high unemployment throughout and sluggish job growth 
during an economic downturn individuals lose jobs and their incomes decline  more individuals qualify and enroll in medicaid which increases program spending 
at the same time  increases in unemployment have a negative impact on state tax revenues  which could make it more difficult for states to pay their share of medicaid spending increases 
as a result  budgetary challenges at the federal and state level may continue 
we expect that the state and federal governments will continue to look for budgetary cost control savings through reductions in health care costs 
we may also experience delays in premium payments from our state customers 
the maintenance of effort requirements under the acts generally prohibit states from restricting medicaid eligibility or tightening enrollment procedures 
these provisions are due to phase out for adults in medicaid in and for children in however  the supreme court decision regarding the acts has created some uncertainty regarding whether the maintenance of effort provisions can be enforced 
in the event that they cannot  states could seek to restrict eligibility or tighten enrollment procedures 
the political environment is uncertain 
although the president signed into law the budget control act of on august   the congressional super committee failed to reach an agreement on a budget 
on january   president obama signed the american taxpayer relief act of delaying the imposition of sequestration until march as a result  in the absence of congressional intervention  approximately trillion in domestic and defense spending reductions would begin in march the budget control act of stipulates that payments to medicare providers may be reduced by no more than and exempts medicaid from the automatic spending cuts 
at this time  we cannot predict the impact of this pending legislation 
because the rate of growth of medicare expenses is outpacing the growth rate of the economy  and the trust funds are not adequately funded  congress has proposed several plans to cut or restructure medicare including raising the medicare eligibility age  moving medicare to a defined contribution model and various cuts to provider reimbursement 
medicaid is similarly situated  consuming ever greater portions of the federal budget 
as a result  several programs have been offered to modify the medicaid program including moving from a match program to a block grant  moving to a per capita system  and limiting the use of provider taxes to fund the state portion of the medicaid program 
we do not know whether these proposals will pass  or the impact the ultimate reform will have on our business 
in addition  congress has annually appropriated funds to avoid the imposition of the sustainable growth rate formula  enacted by the balanced budget act of  on physician payments under medicare 
the cut to physician payments that would result from the imposition of the sustainable growth rate formula would be approximately at the start of the cuts could have a significant impact on health care provider willingness to participate in medicare programs 
congress has not yet appropriated funds for these payments for and may fail to do so  or may delay doing so which could cause delays in receipt of payments from cms for our ma plans 

table of contents health care reform in march  the acts became law and significantly reformed various aspects of the us health insurance industry 
financing for these reforms will come in part from substantial additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers  health plans and individuals beginning in  as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare 
while regulations and interpretive guidance on some provisions of the acts have been issued to date by the hhs  the department of labor  the treasury department  and the national association of insurance commissioners naic  there are many significant provisions of the legislation that will require additional guidance and clarification in the form of regulations and interpretations in order to fully understand the impact of this legislation on our overall business  which we expect to occur over the next several years 
the acts include a number of changes to the way ma plans are operating  or will operate  such as reduced enrollment period 
medicare beneficiaries generally have a limited annual enrollment period during which they can choose to participate in a ma plan rather than receive benefits under the traditional fee for service medicare program 
after the annual enrollment period  most medicare beneficiaries are not permitted to change their medicare benefits until the following annual enrollment period 
beginning with the plan year  the acts changed the annual enrollment period  which now begins in mid october and ends in early december 
previously  open enrollment was from november to december also beginning on january   the acts began mandating that persons enrolled in ma may disenroll only during the first days of the year and only may enroll in traditional medicare fee for service rather than another ma plan 
prior law allowed a member to disenroll during the first days of the year and enroll in another ma plan 
reduced medicare premium rates 
in  ma plans received a range of of medicare fee for service costs in high cost areas to of medicare fee for service costs in low cost areas  with changes being phased in over two to six years  depending on the level of payment reduction in a county 
cms star ratings 
certain provisions in the acts tie ma premiums to the achievement of certain quality performance measures star ratings 
beginning in  ma plans with an overall star rating of three or more stars out of five became eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates 
initially  quality bonuses were limited to the few plans that achieved four or more stars as an overall rating  but cms has expanded the quality bonus to three star plans for a three year period through members of congress have challenged whether cms had the authority to expand the quality bonus 
we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter or the impact on our plans quality bonus eligibility 
plans that receive quality bonuses may have a competitive advantage in the medicare market  as they may be able to offer more attractive benefit packages to members and or achieve higher profit margins 
also  beginning with open enrollment for the plan year  part c or part d medicare plans with star ratings of less than three stars for three consecutive years will be excluded from mention in the cms medicare and you handbook  denoted as low performing plans on the cms website  and excluded from on line enrollment through the medicare plan finder website 
these actions may adversely impact these plans ability to maintain or increase membership 
in addition  in april  cms announced that part c and part d medicare plans with an overall star rating of less than three stars for three consecutive years may be terminated at cms discretion beginning on january  minimum mlrs 
beginning in  the acts require the establishment of a minimum medical loss ratio minimum mlr for ma plans  requiring them to spend not less than of premiums on medical benefits 
while hhs has issued rules clarifying the definitions and minimum mlr requirements for certain commercial health plans  it has not issued rules or guidance specific to ma plans 
the rules that have been issued impose financial and other penalties for failing to achieve the minimum mlr  including requirements to refund to cms shortfalls in amounts spent on medical benefits and termination of a plan ma contract for prolonged failure to achieve the minimum mlr 
mlr is determined by adding a plan total reimbursement for clinical services plus its total spending on quality improvement activities and dividing the total by earned premiums after subtracting specific identified taxes and other fees 
however  there can be no assurance that cms will interpret the minimum mlr requirement in the same manner for ma plans 
cms is considering imposing the minimum mlr on part d plans as well 

table of contents with respect to pdps  beginning in through  the coverage gap ie  the dollar threshold at which an individual has to pay full price for his or her medications will be gradually closed  with beneficiaries retaining a co pay 
while this change ultimately results in increased insurance coverage  such improved benefits could result in changes in member behavior with respect to drug utilization 
such actions could also impact the cost structure of our pdps 
the health reforms in the acts present both challenges and opportunities for medicaid plans 
the reforms expand the eligibility for medicaid programs 
however  state budgets continue to be strained due to economic conditions and uncertain levels of federal financing for current populations 
as a result  the effects of any potential future expansions are uncertain  making it difficult to determine whether the net impact of the acts will be positive or negative for medicaid plans 
additionally  the acts will impose certain new taxes and fees  including limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible and annual premium based assessments on the insurance industry  worth approximately billion beginning in  with increasing annual amounts thereafter 
the assessments will impact margins and will not be deductible for income tax purposes 
if plans are unable to adjust their business model to address this new tax  it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
on june   the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the provisions in the acts requiring all americans meeting certain income qualifications to purchase health insurance meeting certain standards or to pay a financial penalty the individual mandate 
the supreme court made the expansion of the states medicaid programs to individuals with incomes up to of the federal poverty line optional  however  the effect of the modification to the medicaid expansion requirements remains to be seen 
we expect some  but not all  of the states we operate in will participate in the medicaid expansion 
states also have the option to create state based exchanges 
as of january   states and the district of columbia have submitted applications or letters of intent to run part or all of their health insurance marketplaces 
seventeen states and the district of columbia have received conditional approval to operate state based exchanges  two states have received conditional approval to run partnership exchanges with the federal government 
february  is the deadline for states to notify the federal government of their intent to run a partnership exchange 
as discussed above  implementing regulations and related interpretive guidance continue to be issued on several significant provisions of the acts 
given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation  implementation and timing of these changes  which we expect to occur over the next several years  the acts could change the way we do business  potentially impacting our pricing  benefit design  product mix  geographic mix  and distribution channels 
the response of other companies to the acts and adjustments to their offerings  if any  could have a meaningful impact on the health care markets 
further  various health insurance reform proposals are also emerging at the state level 
it is reasonably possible that regulations related to the acts  as well as future legislative changes  in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows by restricting revenue  enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments  restricting our ability to expand into new markets  increasing our medical and administrative costs  lowering our medicare payment rates and or increasing our expenses associated with the non deductible federal premium based assessment and other assessments 
our product segments our operations are conducted in three business segments medicaid  ma and pdp  which correspond with the medicaid and medicare products that we offer

for purposes of our medicaid segment  we define our customer as the state and related governmental agencies that have common control over the contracts under which we operate in that particular state 
in our medicaid segment  we are operating in five of the ten largest membership states 
we are the largest medicaid health plan by revenue in florida  georgia  hawaii and kentucky 
as of january  our florida medicaid program is the only medicaid plan serving every county in the state 
the medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to effectively serve our constituencies in the communities in which we operate 
although our medicaid contracts determine to a large extent the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members  in certain markets we customize our benefits in ways that we believe make our products more attractive 
our medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and long term care 
in general  members are required to use our network to receive care  except in cases of emergencies  transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet their medical needs 
in addition  members generally must receive a referral from their primary care providers pcps in order to receive health care from a specialist  such as an orthopedic surgeon or neurologist 
members do not pay any premiums  deductibles or co payments for most of our medicaid plans 
medicaid membership the following table summarizes our medicaid segment membership by the programs we offer 
as of december  medicaid tanf chip ssi and abd and other fhp total

as of december  medicaid georgia florida kentucky all other states total all other states consists of hawaii  illinois  new york  and ohio and  in and  missouri 
we were not awarded a medicaid contract in ohio for the fiscal year  however  the state of ohio has contracted with us to provide services to ohio medicaid beneficiaries through the transition period 
we currently estimate that the transfer of our ohio medicaid members to other plans should be substantially complete in the first quarter of  but it may extend through june  medicaid segment revenues our medicaid segment generates revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans 
we receive a fixed premium per member per month pmpm pursuant to our state contracts 
our medicaid contracts with state governments are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 
we generally receive premium payments during the month in which we provide services  although we have experienced delays in receiving monthly payments from certain states 
for example  georgia has delayed making supplemental payments for obstetric deliveries and newborns to us 
in some instances  our base premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on our members acuity 
generally  the risk score is determined by the state by analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state medicaid membership 
in georgia  illinois  kentucky  new york and ohio  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments for obstetric deliveries and newborns 
in missouri  we earned supplemental payments for obstetric deliveries and newborns through the expiration of our contract on june  each contract is specific as to how and when these supplemental payments are earned and paid 
upon delivery of a newborn  the state agency is notified according to the contract terms 
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states  which may be adjusted by the states for any subsequent updates to this data

effective as of june   our missouri contract expired and was not renewed 

table of contents our florida medicaid and healthy kids contracts and illinois medicaid contract require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical services and to the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical service  we are required to refund all or a portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical expense 
we estimate the amounts due to the state as a return of premium each period based on the terms of our contract with the applicable state agency 
our current state contracts are set to expire or renew between june and august the following table sets forth the terms and expiration dates of our material medicaid contracts with the states of florida and georgia  the two states that each accounted for greater than of our consolidated premium revenues during   and  and with kentucky  a third state that accounted for greater than of our consolidated premium revenues during state line of business term of contract expiration date of current term florida medicaid staywell year term august  florida medicaid healthease year term august  georgia medicaid and chip year term with one year renewal june  kentucky medicaid year term with one year renewals july  the florida agency for health care administration ahca recently began a competitive procurement program to award contracts for medicaid managed care across the state 
these contracts may be terminated early  possibly at the end of  with the new contracts expected to begin in the first quarter of our georgia contract commenced in july and currently has one additional one year option term  exercisable by the georgia department of community health georgia dch  which potentially extends the total term until june  in addition  in georgia dch advised us that it intends to further amend our contract to add an additional two one year option terms which would potentially extend the total term until june  our original kentucky contract  not including region  commenced in july and we began offering services to members on november  the contract has an initial three year term and provides for four additional one year option terms  exercisable upon mutual agreement of the parties  which potentially extends the total term until july in october  we were awarded a contract by the commonwealth of kentucky to coordinate physical  behavioral and dental care for a total of approximately  medicaid eligible beneficiaries in medicaid managed care region  which consists of counties 
we began serving medicaid beneficiaries in region effective january  as of january   our membership for this region was estimated to be more than  medicare advantage ma we contract with cms under the medicare program to provide a comprehensive array of part c and part d benefits to medicare eligible persons 
these benefits are provided through our ma plans  which are comprised of ccps 
ccps are administered through hmos and generally require members to seek health care services and select a pcp from a network of health care providers 
in addition  we offer medicare part d coverage  which provides prescription drug benefits  as a component of our ma plans 
as of january   we offer ma plans in a total of counties across states  with over million eligible beneficiaries in these service areas 
for  we expanded our medicare advantage service area by counties in florida  georgia  illinois  kentucky  new york  and texas 
we offer duals special needs plans d snps in nearly all the counties that we serve  and approximately of our ma members are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid and are enrolled in one of our d snps 
we cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our ma plans 
for many of our plans  we provide additional benefits not covered by original medicare  such as vision  dental and hearing services 
through these enhanced benefits  out of pocket expenses incurred by our members are generally reduced  which allows our members to better manage their health care costs 

table of contents some of our ma plans require members to pay a co payment  which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided 
typically  members of our ma ccps are required to use our network of providers  except in specific cases such as emergencies  transition of care or when specialty providers are unavailable in our network to meet their medical needs 
ma ccp members may see out of network specialists if they receive referrals from their pcps and may pay incremental cost sharing 
we also offer d snps for those who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid in most of our ma markets 
we believe that our d snps are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced benefit offerings and clinical support programs 
in october  our medicare plans in connecticut  florida  hawaii  illinois  and ohio achieved a three star summary rating  while our plans in georgia  louisiana  missouri  new jersey  new york and texas received a star summary rating 
ma membership as of december   and  we had approximately   and  ma members  respectively 
membership at december  includes  california members resulting from the easy choice acquisition  which closed in november membership as of january  was approximately  a increase compared to the  members at january   and a increase from the  as of december  excluding the desert canyon and easy choice acquisitions  our january enrollment was approximately  members  an increase of from  members as of december in january our easy choice plan achieved enrollment of approximately  and through the closing of the desert canyon acquisition  we added approximately  members to our january membership  as well as our th medicare state  arizona 
at this time  we expect ma segment membership to continue to grow during the remaining months of  as we leverage our success in serving dually eligible members as well as the broader growth in the medicare population 
ma segment revenues the amount of premiums we receive for each ma member is established by contract  although the rates vary according to a combination of factors  including upper payment limits established by cms  the member geographic location  age  gender  medical history or condition  or the services rendered to the member 
ma premiums are due monthly and are recognized as revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to members 
we record adjustments to revenues based on member retroactivity 
these adjustments reflect changes in the number and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue was billed 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly 
the estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information 
changes in member retroactivity adjustment estimates had a minimal impact on premiums recorded during the periods presented 
ma premium revenue for the year ended december   and was approximately  million   million and  million  respectively 
we currently offer ma plans under separate contracts with cms for each of the states in which we offer such plans 
our ma contracts with cms all have one year terms that expire at the end of each calendar year and are renewable by the parties  our current ma contracts expire on december  medicare risk adjusted premiums cms employs a risk adjustment model to determine the premium amount it pays for each medicare member 
the risk adjustment model apportions premiums paid to all plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled and pays more for ma members with predictably higher costs 
we collect claims and encounter data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings and submit the data to cms  within prescribed deadlines  which are used to calculate the risk adjusted premiums we receive 
cms establishes the premium payments to ma plans generally at the beginning of the plan year  and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis 
the first retroactive adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year 
this initial settlement represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year 
cms then issues a final retroactive risk adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year 
we develop our estimates for risk adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience  or other data  and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each cms plan year 
our estimates are periodically updated as additional diagnosis code information is reported to cms and adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from cms or we receive notification from cms of such settlement amounts 

table of contents the data provided to cms to determine the risk score is subject to audit by cms even after the annual settlements occur 
these audits may result in the refund of premiums to cms previously received by us 
while our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund  future refunds could be significant  which would reduce our premium revenue in the year that cms determines repayment is required 
prescription drug plans pdps we have contracted with cms to serve as a plan sponsor offering stand alone medicare part d pdp plans to medicare eligible beneficiaries through our pdp segment 
the medicare part d program offers national in network prescription drug coverage with more than  pharmacies  subject to limitations in certain circumstances 
we offer pdp plans in states and the district of columbia and are focused on value conscious beneficiaries 
for  we launched a new pdp product that we believe is well positioned as a low cost enhanced plan targeted to value focused beneficiaries that actively choose their plan 
we estimate that we added over  members to this plan through the annual election period 
as of january   approximately of our membership is comprised of beneficiaries that actively chose us for their current plan 
our pdp contract with cms is renewable for successive one year terms unless cms notifies us of its decision not to renew by may of the current contract year  or we notify cms of our decision not to renew by the first monday in june of the contract year 
pdp membership as of december   and  we served approximately   and  pdp members  respectively 
membership as of december  decreased by  compared to december  as a result of our pdp bids  which resulted in the reassignment to other plans  effective january   of members who were auto assigned to us in or prior years 
based on the outcome of our pdp bids  our plans are below the benchmarks in of the centers for medicare medicaid services cms regions and within the de minimis range of the benchmark in five other cms regions 
comparatively  in  our plans were below the benchmark in five regions and within the de minimis range in other regions 
in  we are being auto assigned newly eligible members into our plans for the regions that are below the benchmark 
we are retaining our auto assigned members in the regions in which we bid within the de minimis range  however  we are not being auto assigned new members in those regions during members previously auto assigned to our pdp plans in regions for which our bids were not within the de minimus range were reassigned to other plans as of january  membership as of january  was approximately  a decrease of  or approximately from  as of december   due to the reassignment to other plans of members who were previously auto assigned to us  primarily in california  offset in part by additional auto assignments to us in other regions and an increase in the members who actively chose our pdp plans 
we expect membership for the remainder of to be relatively stable  as we focus on marketing our pdp products to those who actively choose us to offset normal attrition 
pdp segment revenues annually  we provide written bids to cms for our pdps  which reflect the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year 
substantially all of the premium for this insurance is paid by the federal government  and the balance is due from the enrolled beneficiaries 
the premium and subsidy components under part d are described below 
member premium we receive a monthly premium from members based on the plan year bid we submitted to cms 
the member premium  which is fixed for the entire plan year  is recognized over the contract period and reported as premium revenue 
cms direct premium subsidy represents monthly premiums from cms based on the plan year bid submitted by plan sponsors to cms 
the monthly payment is a risk adjusted amount per member and is based upon the member health status as determined by cms 
refer to the medicare risk adjusted premiums section under the medicare advantage ma segment discussion above for a more detailed description of risk adjusted premiums 
low income premium subsidy for qualifying lis members  cms pays for some or all of the lis member monthly premium 
the cms payment is dependent upon the member income level  which is determined by the social security administration 

table of contents low income cost sharing subsidy lics for qualifying lis members  cms reimburses plans for all or a portion of the lis member deductible  coinsurance and co payment amounts above the out of pocket threshold 
lics subsidies are paid by cms prospectively as a fixed amount pmpm  and are determined based upon the plan year bid submitted by plan sponsors to cms 
following the plan year  cms performs an annual reconciliation of the lics received by the plan sponsor to the actual amount paid by the plan sponsor 
catastrophic reinsurance subsidy cms reimburses plans for of the drug costs after a member reaches his or her out of pocket catastrophic threshold through a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy 
catastrophic reinsurance subsidies are paid by cms prospectively as a fixed amount pmpm  and are determined based upon the plan year bid submitted by plan sponsors to cms 
following the plan year  cms performs an annual reconciliation of the catastrophic reinsurance subsidy received by the plan sponsor to the actual amount paid by the plan sponsor 
coverage gap discount subsidy since  cms has provided monthly prospective payments for pharmaceutical manufacturer discounts made available to members 
the prospective discount payments are determined based upon the plan year bid submitted by plan sponsors to cms and current plan enrollment 
following the plan year  cms performs an annual reconciliation of the prospective discount payments received by the plan sponsor to the amount of actual manufacturer discounts made available to each plan sponsor enrollees under the program 
low income cost sharing  catastrophic reinsurance subsidies and coverage gap discount subsidies represent funding from cms for which we assume no risk 
the receipt of these subsidies and the payments of the actual prescription drug costs related to the low income cost sharing  catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discounts are not recognized as premium revenues or benefits expense  but are reported on a net basis as funds receivable held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets 
these receipts and payments are reported as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
after the close of the annual plan year  cms reconciles actual experience to prospective payments paid to our plans and any differences are settled between cms and our plans 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments related to the cms annual reconciliation of prior plan year low income cost sharing and catastrophic reinsurance subsidies 
we do not have a history of adjustments for the coverage gap discount subsidy as the plan year  which was the year cms implemented the coverage gap discount subsidy  has not yet been settled by cms 
cms risk corridor premiums from cms are subject to risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions 
the cms risk corridor calculation compares the target amount of prescription drug costs limited to costs under the standard coverage as defined by cms less rebates in the plan year bid to actual experience 
variances of more than above the target amount will result in cms making additional payments to plan sponsors and variances of more than below the target amount will require plan sponsors to refund to cms a portion of the premiums received 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments related to the cms settlement of the prior plan year risk corridor estimate 
pdp premium revenue for the year ended december   and was approximately million   million and million  respectively 
we offer our pdps under a single contract with cms  which has a term of one year expiring on december  and is renewable by the parties 
our operations provider networks and provider reimbursement methods we contract with a wide variety of health care providers to provide our members with access to medically necessary services 
our contracted providers deliver a variety of services to our members including primary and specialty physician care  laboratory and imaging services  inpatient  outpatient  home health and skilled facility care  medication and injectable drug therapy  ancillary services  durable medical equipment and related services  mental health and chemical dependency counseling and treatment  transportation  and dental  hearing and vision care 
the following are the types of providers in our medicaid and ma ccp contracted networks professionals such as pcps  provider groups  specialty care physicians  psychologists and licensed social workers  facilities such as hospitals with inpatient  outpatient and emergency services  skilled nursing facilities  outpatient surgical facilities and diagnostic imaging centers  ancillary providers such as laboratory providers  radiology  home health  physical therapy  speech therapy  occupational therapy  ambulance providers and transportation providers  and pharmacies  including retail pharmacies  mail order pharmacies and specialty pharmacies 

table of contents these providers are contracted through a variety of mechanisms  including agreements with individual providers  groups of providers  independent provider associations  integrated delivery systems and local and national provider chains such as hospitals  surgical centers and ancillary providers 
we also contract with other companies who provide access to contracted providers  such as pharmacy  dental  hearing  vision  transportation and mental health benefit managers 
facility  pharmacy  dental  vision and behavioral health contracts cover medically necessary services and  under some of our plans  enhanced benefits 
these contracts typically have terms of one to four years with some of the agreements automatically renewing at the end of the contract period  unless otherwise specified in writing by either party 
during the contract period  these agreements typically can be terminated without cause upon written notice by either party  but the notification period may range from to days and early termination may subject the terminating party to financial penalties 
the contract terms require providers to participate in our quality improvement and utilization review programs  which we may modify from time to time 
providers must also adhere to applicable state and federal regulations 
we periodically review the fees paid to providers and make adjustments as necessary 
generally  our contracts with providers do not allow for automatic annual increases in reimbursement levels 
among the factors generally considered in adjustments are changes to state medicaid or medicare fee schedules  competitive environment  current market conditions  anticipated utilization patterns and projected medical expenses 
some provider contracts are directly tied to state medicaid or medicare fee schedules  in which case reimbursement levels will be adjusted up or down  generally on a prospective basis  based on adjustments made by the state or cms to the appropriate fee schedule 
physicians and provider groups pcps play an important role in coordinating and managing the care of our medicaid and ma ccp members 
this coordination includes delivering preventive services as well as referring members to other providers for medically necessary services 
pcps are typically trained in internal medicine  pediatrics  family practice  general practice or  in some markets  obstetrics and gynecology 
in rare instances  a physician trained in sub specialty care will perform primary care services for a member with a chronic condition 
to help ensure quality of care  we credential and re credential all professional providers with whom we contract  including physicians  psychologists  licensed social workers  certified nurse midwives  advanced registered nurse practitioners and physician assistants who provide care under the supervision of a physician directly or through delegated arrangements 
this credentialing and re credentialing is performed in accordance with standards required by cms and consistent with the standards of the national committee for quality assurance ncqa 
we reimburse some of our pcps on a fixed fee pmpm basis 
this type of reimbursement methodology is commonly referred to as capitation 
the reimbursement covers care provided directly by the pcp as well as coordination of care from other providers as described above 
in certain markets  services such as vaccinations and laboratory or screening services delivered by the pcp may warrant reimbursement in addition to the capitation payment 
further  in some markets  pcps may also be eligible for incentive payments for achieving certain measurable levels of compliance with our clinical guidelines covering prevention and health maintenance 
these incentive payments may be paid as a periodic bonus or when the pcp submits documentation of a member receipt of services 
in limited instances  specialty care provider groups in certain regions are paid a capitation rate to provide specialty care services to members in those regions 
in all instances  we require providers to submit data reporting all direct encounters with members 
this data helps us to monitor the amount and level of medical treatment provided to our members to help improve the quality of care provided and comply with regulatory reporting requirements 
our regulators use the encounter data that we submit  as well as data submitted by other health plans  to set reimbursement rates  assign membership  assess the quality of care being provided to members and evaluate contractual and regulatory compliance 
pcps in our ma ccp products and  in limited instances  in our medicaid products  are eligible for a specialized risk arrangement to further align the interests of the pcps with ours 
pcps participating in specialized risk arrangements cover and of our ma and medicaid membership  respectively  as of december  under these arrangements  we establish a risk fund for each provider based on a percentage of premium received 
we periodically evaluate and monitor this fund on an individual or group basis to determine whether these providers are eligible for additional payments or  in the alternative  whether they should reimburse us 
payments due to us are normally carried forward and offset against future payments 

table of contents specialty care providers and  in some cases  pcps  are typically reimbursed a specified fee for the service performed  which is known as fee for service 
the specified fee is set as a percentage of the amount medicaid or medicare would pay under the applicable fee for service program 
for the year ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our payments to physicians serving our medicaid members were on a capitated basis and approximately and  respectively  were on a fee for service basis 
during the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our payments to physicians serving our medicare members in ma ccps were on a capitated basis and approximately and  respectively  were on a fee for service basis 
in addition  our recent amendments to our medicaid contracts with ahca required us to comply with federal law related to increased reimbursements to medicaid providers 
we do not currently expect to increase the reimbursement amounts until we receive an adjustment to the premium rates we receive  but if we are required to do so in the future  our medical benefits expense and medical benefits ratio would increase 
facilities our health plans arrange for hospital care primarily through contracts with selected hospitals in their service areas for coverage of medically necessary care 
these hospital contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
these contracts typically can be canceled by either party  without cause  usually upon days written notice 
in some cases a longer notice period may be required  such as where a longer period is required by regulation or the applicable government contract 
inpatient services are sometimes reimbursed as a fixed global payment for an admission based on the associated diagnosis related group  or drg  as defined by cms 
in many instances  certain services  such as implantable devices or particularly expensive admissions  are reimbursed as a percentage of hospital charges either in addition to  or in lieu of  the drg payment 
certain facilities in our networks are reimbursed on a negotiated rate paid for each day of the member admission  known as a per diem 
this payment varies based upon the intensity of services provided to the member during admission  such as intensive care  which is reimbursed at a higher rate than general medical services 
facility outpatient services are reimbursed either as a percentage of charges or based on a fixed fee schedule for the services rendered  in accordance with ambulatory payment groups or ambulatory payment categories  both as defined by cms 
outpatient services for diagnostic imaging are reimbursed on a fixed fee schedule as a percentage of the applicable medicare or medicaid fee for service schedule or a capitation payment 
in florida  ahca plans to amend the drg schedule that it uses to set rates for certain providers whose contracts are tied to medicaid effective july   which may increase or decrease our payments to these providers 
ancillary providers our typical ancillary agreements provide for coverage of medically necessary care and  in general  have terms of one year 
these contracts automatically renew for successive one year periods unless otherwise specified in writing by either party 
these contracts typically can be canceled by either party  without cause  usually upon days written notice 
in some cases a longer notice period may be required  such as where a longer period is required by regulation or the applicable government contract 
ancillary providers  who provide services such as laboratory services  home health  physical  speech and occupational therapy  and ambulance and transportation services  are reimbursed on a capitation or fee for service basis 
pharmacies pharmacy services are reimbursed based on a fixed fee for dispensing medication and a separate payment for the ingredients 
ingredients produced by multiple manufacturers are reimbursed based on a maximum allowable cost for the ingredient 
ingredients produced by a single manufacturer are reimbursed as a percentage of the average wholesale price 
in certain instances  we contract directly with the sole source manufacturer of an ingredient to receive a rebate  which may vary based upon volumes dispensed during the year 

table of contents out of network providers when our members receive services for which we are responsible from a provider outside our network  such as in the case of emergency room services from non contracted hospitals  we generally attempt to negotiate a rate with that provider 
in most cases  when a member is treated by a non contracted provider  we are obligated to pay only the amount that the provider would have received from traditional medicaid or medicare 
member recruitment our member recruitment and marketing efforts for both medicaid and medicare members are heavily regulated by state agencies and cms 
for many products  we rely on the auto assignment of members into our plans  including our pdp plan 
the auto assignment of a beneficiary into a health or prescription drug plan generally occurs when that beneficiary does not choose a plan 
the agency with responsibility for the program determines the approach by which a beneficiary becomes a member of a plan serving the program 
some programs assign members to a plan automatically based on predetermined criteria 
these criteria frequently include a plan rates  the outcome of a bidding process  quality scores or similar factors 
for example  cms auto assigns pdp members based on whether a plan bids during the annual renewal process are above or below the cms benchmark 
in most states  our medicaid health plans benefit from auto assignment of individuals who do not choose a plan but for whom participation in managed care programs is mandatory 
each state differs in its approach to auto assignment  but one or more of the following criteria is typical in auto assignment algorithms a medicaid beneficiary previous enrollment with a health plan or experience with a particular provider contracted with a health plan  enrolling family members in the same plan  a plan quality or performance status  a plan network and enrollment size  awarding all auto assignments to a plan with the lowest bid in a county or region  and equal assignment of individuals who do not choose a plan in a specified county or region 
our medicaid marketing efforts are regulated by the states in which we operate  each of which imposes different requirements for  or restrictions on  medicaid sales and marketing 
these requirements and restrictions can be revised from time to time 
several states  including our three largest medicaid states  florida  georgia and kentucky  do not permit direct sales by medicaid health plans 
we rely on member selection and auto assignment of medicaid members into our plans in those states 
our medicare marketing and sales activities are regulated by cms and the states in which we operate 
cms has oversight over all  and in some cases has imposed advance approval requirements with respect to  marketing materials used by ma plans  and our sales activities are limited to activities such as conveying information regarding benefits  describing the operations of managed care plans and providing information about eligibility requirements 
the activities of our independently licensed insurance agents are also regulated by cms 
we also employ our own sales force and contract with independent  licensed insurance agents to market our ma and pdp products 
we have continued to expand our use of independent agents whose cost is largely variable in nature and whose engagement is more conducive to the shortened medicare selling season and the elimination of the open enrollment period 
we also use direct mail  mass media and the internet to market our products 
enrollment in our pdps is impacted by the auto assignment of members  which is subject to a bid process whereby we submit to cms our estimated costs to provide services in the next fiscal year 
for example  based on the outcome of our pdp bids  our plans are below the benchmarks in of the cms regions and within the de minimis range of the benchmark in five other cms regions 
in  we are being auto assigned newly eligible members into our plans for the regions that are below the benchmark 
members previously auto assigned to our pdp plans in regions for which our bids were not within the de minimis range are being reassigned to other plans in comparatively  in  our prescription drug plans were below the benchmarks in five regions and within the de minimus ranges in other regions 
we are retaining our auto assigned members in the five regions in which we bid within the de minimis range  however  we are not being auto assigned new members in those regions during consequently  our pdp membership has declined to approximately  as of january  we expect membership for the remainder of to be relatively stable as we focus on marketing our pdp products to those who actively choose us to offset normal attrition 
enrollment into our plans is also subject to suspension or termination due to sanctions 
for example  during  cms imposed a sanction against us that prohibited us from the marketing of  and enrolling members into  all lines of our medicare business from march until the sanction was released in november of as a result of the sanction  we were also not eligible to receive auto assignment of low income subsidy  dually eligible beneficiaries into our pdps for january enrollment 

table of contents quality improvement we are focused on improving quality across all of our lines of business  which is critical to the continued growth and success of our business 
we continually seek to improve the quality of care delivered by our network providers to our members and our ability to measure the quality of care provided 
our quality improvement program provides the basis for our quality and utilization management functions and outlines ongoing processes designed to improve the delivery of quality health care services to our members  as well as to enhance compliance with regulatory and accreditation standards 
our operating expenditures for quality improvement costs increased by more than in compared to for  we expect to sustain our investment consistent with the level of premium revenues  as was the case in our quality improvement activities will continue to focus on preventive health and wellness and care management  case and disease management  health plan accreditation  provider credentialing provider education and incentives for closing care gaps  member education and outreach  information technology initiatives related to the above activities  and audits and oversight preventive health and wellness and care management we sponsor a number of initiatives aimed at the promotion of healthy lifestyles and the prevention of disease  including preventive screenings  health education programs to inform members about health care issues and healthy behaviors and health assessment counseling to inform members how to use the resources and services available to them to help reduce preventable diseases 
case and disease management some examples of our intervention programs include a prenatal case management program to help women with high risk pregnancies  a program to reduce the number of inappropriate emergency room visits  and disease management programs to decrease the need for emergency room visits and hospitalizations 
accreditation several of our health plans are accredited by nationally recognized independent organizations that have been established to measure health plans commitment to effective management and accountability 
our florida hmos are currently accredited by urac and our georgia  hawaii and missouri hmos are accredited by ncqa 
in january  our florida medicaid and medicare health plans were awarded ncqa accreditation 
we remain dedicated to our long term target of attaining accreditation for all of our health plans and currently expect ncqa accreditation in a number of states before the end of provider credentialing we credential physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals in our participating provider networks using quality criteria which meet or exceed the standards of external accreditation or state regulatory agencies  or both 
typically  most health care professionals are re credentialed every three years  depending on applicable state laws 
provider education and incentives for closing care gaps as part of our quality improvement program  at times we have implemented changes to our reimbursement methods to reward those providers who encourage preventive care  such as well child check ups  prenatal care and or who adopt evidence based guidelines for members with chronic conditions 
additionally  several of our markets have provider incentives for closing care gaps inherent to the health care system 
this initiative has resulted in increased member experiences to drive improvement in the quality of care 

table of contents member education and outreach regarding our members  we are focused on improving access to a high performing network of providers  including pcps  specialists and ancillary providers  and ensuring that members see the appropriate providers  based on clinical condition 
if members experience difficulties in maintaining their appointments with providers  we will proactively outreach to members telephonically or arrange for home visits to assess and close care gaps 
we are focused on enhancing our members experience by improving service and reducing complaint levels through improved grievance and appeals processes and member satisfaction surveys 
in june  we successfully launched new customer service tools to support more intensive management of care gaps  which has resulted in over  member education sessions  many involving real time appointment setting with our providers 
information technology initiatives we understand the importance of information technology in improving the level of service that we can provide to our members 
accordingly  we continue to invest in our information technology infrastructure and capabilities including tools that support our focus on improving our ability in providing members with quality health care 
we have specialized systems to support our quality improvement activities and to gather information from our systems to identify opportunities to improve care and track the outcomes of the services provided to achieve those improvements  such as evaluating the effects of particular preventive measures 
oversight and audits internally  our quality improvement programs benefit from executive oversight and project management processes 
additionally  each of our health plans has a quality improvement committee comprised of senior members of management  medical directors and other key associates of ours 
each of these committees report directly to the applicable health plan boards of directors  which have ultimate oversight responsibility for the quality of care rendered to our members 
the quality improvement committees also have a number of subcommittees that are charged with monitoring certain aspects of care and service  such as health care utilization  pharmacy services and provider credentialing and re credentialing 
several of these subcommittees include physicians as committee members 
our board of directors recognizes the importance of delivering quality care and providing access to that care for our members and has established the health care quality and access committee of the board 
the primary purpose of this committee is to assist the board by reviewing  and providing general oversight of  our health care quality and access strategy  including our policies and procedures governing health care quality and access for our members 
this input helps provide overall direction and guidance to our quality improvement committees 
we conduct routine site audits of select providers and medical record audits to ensure the effectiveness of our quality improvement programs 
technology the accurate and timely capture  processing and analysis of critical data are cornerstones for providing managed care services 
focusing on data is also essential to operating our business in a cost effective manner 
data processing and data driven decision making are key components of both administrative efficiency and medical cost management 
we use our information system for premium billing  claims processing  utilization management  reporting  medical cost trending  planning and analysis 
the system also supports member and provider service functions  including enrollment  member eligibility verification  primary care and specialist physician roster access  claims status inquiries  and referrals and authorizations 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the ability of our existing operations to support our current and future business needs and to maintain our compliance requirements 
this evaluation may result in enhancing or replacing current systems and or processes which could result in our incurring substantial costs to improve our operations and services 
we recently completed an upgrade of our core operating systems 
this new technology will enable further progress on our work to improve service and productivity  and positions us to comply with future regulatory requirements such as the implementation of icd by october this upgrade will also support our health care quality and access initiatives 

table of contents we have a disaster recovery plan that addresses how we recover business functionality within stated timelines 
we have a cold site and business recovery site agreement with a nationally recognized  third party vendor to provide for the restoration of our general support systems at a remote processing center 
we perform disaster recovery testing at least annually for those business applications that we consider critical 
reinsurance we bear underwriting and reserving risks associated with our hmo and insurance subsidiaries 
we retain certain of these risks through our wholly owned  captive insurance subsidiary 
we reduce exposure to large catastrophic losses by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of what we retain internally with highly rated  unaffiliated insurance companies 
however  we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses  so we continually monitor the financial condition of these companies to ensure that they are maintaining these high ratings 
outsourcing arrangements our care and service delivery model is designed to optimize our use of our personnel versus third parties based on an evaluation of factors  including cost  compliance  quality and procurement success 
as a result  we have contracted with a number of vendors to provide significant operational support including  but not limited to  pharmacy benefit management and behavioral health services for our members as well as certain enrollment  billing  call center  benefit administration  claims processing functions  sales and marketing and certain aspects of utilization management 
our dependence on these vendors makes our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to perform adequately under our contracts with them 
in addition  where a vendor provides services that we are required to provide under a contract with a government customer  we are responsible for such performance and will be held accountable by our government customers for any failure of performance by our vendors 
we evaluate the competency and solvency of our third party vendors prior to execution of contracts and include service level guarantees in our contracts where appropriate 
additionally  we perform ongoing vendor oversight activities to identify any performance or other issues related to our vendors 
centralized management services we provide centralized management services to each of our health plans from our tampa  florida headquarters and call centers  with the current exceptions of our recently acquired california and south carolina hmo subsidiaries 
we expect to integrate and begin providing services directly to these subsidiaries once we receive regulatory approval to do so  which we expect to occur before the end of these services include information technology  product development and administration  finance  human resources  accounting  legal  public relations  marketing  insurance  purchasing  risk management  internal audit  actuarial  underwriting  claims processing and customer service and are provided by a non regulated affiliated administrator 
we have managed behavioral health care for the kentucky medicaid program since its inception in november and plan to begin insourcing behavioral health services for most of our health plans in employees we refer to our employees as associates 
as of december   we had approximately  full time associates 
our associates are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe we have good relations with our associates 
our competition competitive environment we operate in a highly competitive environment to manage the cost and quality of services that are delivered to government health care program beneficiaries 
we currently compete in this environment by offering medicare and medicaid health plans in which we accept all or nearly all of the financial risk for management of beneficiary care under these programs 
we typically must be awarded a contract by the government agency with responsibility for a program in order to offer our services in a particular location 
some government programs choose to limit the number of plans that may offer services to beneficiaries  while other agencies allow an unlimited number of plans to serve a program  subject to each plan meeting certain contract requirements 
when the number of plans participating in a program is limited  an agency generally employs a bidding process to select the participating plans 

table of contents as a result  the number of companies with which we compete varies significantly depending on the geographic market  business segment and line of business 
for example  in florida  the medicaid program currently does not specifically restrict the number of participating plans 
in contrast  the georgia department of community health  which operates the georgia families and peachcare programs  awarded contracts to only three plans 
we compete with one or two other plans in each of the six regions in georgia 
likewise  in our medicare business  the number of competitors varies significantly by geography 
in most cases  there are numerous other medicare plans and other competitors 
we believe a number of our competitors in both medicare and medicaid have strengths that may match or exceed our own with respect to one or more of the criteria on which we compete with them 
further  some of our competitors may be better positioned than us to withstand rate compression 
competitive factors program participation regardless of whether the number of health plans serving a program is limited  we believe government agencies determine program participation based on several criteria 
these criteria generally include the terms of the bids as well as the breadth and depth of a plan provider network  quality and utilization management processes  responsiveness to member complaints and grievances  timeliness and accuracy of claims payment  financial resources  historical contractual and regulatory compliance  quality scores  references and accreditation  and other factors 
competitive factors network providers in addition  we compete with other health plans to contract with hospitals  physicians  pharmacies and other providers for inclusion in our networks that serve government program beneficiaries 
we believe providers select plans in which they participate based on several criteria 
these criteria generally include reimbursement rates  timeliness and accuracy of claims payment  potential to deliver new patient volume and or retain existing patients  effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints  and other factors 
obtaining members the agency with responsibility for a particular program determines the approach by which a beneficiary becomes a member of one of the plans serving the program 
generally  government programs either assign members to a plan automatically or they permit participating plans to market to potential members  though some programs employ both approaches 
for more information about auto assignment and how we obtain our members generally  see the member recruitment discussion above 
medicaid competitors in the medicaid managed care market  our principal competitors for state contracts  members and providers include the following types of organizations mcos managed care organizations mcos that  like us  receive state funding to provide medicaid benefits to members 
many of these competitors operate in a single or small number of geographic locations 
there are a few multi state medicaid only organizations that are able to leverage their infrastructure over a larger membership base 
competitors include private and public companies  which can be either for profit or non profit organizations  with varying degrees of focus on serving medicaid populations 
medicaid fee for service traditional medicaid offered directly by the states or a modified version whereby the state administers a primary care case management model 
psns a provider service network psn is a network of providers that is established and operated by a health care provider or group of affiliated health care providers 
a psn operates as either a fee for service ffs health plan or as a prepaid health plan that  like us  receives a capitated premium to provide medicaid benefits to members 
a psn that operates as a ffs health plan is not at risk for medical benefit costs 
ffs psns are at risk for of their administrative cost allocation if their total costs exceed the estimated at risk capitation amount 

table of contents medicare competitors in the medicare market  our primary competitors for contracts  members and providers include the following types of competitors original fee for service medicare original medicare is available nationally and is a fee for service plan managed by the federal government 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can go to any doctor  supplier  hospital or other facility that accepts medicare and is accepting new medicare patients 
medicare advantage and prescription drug plans ma and stand alone part d plans are offered by national  regional and local mcos and insurance companies that serve medicare beneficiaries 
in addition  prescription drug plans are being offered by or co branded with retail drug store chains or other retail store chains  which may be able to offer lower priced plans and achieve benefits from integration with their pharmacy benefit management operations 
employer sponsored coverage employers and unions may subsidize medicare benefits for their retirees in their commercial group 
the group sponsor solicits proposals from ma plans and may select an hmo  ppo and or pdp to provide these benefits 
medicare supplements original medicare pays for many  but not all  health care services and supplies 
a medicare supplement policy  commonly called medigap  is private health insurance designed to supplement original medicare by covering the cost of items such as co payments  coinsurance and deductibles 
some medicare supplements cover additional benefits for an additional cost 
medicare supplement plans can be used to cover costs not otherwise covered by original medicare  but cannot be used to supplement ma plans 
regulation impacting our business our health care operations are highly regulated by both state and federal government agencies 
regulation of managed care products and health care services is an ever evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws  statutes  regulations and rules occur frequently 
these changes may include a requirement to provide health care services not contemplated in our current contracted premium rate or to pay providers at a state mandated fee schedule without a commensurate adjustment to the premium rate 
for further information  see the provider networks and reimbursement methods discussion above 
in addition  government agencies may impose taxes  fees or other assessments upon us and other managed care companies at any time 
our contracts with various state government agencies and cms to provide managed health care services include provisions regarding provider network adequacy  maintenance of quality measures  accurate submission of encounter and health care cost information  maintaining standards of call center performance and other requirements specific to government and program regulations 
we must also have adequate financial resources to protect the state  our providers and our members against the risk of our insolvency 
our failure to comply with these requirements may result in the assessment of penalties  fines and liquidated damages 
for further information on data provided to cms that is subject to audit  refer to the medicare risk adjusted premiums discussion above 
government enforcement authorities have become increasingly active in recent years in their review and scrutiny of various sectors of the health care industry  including health insurers and managed care organizations 
we routinely respond to subpoenas and requests for information from these entities and  more generally  we endeavor to cooperate fully with all government agencies that regulate our business 
product compliance medicaid programs medicaid is state operated and implemented  although it is funded by both the state and federal governments 
within broad guidelines established by the federal government  each state 
table of contents establishes its own eligibility standards  determines the type  amount  duration and scope of services  sets the rate of payment for services  and administers its own program 
we have entered into contracts with medicaid agencies in each state in which we operate medicaid plans 
some of the states in which we operate award contracts to applicants that can demonstrate that they meet the state minimum requirements 
other states engage in a competitive bidding process for all or certain programs 
in either case  we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the respective agency that we are able to meet certain operational and financial requirements 
for example we must measure provider access and availability in terms of the time needed for a member to reach the doctor office  our quality improvement programs must emphasize member education and outreach and include measures designed to promote utilization of preventive services  we must have linkages with schools  city or county health departments and other community based providers of health care in order to demonstrate our ability to coordinate all of the sources from which our members may receive care  we must have the capability to meet the needs of disabled members  our providers and member service representatives must be able to communicate with members who do not speak english or who are hearing impaired  and our member handbook  newsletters and other communications must be written at the prescribed reading level and must be available in languages other than english 
once awarded  our medicaid program contracts generally have terms of one to three years 
most of these contracts provide for renewal upon mutual agreement of the parties  or at the option of the government agency  and both parties have certain early termination rights 
in addition to the operating requirements listed above  state contract requirements and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth detailed provisions relating to subcontractors  marketing  safeguarding of member information  fraud and abuse reporting and grievance procedures 
our medicaid plans are subject to periodic financial and informational reporting and comprehensive quality assurance evaluations 
we regularly submit periodic utilization reports  operations reports and other information to the appropriate medicaid program regulatory agencies 
our compliance with the provisions of our contracts is subject to monitoring or examination by state regulators 
certain contracts require us to be subject to quality assurance evaluations by a third party organization 
medicare programs medicare is a federal health insurance program that provides eligible persons age and over and some disabled persons a variety of hospital  medical insurance and prescription drug benefits 
medicare beneficiaries have the option to enroll in various types of ma plans  such as ma ccp plans  ppo benefit plans or ma pffs plans  in areas where such plans are offered 
under ma  managed care plans contract with cms to provide benefits that are comparable to  or that may be more attractive to medicare beneficiaries than  original medicare in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member that varies based on the county in which a member resides  the demographics of the member and the member health condition 
currently  we only offer ccp plans under the ma program 
along with other part d plans  both pdps and medicare advantage prescription drug plans ma pds  we bid on providing part d benefits in june of each year 
based on the bids submitted  cms establishes a national benchmark 
cms pays the part d plans a percentage of the benchmark on a pmpm basis with the remaining portion of the premium being paid by the medicare member 
members whose income falls below of the federal poverty level qualify for the federal lis  through which the federal government helps pay the member part d premium and certain other cost sharing expenses 
each of our ma health plans and our pdp plan contract with cms are on a calendar year basis 
cms requires that each plan meet certain regulatory requirements including  as applicable provisions related to enrollment and disenrollment  restrictions on marketing activities  benefits or formulary requirements  quality assessment  fraud  waste and abuse monitoring  maintaining relationships with health care providers  and responding to appeals and grievances 

table of contents our ma and pdp plans perform ongoing monitoring of our compliance with the cms requirements  including functions performed by vendors 
from time to time  cms conducts examinations of our compliance with the provisions of our ma and pdp contracts 
licensing and solvency regulation our operations are conducted primarily through hmo and insurance subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are licensed by the insurance department in the state in which they operate  except our new york hmo subsidiary  which is licensed as a prepaid health services plan by the new york state department of health  and our california hmo  which is licensed by the california department of managed health care 
the subsidiaries are subject to the rules  regulation and oversight of the applicable state agencies in the areas of licensing and solvency 
state insurance laws and regulations prescribe accounting practices for determining statutory net income and capital and surplus 
each of our regulated subsidiaries is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed 
these reports describe each of our regulated subsidiaries capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and business operations 
from time to time  any of our regulated subsidiaries may be selected to undergo periodic audits  examinations or reviews by the applicable state agency of our operational and financial assertions 
our regulated subsidiaries generally must obtain approval from  or provide notice to  the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds  entering into other arrangements with related parties  acquisitions or similar transactions involving an hmo or insurance company  or any change in control 
for purposes of these laws  in general  control commonly is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity  directly or indirectly  owns  controls or holds the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity 
each of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation 
the minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  a percentage of certain liabilities  a statutory minimum  risk based capital rbc requirements or other financial ratios 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the naic  and have been adopted by most states 
as of december   our hmo operations in all states except california  new york  and florida were subject to rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state 
the rbc formula  based on asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which represents the amount of capital required to support the regulated entity business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of of the required acl or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
our subsidiaries operating in texas and ohio are required to maintain statutory capital at rbc levels equal to and  respectively  of the applicable acl 
failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state 
at december   our hmo and insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum capital requirements 
the combined statutory capital and surplus of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  compared to the required surplus of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum capital requirements changes over time 
for instance  rbc requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate 
these subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers 
for example  the state of new york adopted regulations that increase the reserve requirement annually until in addition  regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituencies 
moreover  if we expand our plan offerings in a state or pursue new business opportunities  we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash 
dividend restrictions vary by state  but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to restrictions relating to statutory capital  surplus and net income for the previous year 
some states require prior approval of all dividends  regardless of amount 
states may disapprove any dividend that  together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior months  exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income 
for the years ended december   and  we received million  million and million respectively  in cash dividends from our regulated subsidiaries 

table of contents also  we may only invest in the types of investments allowed by a particular state in order to qualify as admitted assets in that state and we are required by certain states to deposit or pledge assets that are considered restricted assets 
at december  and  our restricted assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents  money market accounts  certificates of deposits  and us government securities 
hipaa and state privacy laws the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the regulations adopted under hipaa are intended to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims and related transactions 
all health plans  including ours  are subject to hipaa 
hipaa generally requires health plans to protect the privacy and security of patient health information through the implementation of appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards  and establish the capability to receive and transmit electronically certain administrative health care transactions  such as claims payments  in a standardized format 
we are also subject to state laws that provide for greater privacy of individuals health information  such laws are not preempted by hipaa 
fraud and abuse laws federal and state enforcement authorities have prioritized the investigation and prosecution of health care fraud  waste and abuse 
fraud  waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of operating activities  including kickbacks or other inducements for referral of members or for the coverage of products such as prescription drugs by a plan  billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider  improper marketing and violation of patient privacy rights 
companies involved in public health care programs such as medicaid and medicare are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud  waste and abuse  and are often the subject of fraud  waste and abuse investigations and audits 
the regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public sector programs are complex and subject to change 
although we have structured our compliance program with care in an effort to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements  our policies and procedures are continuously under review and subject to updates and our training and education programs are always evolving 
we have invested significant resources to enhance our compliance efforts  and we expect to continue to do so 
federal and state laws and regulations governing submission of information and claims to agencies we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that apply to the submission of information and claims to various agencies 
for example  the federal false claims act provides  in part  that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person or entity who it believes has knowingly presented  or caused to be presented  a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government  or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved 
the federal government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti kickback statute may be considered a violation of the federal false claims act 
violations of the false claims act are punishable by treble damages and penalties of up to a specified dollar amount per false claim 
in addition  a special provision under the false claims act allows a private person for example  a whistleblower such as a disgruntled former associate  competitor or member to bring an action under the false claims act on behalf of the government alleging that an entity has defrauded the federal government and permits the private person to share in any settlement of  or judgment entered in  the lawsuit 
a number of states  including states in which we operate  have adopted false claims acts that are similar to the federal false claims act

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors  together with all of the other information included in this report  in evaluating our company and our business 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  and the value of our stock could decline 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
as such  you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
risks related to our business failure to maintain satisfactory quality scores could negatively impact our premium rates  subject us to penalties  limit or reduce our membership  impede our ability to compete for new business in existing or new markets or result in the termination of our contracts 
quality scores are used by certain agencies to establish premium rates or  in the case of cms  to pay bonuses to better performing ma plans that enable those plans to offer improved member health benefits to attract more members 
in certain states  plans that do not meet the quality measures can be required to refund premiums previously received  or pay penalties  or the plan may be subject to enrollment limitations  including suspension of auto assignment of members  or termination of the contract 
if the state determines that we have failed to meet the contractual requirements  these contracts may be subject to termination  or other remedies  at the discretion of the state 
we are unable to predict what actions the state may take  if any  when assessing our contractual performance 
in addition  lower quality scores compared to our competitors may result in us losing potential new business in new markets  obtaining regulatory approval for acquisitions and expansions or dissuading potential members from choosing our plan in markets in which we already compete 
as a result  lower quality scores compared to our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth 
medicaid premiums are fixed by contract and do not permit us to increase our premiums during the contract term  therefore  if we are unable to estimate and manage medical benefits expense effectively  our profitability likely will be reduced or we could cease to be profitable 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage our costs related to the provision of health care services 
relatively small changes in the ratio of our expenses related to health care services to the premiums we receive  or medical benefits ratio  can create significant changes in our financial results 
factors that may cause medical benefits expense to exceed our estimates include the addition of new members  whether by acquisition  new enrollment  program startup or expansion  whose risk profiles are uncertain or unknown and for whom initiatives to manage their care take longer than expected  
table of contents an increase in the cost of health care services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  whether as a result of inflation or otherwise  higher than expected utilization of health care services  periodic renegotiation of hospital  physician and other provider contracts  the occurrence of catastrophes  major epidemics  terrorism or bio terrorism  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  and new mandated benefits  increased mandated provider reimbursement rates or other changes in health care laws  regulations and or practices 
if our medical benefits expense increases and we are unable to manage these medical costs effectively in the future  our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 
most of our revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries  determined by the types of members in our plans 
these payments are fixed by contract and we are obligated during the contract period  which is generally one to four years  to provide or arrange for the provision of health care services as established by states and the federal government 
the payments are generally set based on an estimation of the medical costs using actuarial methods based on historical data 
actual experience  however  could differ from the assumptions used in the premium setting process  which could result in premiums being insufficient to cover our medical benefits expense 
if our medical benefits expense exceeds our estimates or our regulators actuarial pricing assumptions  and we are unable to adjust the premiums we receive under our current contracts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in particular  our medicaid plan in kentucky has operated at an mbr of greater than for each period since we began our operations there in november while we have begun to improve care coordination to manage costs  and we have received revenue enhancements from kentucky  we cannot be assured that these efforts will be successful or sufficient 
in addition  one of the other managed care plans in kentucky announced its intention to terminate its contract with the commonwealth effective july  and some of those members may be transferred to our plan  however  the plan may decide to remain in kentucky or we may not be allocated any of these members even if the other plan does exit kentucky 
the addition of these members may adversely impact our mbr in kentucky 
in addition  there are sometimes wide variations in the established rates per member in both our medicaid and medicare lines of business 
for instance  the rates we receive for an ssi member are generally significantly higher than for a non ssi member who is otherwise similarly situated 
as the composition of our membership base changes as the result of programmatic  competitive  regulatory  benefit design  economic or other changes  there is a corresponding change to our premium revenue  costs and margins  which may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations 
our membership is concentrated in certain geographic areas in the us  and unfavorable changes in health care or other benefit costs or reimbursement rates or increased competition in those geographic areas could therefore have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 
some provider contracts are directly tied to state medicaid fee schedules  which the state or cms may adjust without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us 
for example  in florida the state is considering implementing changes to the medicaid fee schedules  which may increase our reimbursement rates to providers 
we have experienced such adjustments in the states in which we operate 
unless such adjustments are mitigated by an increase in premiums  or if this were to occur in any more of the states in which we operate  our profitability will be negatively impacted 
also  in some rural areas  it is difficult to maintain a provider network sufficient to meet regulatory requirements 
in situations where we have a deficiency in our provider network  regulators require us to allow members to obtain care from out of network providers at no additional cost  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage expenses 
in some states  with respect to certain services  the amount that the health plan must pay to out of network providers for services provided to our members is defined by law or regulation  but in certain instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms 
out of network providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the health plan 
the uncertainty of the amount to pay and the possibility of subsequent adjustments of the payment could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
although we maintain reinsurance to protect us against certain severe or catastrophic medical claims  we cannot assure you that such reinsurance coverage currently is or will be adequate or available to us in the future or that the cost of such reinsurance will not limit our ability to obtain it 

table of contents difficulties in successfully executing acquisitions  expansions and other significant transactions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
as part of our prudent  profitable growth strategy  we identify potential acquisition targets  bid and negotiate acquisition terms  work with regulators to receive regulatory approval for the acquisition and once the transaction is closed  we must integrate the acquisition into our operations 
in  we completed two acquisitions  easy choice in california and desert canyon in arizona  and in january  we completed our acquisition of unitedhealth group incorporated south carolina medicaid plan 
our acquisition of aetna  inc missouri medicaid plan is pending closing 
once an attractive acquisition target is identified  we may not be successful in bidding against competitors 
other potential acquirers may have greater financial resources or different profitability criteria than we have 
depending on the transaction size  we may not be able to obtain appropriate financing  especially in light of the volatility in the capital markets over the past several years 
even if we are successful in bidding against competitors  we may not be able to obtain the regulatory approval from federal and state agencies required to complete the acquisition 
we may not be able to comply with the regulatory requirements necessary for approval of the acquisition or state regulators may give preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities  competitors with higher quality scores or not for profit entities 
in addition  when making award determinations and regulatory approvals of acquisitions and expansions  regulators frequently consider the plan historical regulatory compliance  litigation and reputation and we are required to disclose material investigations and litigation  including in some cases investigations and litigation that occurred in the past 
as a result of the previous federal and state investigations  stockholder and derivative litigation  restatement during of our previously issued financial statements and related matters  and the criminal trial of certain of our former executives and employees that is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of  we have been  and may continue to be  the subject of negative publicity 
as a result  continuing negative publicity and other negative perceptions regarding these matters may adversely affect our ability to grow 
once acquired  we may have difficulties integrating the businesses within our existing operations  due to associates who must become familiar with our operations and corporate culture  acquired provider networks which operate on different terms than our existing networks and whose contracts may need to be renegotiated  existing members who decide to switch to another health care plan  disparate administrative and information technology systems  and difficulties implementing our operations strategy to operate the acquired businesses profitably 
furthermore  we may incur significant transaction expenses in connection with a potential acquisition or expansion opportunity which may not be successful 
these expenses could impact our selling  general and administrative expense ratio 
if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy or integrate acquired businesses  our future growth may suffer and our profitability may decrease 
our rate of expansion into other geographic areas may also be inhibited by the time and costs associated with obtaining the necessary license to operate in the new area or the expansion of our licensed service area  if necessary  lower quality scores compared to our competitors  participation in fewer lines of business compared to our competitors  our inability to develop a network of physicians  hospitals and other health care providers that meets our requirements and those of government regulators  cms or state contract provisions regarding quality measures  such as cms star ratings  competition  which increases the cost of recruiting members  the cost of providing health care services in those areas  demographics and population density  and applicable state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus 

table of contents in any program start up  acquisition  expansion  or re bid  the implementation of the contract as designed may be affected by factors beyond our control 
these include political considerations  network development  contract appeals  incumbency  participation in other lines of business  membership assignment allocation of members who do not self select  errors in the bidding process  difficulties experienced by other private vendors involved in the implementation  such as enrollment brokers  and noncompliance with contractual requirements with which we do not yet have experience and similar risks 
our business  particularly plans for expansion or increased membership levels  could be negatively impacted by these delays or changes 
growth could also place a significant strain on our management and on other resources and we are likely to incur additional costs if we enter states or counties where we do not currently operate 
our ability to manage our growth may depend on our ability to retain and strengthen our management team  attract  train and retain skilled associates  and implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  due to the initial substantial costs related to acquisitions and expansions  such growth could materially adversely affect our short term profitability and liquidity 
future changes in health care law present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
future changes in existing health care laws or regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations could materially reduce our revenue and or profitability by  among other things imposing additional license  registration and or capital requirements  increasing our administrative and other costs  requiring us to change our operating structure  increasing mandated benefits  further limiting our ability to engage in intra company transactions with our affiliates and subsidiaries  restricting our revenue and enrollment growth  requiring us to restructure our relationships with providers  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
requirements relating to increased plan information disclosure  expedited appeals and grievance procedures  third party review of certain medical decisions  health plan liability  access to specialists  clean claim payment timing claims for which no additional information is needed  mandated increases in provider reimbursement rates  physician collective bargaining rights and confidentiality of medical records either have been enacted or are under consideration 
changes in state law  regulations and rules also may materially adversely affect our profitability 
we believe the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the acts will bring about significant changes to the american health care system 
these measures are intended to expand the number of united states residents covered by health insurance and make other coverage  delivery  and payment changes to the current health care system 
the costs of implementing the acts will be financed  in part  from substantial additional fees and taxes on us and other health insurers  health plans and individuals  as well as reductions in certain levels of payments to us and other health plans under medicare 
the acts will also impose certain new taxes and fees  including limitations on the amount of compensation that is tax deductible and annual assessments on all health insurers  worth approximately billion beginning in  which will increase in subsequent years 
the imposition of this assessment will impact our operating margins 
in addition  in states in which we compete with not for profit medicaid health plans  we may need to reduce margins in order to assure price competitiveness 
as a result  this new tax may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
on june   the us supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate contained in the acts and modified the medicaid expansion provisions to make the expansion optional for states 
some states have decided not to participate in the medicaid expansion  and more states may choose not to participate in the future 
congress may also withhold the funding necessary to fully implement the acts or may attempt to replace the legislation with amended provisions or repeal it altogether 
given the breadth of possible changes and the uncertainties of interpretation  implementation  and timing of these changes  which we expect to occur over the next several years  the acts could change the way we do business  potentially impacting our pricing  benefit design  product mix  geographic mix  and distribution channels 

table of contents regulations related to the acts  as well as future legislative changes  in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows by restricting revenue  enrollment and premium growth in certain products and market segments  restricting our ability to expand into new markets  increasing our medical and administrative costs  lowering our medicare payment rates and or increasing our expenses associated with the non deductible federal premium tax and other assessments 
in addition  the response of other companies to the acts and adjustments to their offerings  if any  could have a meaningful impact in the health care markets 
the acts include a number of changes that could impact the way ma plans will operate  such as reduced medicare premium rates 
in  ma plans received a range of of medicare fee for service costs in high cost areas to of medicare fee for service costs in low cost areas  with changes being phased in over two to six years  depending on the level of payment reduction in a county 
cms star ratings 
certain provisions in the acts tie ma premiums to the achievement of star ratings 
beginning in  ma plans with an overall star rating of three or more stars out of five are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates 
initially  quality bonuses were limited to the few plans that achieved a four or higher overall star rating  but cms expanded the quality bonus to plans with a three overall star rating for a three year period through members of congress have challenged whether cms had the authority to expand the quality bonus 
we cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter or the impact on our plans quality bonus eligibility 
plans that receive quality bonuses may have a competitive advantage in the medicare market  as they may be able to offer more attractive benefit packages to members and or achieve higher profit margins 
also  beginning with open enrollment for the plan year  part c or part d medicare plans with star ratings of less than three stars for three consecutive years will be excluded from mention in the cms medicare and you handbook  denoted as low performing plans on the cms website  and excluded from on line enrollment through the medicare plan finder website 
these actions may adversely impact these plans ability to maintain or increase membership 
in addition  in april  cms announced that part c and part d medicare plans with an overall star rating of less than three stars for three consecutive years may be terminated at cms discretion beginning on january  some of our plans have less than three stars 
while we are continuing efforts to improve our star ratings and other quality measures for and beyond  there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain or improve our star ratings in future years 
minimum mlrs 
beginning in  the acts require ma plans to spend not less than of premiums on medical benefits 
while the department of health and human services hhs has issued rules clarifying the definitions and minimum medical loss ratio mlr requirements for certain commercial health plans  it has not issued rules or guidance specific to medicare plans 
the rules that have been issued impose financial and other penalties for failing to achieve the minimum mlr ratio  including requirements to refund to cms shortfalls in amounts spent on medical benefits and termination of a plan ma contract for prolonged failure to achieve the minimum mlr ratio 
cms is considering imposing the minimum mlr on part d plans as well 
from through  the coverage gap ie  the dollar threshold at which an individual has to pay full price for his or her medications under part d will be gradually closed  with beneficiaries retaining a co pay 
while this change ultimately results in increased insurance coverage  such improved benefits could result in changes in member behavior with respect to drug utilization 
such actions could also impact the cost structure of our part d programs 
the health reforms in the acts present both challenges and opportunities for our medicaid business 
the reforms allow states to expand eligibility for medicaid programs 
however  state budgets continue to be strained due to economic conditions and uncertain levels of federal financing for current populations 
as a result  the effects of any potential future expansions are uncertain  making it difficult to determine whether the net impact of the acts will be positive or negative for our medicaid business 
we encounter significant competition for program participation  members  network providers  key personnel and sales personnel and our failure to compete successfully may limit our ability to increase or maintain membership in the markets we serve  or have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
some of our competitors are more established in the insurance and health care industries  with larger market share  greater financial resources and better quality scores than we have in some markets 
we operate in  or may attempt to acquire business in  programs or markets in which premiums are determined on the basis of a competitive bidding process 
in these programs or markets  funding levels established by bidders with significantly different cost structures  target profitability margins or aggressive bidding strategies could negatively impact our ability to maintain or acquire profitable business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents regulatory reform or other initiatives may bring additional competitors into our markets 
regulators may prefer companies that operate in multiple lines of business when we bid on new business or renewals of existing business  in which we may not operate 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network  benefits provided and quality of service 
we may not be able to develop innovative products and services which are attractive to members 
we cannot be sure that we will continue to remain competitive  nor can we be sure that we will be able to successfully acquire members for our products and services at current levels of profitability 
in addition  we compete with other health plans to contract with hospitals  physicians  pharmacies and other providers for inclusion in our networks that serve government program beneficiaries 
we believe providers select plans in which they participate based on several criteria including reimbursement rates  timeliness and accuracy of claims payment  potential to deliver new patient volume and or retain existing patients  effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints and other factors 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully attract or retain providers to maintain a competitive network in the geographic areas we serve 
we may not be able to attract or retain qualified management  clinical and commercial personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel in the managed care and health care industry and other businesses 
if we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our objectives  our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy 
in particular  if we lose any members of our senior management team  we may not be able to find suitable replacements  and our business may be harmed as a result 
our ma plans are sold primarily through our sales personnel  who frequently work with independent brokers  consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business 
the independent brokers  consultants and agents generally are not dedicated to us exclusively and may frequently also recommend and or market health care benefits products of our competitors  and we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance 
our sales could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain sales personnel and third party brokers  consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support  training and education to this sales network regarding our product portfolio  which is complex  or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 
to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve  our ability to retain or increase members and providers  maintain or increase our revenue growth  and control medical cost trends  and or our pricing flexibility  may be adversely affected 
failure to compete successfully in the markets we serve may have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and results of operations 
for a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate  see part i  item business competition 
risk adjustment payment systems make our revenue and results of operations more difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
most of our government customers employ risk adjustment models to determine the premium amount they pay for each member 
this model pays more for members with predictably higher costs according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled 
premium payments are generally established at fixed intervals according to the contract terms  and then adjusted on a retroactive basis 
we reassess the estimates of the risk adjustment settlements each reporting period and any resulting adjustments are made to premium revenue 
as a result of the variability of certain factors that determine estimates for risk adjusted premiums  including plan risk scores  the actual amount of retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates 
consequently  our estimate of our plans risk scores for any period  and any resulting change in our accrual of premium revenues related thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the data provided to our government customers to determine the risk score are subject to audit by them even after the annual settlements occur 
these audits may result in the refund of premiums to the government customer previously received by us  which could be significant and would reduce our premium revenue in the year that repayment is required 
government customers have performed and continue to perform audits of selected plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each member 
it is likely that a payment adjustment will occur as a result of these audits  and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 

table of contents our medicaid operations are concentrated in a limited number of states 
loss of a material contract  reduced premium rates  or delayed payment of earned premiums may adversely impact our business 
our concentration of operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue  profitability or cash flow to change suddenly and unexpectedly as a result of significant premium rate reductions or payment delays  a loss of a material contract  legislative actions  changes in medicaid eligibility methodologies  catastrophic claims  an epidemic or pandemic  or an unexpected increase in utilization  general economic conditions and similar factors in those states 
our inability to continue to operate in any of these states  or a significant change in the nature of our existing operations  could adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs  including medicare advantage  medicaid  chip and abd 
we provide those health care services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate 
for the year ended december   three of our medicaid customers each accounted for greater than of our consolidated premium revenue  net of premium taxes 
these customers florida  georgia and kentucky accounted for contracts that have terms of between one and three years with varying expiration dates 
our florida medicaid contracts expire in august  however we currently anticipate that these will be terminated early  possibly as early as the end of the florida agency that operates the state medicaid program recently began a competitive procurement process to award contracts for medicaid managed care across the state 
the agency expects to award contracts under the competitive procurement in we currently intend to submit a proposal under this process but we cannot assure you our proposal will be successful 
our contracts with other states are generally intended to run for one to three years and in some cases may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so 
our current state contracts are set to expire or renew between june and december when our state contracts expire  they may be opened for bidding by competing health care providers 
there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended 
further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 
our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies 
if any of our contracts are terminated  not renewed  renewed on less favorable terms  or not renewed on a timely basis  or if an increased number of competitors were awarded contracts in these states  our business will suffer  and our financial position  results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 
state governments generally are experiencing tight budgetary conditions within their medicaid programs due to difficult macroeconomic conditions and increases in the medicaid eligible population 
we anticipate this will require government agencies with which we contract to find funding alternatives  which may result in reductions in funding 
if any state in which we operate were to decrease premiums paid to us  or pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends  it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
economic conditions affecting state governments and agencies could also result in delays in receiving premium payments 
if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to pay health benefit costs  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
a significant percentage of our medicaid plan enrollment results from mandatory enrollment in medicaid managed care plans 
states may mandate that certain types of medicaid beneficiaries enroll in medicaid managed care through cms approved plan amendments or  for certain groups  through federal waivers or demonstrations 
waivers and programs under demonstrations are generally approved for two to five year periods  and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies and the waiver request is approved or renewed by cms 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state in which we operate does not mandate managed care enrollment in its state plan or does not renew an existing managed care waiver  our membership would likely decrease  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we derive a significant portion of our medicare revenue from our pdp operations  for which we submit annual bids for participation 
the results of our bids could materially impact our revenue and profits 
a significant portion of our pdp membership is obtained from the auto assignment of beneficiaries in cms designated regions where our pdp premium bids are below benchmarks of other plans bids 
in general  our premium bids are based on assumptions regarding pdp membership  utilization  drug costs  drug rebates and other factors for each region 
if our future part d premium bids are not below the cms benchmarks  we risk losing pdp members who were previously assigned to us and we may not have additional pdp members auto assigned to us  which would materially reduce our revenue and profits 

table of contents based on the outcome of our pdp bids  our plans are below the benchmarks in of the cms regions and within the de minimis range of the benchmark in five other cms regions 
in  newly eligible members are being auto assigned into our plans for the regions that are below the benchmark 
we will retain our auto assigned members in the five regions in which we bid within the de minimis range  however  we will not be auto assigned new members in those regions during as of january   the beneficiaries who had previously been auto assigned to our plans in the regions in which our bids were neither below the benchmark nor within the de minimis range were reassigned to other plans 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and risk of litigation  and any violation by us of the terms of our contracts  applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate 
the laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than stockholders 
the government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them 
these laws and regulations  along with the terms of our government contracts  regulate how we do business  what services we offer  and how we interact with our members  providers and the public 
any violation by us of applicable laws or regulations could reduce our revenues and profitability  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face a significant risk of class action lawsuits and other litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses 
the following are examples of types of potential litigation and regulatory investigations we face claims by government agencies relating to compliance with laws and regulations  claims relating to sales practices  claims relating to the methodologies for calculating premiums  claims relating to the denial or delay of health care benefit payments  claims relating to claims payments and procedures  claims relating to provider marketing  anti kickback claims  medical malpractice or negligence actions based on our medical necessity decisions or brought against us on the theory that we are liable for our providers alleged malpractice or negligence  allegations of anti competitive and unfair business activities  provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts  allegations of discrimination  allegations of breaches of duties  claims relating to inadequate or incorrect disclosure or accounting in our public filings  allegations of agent misconduct  claims related to deceptive trade practices  and claims relating to audits and contract performance 
as we contract with various governmental agencies to provide managed health care services  we are subject to various reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit  investigation or adverse result from litigation could result in forfeiture or recoupment of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of significant civil or criminal penalties  fines or other sanctions on us and or our key associates  reduction or limitation of our membership  loss of our right to participate in government sponsored programs  including medicaid and medicare  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in marketing our products and services  inability to obtain approval for future service or geographic expansion  and suspension or loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer  hmo or third party administrator or to otherwise provide a service 
in particular  because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies  we are subject to various laws commonly referred to as fraud and abuse laws  including the federal false claims act  which permit agencies and enforcement authorities to institute suit against us for violations and  in some cases  to seek treble damages  penalties and assessments 
many states  including states where we currently operate  have enacted parallel legislation 
liability under such federal and state statutes and regulations may arise if we know  or it is found that we should have known  that information we provide to form the basis for a claim for government payment is false or fraudulent 

table of contents some courts have permitted false claims act suits to proceed if the claimant was out of compliance with program requirements 
liability for such matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
qui tam actions under federal and state law can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government 
qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years  causing greater numbers of health care companies to defend false claim actions  pay fines or be excluded from medicare  medicaid or other state or federal health care programs as a result of investigations arising out of such actions 
for example  in october  the civil division of the united states department of justice the civil division informed us that as part of its civil inquiry  it was investigating four qui tam complaints filed by relators against us under the whistleblower provisions of the false claims act 
we also learned from a docket search that a former employee filed a qui tam action in state court for leon county  florida against several defendants  including us and one of our subsidiaries 
with respect to these actions  in april  we announced that we reached a settlement with the civil division  the civil division of the united states attorney office for the middle district of florida  and the civil division of the united states attorney office for the district of connecticut 
however  other qui tam actions may have been filed against us of which we are presently unaware  or other qui tam actions may be filed against us in the future 
under delaware law  our charter and bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party  we have an obligation to indemnify  or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify  certain of our current and former directors  officers and associates with respect to current and future investigations and litigation 
in connection with some of these pending matters  including the upcoming criminal trial of certain of our former executives and associates  we are required to  or we have otherwise agreed to  advance  and have advanced  significant legal fees and related expenses and expect to continue to do so while these matters are pending 
we have exhausted our insurance for these matters  and expenses incurred by us for these matters will not be further reimbursed 
we currently maintain insurance in the amount of million which provides coverage for our independent directors and officers hired after january  for certain potential matters to the extent they occur after october we cannot provide any assurances that pending claims  or claims yet to arise  will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies  that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims 
we are currently undergoing standard periodic audits by several state agencies and cms to verify compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
for additional risks associated with these audits  see risk adjustment payment systems make our revenue and results of operations more difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations above 
in addition  there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care and other insurance products and the payments they receive 
these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling those companies products 
for example  cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products 
these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and or changes to industry practices  which could adversely affect our ability to market our products 
we rely on a number of third parties  and failure of any one of the third parties to perform in accordance with our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our care and service delivery model is designed to optimize our use of our personnel versus third parties based on an evaluation of factors  including cost  compliance  quality and procurement success 
as a result  we have contracted with a number of third parties to provide significant operational support including  but not limited to  pharmacy benefit management and behavioral health services for our members as well as certain enrollment  billing  call center  benefit administration  claims processing functions  sales and marketing and certain aspects of utilization management 
we have limited ability to control the performance of these third parties 
if a third party provides services that we are required to provide under a contract with a government client  we are responsible for such performance and will be held accountable by the government client for any failure of performance by our vendors 
significant failure by a third party to perform in accordance with the terms of our contracts could subject us to fines or other sanctions or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  upon termination of a third party contract  we may encounter difficulties in replacing the third party on favorable terms  or in assuming those responsibilities ourselves  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  quality scores and results of operations 
further  we rely on state operated systems and sub contractors to qualify and assign eligible members into our health plan 
ineffectiveness of these state operations and sub contractors can have a material adverse effect on our enrollment 

table of contents we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by our government clients to collect premiums  and any inaccuracies in those lists may cause states to recoup premium payments from us  which could materially reduce our revenues and results of operations 
premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by our government clients 
a state will require us to reimburse it for premiums that we received from the state based on an eligibility list that it later discovers contains individuals who were not eligible for any government sponsored program  have been enrolled twice in the same program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program 
our review of remittance files may not identify all member eligibility errors and could result in repayment of premiums in years subsequent to the year in which the revenue was recorded 
in addition to recoupment of premiums previously paid  we also face the risk that a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment 
our results of operations would be reduced as a result of the state failure to pay us for related payments we made to providers and were unable to recoup 
we have established a reserve in anticipation of recoupment by the states of previously paid premiums that we believe to be erroneous  but ultimately our reserve may not be sufficient to cover the amount  if any  of recoupments 
if the amount of any recoupment exceeds our reserves  our revenues could be materially reduced and it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our encounter data may be inaccurate or incomplete  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and ability to bid for  and continue to participate in  certain programs 
to the extent that our encounter data is inaccurate or incomplete  we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect or correct this data and have been and could be exposed to operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance 
the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and  in part  to set premium rates 
in some instances  our government clients have established retroactive requirements for the encounter data we must submit 
there also may be periods of time in which we are unable to meet existing requirements 
in either case  it may be prohibitively expensive or impossible for us to collect or reconstruct this historical data 
we have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data  due to difficulties with providers and third party vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format  and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions 
as states increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulties could affect the premium rates we receive and how membership is assigned to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and our ability to bid for  and continue to participate in  certain programs 
if we are unable to have access to sufficient capital  whether as a result of difficulties finding acceptable public or private financing  restrictions due to our existing credit agreement  restrictions on dividend payments from our subsidiaries  or higher statutory capital levels  we may be unable to grow or maintain our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
our business strategy has been defined by three primary initiatives  one of which includes our ability to enter new markets by pursuing attractive growth opportunities for our existing product lines 
we may need to access the debt or equity markets and receive dividends from our subsidiaries to fund these growth activities 
our ability to enter new markets may be hindered in situations where we need to access the public markets and financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
our ability to obtain favorable financing may be unfavorable in terms such as high rates of interest  restrictive covenants and other restrictions and could impede our ability to profitably operate our business and increase the expected rate of return we require to enter new markets  making such efforts unfeasible 
our credit agreement has restrictions on our ability to secure additional capital 
our substantial indebtedness and restrictive covenants limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  and expose us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under our senior credit facilities is variable 

table of contents our debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes  including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures  which could impede our growth 
if our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to comply with the financial covenants in the credit agreement or to service our debt obligations  we may be forced to sell assets  seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt which could harm our long term business prospects 
our credit agreement contains various restrictions and covenants that restrict our financial and operating flexibility  including our ability to grow our business or declare dividends without lender approval 
if we fail to pay any of our indebtedness when due  or if we breach any of the other covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness  one or more events of default may be triggered 
if we are unable to obtain a waiver  these events of default could permit our creditors to declare all amounts owed to be immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay indebtedness owed to our secured creditors  they could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness 
in addition  in most states  we are required to seek the prior approval of state regulatory authorities to transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries in excess of specified amounts or  in some states  any amount 
extraordinary dividends require approval by state regulators prior to declaration 
if our state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and or distributions by certain of our regulated subsidiaries to us or our non regulated subsidiaries  our liquidity  unregulated cash flows  business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
our licensed hmo and insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital and maintenance of certain financial ratios  as defined by each state 
one or more of these states may raise the statutory capital level from time to time  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity 
our subsidiaries also may be required to maintain higher levels of statutory capital due to the adoption of risk based capital requirements by other states in which we operate 
our subsidiaries are subject to their state regulators general oversight powers 
regardless of whether a state adopts the risk based capital requirements  the state regulators can require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of amounts required under the applicable state laws if they determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interests of our members and other constituents 
for example  if premium rates are inadequate  reduced profits or losses in our regulated subsidiaries may cause regulators to increase the amount of capital required 
any additional capital contribution made to one or more of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  cash flows and growth potential 
in addition  increases of statutory capital requirements could cause us to withdraw from certain programs or markets where it becomes economically difficult to continue operating profitably 
if we commit a material breach of our corporate integrity agreement  we may be excluded from certain programs  resulting in the revocation or termination of contracts and or licenses potentially having a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
on april   we entered into a corporate integrity agreement the corporate integrity agreement with the officer of inspector general of the department of health and human services oig hhs 
the corporate integrity agreement has a term of five years and concludes the previously disclosed matters relating to us under review by oig hhs 
the corporate integrity agreement requires us to maintain various ethics and compliance programs that were designed to help ensure our ongoing compliance with federal health care program requirements 
the terms of the corporate integrity agreement include certain organizational structure requirements  internal monitoring requirements  compliance training  screening processes for new employees  requirements for reporting to oig hhs  and the engagement of an independent review organization to review and prepare written reports regarding  among other things  our reporting practices and bid submissions to federal health care programs 
if we fail to comply with the terms of the corporate integrity agreement we may be required to pay certain monetary penalties 
furthermore  if we commit a material breach of the corporate integrity agreement  oig hhs may exclude us from participating in federal health care programs 
any such exclusion would result in the revocation or termination of contracts and or licenses and potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we are exposed to fluctuations in the securities and debt markets  which could impact our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio represents a significant portion of wellcare assets and is subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks 
market fluctuations in the securities and credit markets could impact the value or liquidity of our investment portfolio and adversely impact interest income 
as a result  we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity which may materially impact our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
risks related to ownership of our stock we are subject to laws  government regulations and agreements that may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of our company  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions favorable to stockholders 
our operating subsidiaries are subject to state laws that require prior regulatory approval for any change of control of an hmo or insurance company 
for purposes of these laws  in most states control is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity acquires the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity  subject to certain exceptions 
these laws may discourage acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company  including through transactions  and in particular through unsolicited transactions  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into transactions that some or all of our stockholders find favorable 
in addition  certain of our settlements require us to make additional payments upon the occurrence of certain change of control events 
these include a million payment in the event that we are acquired or otherwise experience a change in control within three years of march   the effective date of the final settlement agreement with the civil division of the united states department of justice the civil division  the civil division of the united states attorney office for the middle district of florida the usao  and the civil division of the united states attorney office for the district of connecticut to settle their pending inquiries 
additionally  if  within three years following the may  execution of the settlement agreement with the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated securities class action against us  we are acquired or otherwise experience a change in control at a share price of or more  we will be required to pay to the class an additional million 
our stock price and trading volume may be volatile and future sales of our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
from time to time  the price and trading volume of our common stock  as well as the stock of other companies in the health care industry  may experience periods of significant volatility 
company specific issues and developments generally in the health care industry including the regulatory environment and the capital markets and the economy in general may cause this volatility 
our stock price and trading volume may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including variations in our operating results  changes in the market expectations about our future operating results  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning our company or the health care industry generally  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  news reports relating to trends in our markets  changes or proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business  acquisitions and financings by us or others in our industry  and sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors and executive officers or principal stockholders  or the perception that such sales could occur 
we may issue equity securities in the future  including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s filed with the sec under which we may offer from time to time an indeterminate amount of any combination of debt securities  common and preferred stock and warrants 
the registration statement allows us to seek additional financing  subject to the sec rules and regulations relating to eligibility to use form s additional equity financing will be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 

table of contents sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities  including sales of shares in connection with any future acquisitions  could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
these sales may have a harmful effect on prevailing market prices for our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at a time and price favorable to us 
holders of shares of our common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle them to purchase a pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and  therefore  such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation provides that we have authority to issue  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock 
risks related to information technology if we are unable to maintain effective and secure management information systems and applications  successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs we could experience operational disruptions and other materially adverse consequences to our business and results of operations 
our business depends on effective and secure information systems  applications and operations 
the information gathered  processed and stored by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  marketing and sales and membership tracking  billing  claims processing  medical management  medical care cost and utilization trending  financial and management accounting  reporting  and planning and analysis 
these systems also support our customer service functions  provider and member administrative functions and support tracking and extensive analysis of medical expenses and outcome data 
these systems remain subject to unexpected interruptions resulting from occurrences such as hardware failures or increased demand 
there can be no assurance that such interruptions will not occur in the future  and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
moreover  operating and other issues can lead to data problems that affect the performance of important functions  including  but not limited to  claims payment  customer service and financial reporting 
there can also be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems  developing new systems to support our operations and improving service levels will not be delayed or that system issues will not arise in the future 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our systems  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  such as the inability to pay claims or to make claims payments on a timely basis  loss of members  difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
additionally  events outside our control  including terrorism or acts of nature such as hurricanes  earthquakes  or fires  could significantly impair our information systems  applications and critical business functions 
to help ensure continued operations in the event that our primary operations are rendered inoperable  we have a disaster recovery plan to recover critical business functionality within stated timelines 
our plan may not operate effectively during an actual disaster and our operations and critical business functions could be disrupted  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our costs to comply with laws governing the transmission  security and privacy of health information could be significant  and any disruptions or security breaches in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and client data stored in our information systems 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems  or those of our providers or regulators  which could disrupt our operations  or make our systems inaccessible to our providers or regulators 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
failure to keep our computer networks  information technology systems  computers and programs and our members and customers sensitive information secure from attack  damage or unauthorized access  whether as a result of our action or inaction or that of one of our business associates or other vendors  could adversely affect our reputation  membership and revenues and also expose us to mandatory disclosure to the media  contract termination  litigation including class action litigation  and other enforcement proceedings  material fines  penalties and or remediation costs  and compensatory  special  punitive and statutory damages  consent orders  adverse actions against our licenses to do business and or injunctive relief  any of which could adversely affect our business  cash flows  operating results or financial condition 

table of contents our measures to prevent security breaches may not be successful 
as we expand our business  including through acquisitions and organic growth  increase the amount of information we make available to members and consumers on mobile devices and expand our use of social media  our exposure to these data security and related cybersecurity risks  including the risk of undetected attacks  damage or unauthorized access  increases  and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases 
under the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  civil penalties for hipaa violations by covered entities are increased up to an annual maximum of million for uncorrected violations based on willful neglect 
in addition  imposition of these penalties is now more likely because arra strengthens enforcement 
for example  commencing february  hhs was required to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance 
investigations of violations that indicate willful neglect  for which penalties became mandatory in february  are statutorily required 
in addition  state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of hipaa privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents 
initially monies collected will be transferred to a division of hhs for further enforcement and  within three years  a methodology will be adopted for distributing a percentage of those monies to affected individuals to fund enforcement and provide incentive for individuals to report violations 
in addition  arra requires us to notify affected individuals  hhs  and in some cases the media when unsecured personal health information is subject to a security breach 
arra also contains a number of provisions that provide incentives for states to initiate certain programs related to health care and health care technology  such as electronic health records 
while provisions such as these do not apply to us directly  states wishing to apply for grants under arra  or otherwise participating in such programs  may impose new health care technology requirements on us through our contracts with state medicaid agencies 
we are unable to predict what such requirements may entail or what their effect on our business may be 
we will continue to assess our compliance obligations as regulations under arra are promulgated and more guidance becomes available from hhs and other federal agencies 
the new privacy and security requirements  however  may require substantial operational and systems changes  associate education and resources and there is no guarantee that we will be able to implement them adequately or prior to their effective date 
given hipaa complexity and the anticipated new regulations  which may be subject to changing and perhaps conflicting interpretation  our ongoing ability to comply with all of the hipaa requirements is uncertain  which may expose us to the criminal and increased civil penalties provided under arra and may require us to incur significant costs in order to seek to comply with its requirements 
our business could be adversely impacted by adoption of the new icd standardized coding set for diagnoses 
hhs has released rules pursuant to hipaa which mandate the use of standard formats in electronic health care transactions 
hhs also has published rules requiring the use of standardized code sets and unique identifiers for providers 
by october  the federal government will require that health care organizations  including health insurers  upgrade to updated and expanded standardized code sets used for documenting health conditions 
these new standardized code sets  known as icd  will require substantial investments from health care organizations  including us 
while use of the icd code sets will require significant administrative changes  we believe that the cost of compliance with these regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
however  these changes may result in errors and otherwise negatively impact our service levels  and we may experience complications related to supporting customers that are not fully compliant with the revised requirements as of the applicable compliance date 
furthermore  if physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for services provided as a result of the new coding set  we may not be reimbursed  or adequately reimbursed  for such services

item legal proceedings 
united states department of health and human services in april  we entered into a corporate integrity agreement the corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of health and human services oig hhs 
the corporate integrity agreement has a term of five years 
the corporate integrity agreement requires various ethics and compliance programs designed to help ensure our ongoing compliance with federal health care program requirements 
the terms of the corporate integrity agreement include certain organizational structure requirements  internal monitoring requirements  compliance training  screening processes for new employees  reporting requirements to oig hhs  and the engagement of an independent review organization to review and prepare written reports regarding  among other things  our reporting practices and bid submissions to federal health care programs 
if we fail to comply with the terms of the corporate integrity agreement we may be required to pay certain monetary penalties 
furthermore  if we commit a material breach of the corporate integrity agreement  oig hhs may exclude us from participating in federal health care programs 
any such exclusion would result in the revocation or termination of contracts and or licenses and potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
other lawsuits and claims separate and apart from the legal matter described above  we are also involved in other legal actions in the normal course of our business  including  without limitation  wage and hour claims  tax disputes  vendor disputes and provider disputes regarding payment of claims 
some of these actions seek monetary damages  including claims for liquidated or punitive damages  which are not covered by insurance 
we accrue for contingent liabilities related to these matters if a loss is deemed probable and is estimable 
the actual outcome of these matters may differ materially from our current estimates and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows

overview introduction we are a leading provider of managed care services to government sponsored health care programs  focusing on medicaid and medicare 
headquartered in tampa  florida  we offer a variety of health plans for families  children  and the aged  blind and disabled  as well as prescription drug plans 
as of december   we served approximately million members nationwide 
we believe that our broad range of experience and exclusive government focus allows us to effectively serve our members  partner with our providers and government clients  and efficiently manage our ongoing operations 
summary of consolidated financial results summarized below are the key highlights for the year ended december  for additional information  see the remaining sections of this item  which discuss both consolidated and segment results in more detail 
membership increased  reflecting growth in our medicaid segment  particularly in kentucky  which commenced in november and had a subsequent open enrollment in november  and in florida  as well as growth in our medicare ma membership due to service area expansion 
premiums increased  mainly reflecting the membership growth in our medicaid and medicare advantage ma markets  as well as rate increases in certain of our medicaid markets 
net income decreased  primarily due to a decrease in our medicaid segment results  and higher selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense mainly due to our spending on quality and growth initiatives  partially offset by improved results in our ma and pdp segments 
results also benefited from a pre tax gain of million on the repurchase of subordinated notes 
the decrease in medicaid segment results was due mainly to a lower amount of net favorable development of prior period medical benefits payable in than occurred in  and a relatively higher mbr in the kentucky medicaid program due to transition of members into managed care 
key developments and accomplishments our strategic priorities for included improving health care quality and access for our members  ensuring a competitive cost position and delivering prudent and profitable growth 
see part i  item business for a complete definition of our strategic priorities 
presented below are key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our strategic business priorities that occurred or impacted our financial condition and results of operations during and for  prior to the filing of this form k 
in january  we entered into an agreement to acquire aetna medicaid business in missouri  which as of december  served more than  mo healthnet medicaid program members in counties across the state 
in january  we acquired unitedhealthcare group incorporated medicaid business in south carolina  which participates in south carolina healthy connections choices program across of the state counties 
in december  we acquired from humana  inc certain assets of arcadian health plan  inc desert canyon community care desert canyon ma plans 
approximately  desert canyon plan members in mohave and yavapai counties became members of our arizona ma health plan on january  
table of contents in november  we acquired easy choice health plan  inc of california easy choice 
as of january  easy choice served approximately  ma plan members 
easy choice increased its service area to california counties  including the san diego area and five counties in northern california 
easy choice began offering ma chronic condition special needs plans in five of the counties in its service area in january in october  we added approximately  new florida healthy kids members as a result of our expansion from serving counties to of florida counties 
we now offer florida healthy kids services in more counties than any other participating plan 
as of january  we expanded our service area in the florida medicaid program to include all counties across florida 
we also received a premium rate increase of approximately to retroactive to september  in october  we were awarded a contract by the commonwealth of kentucky to coordinate physical  behavioral and dental care for a total of approximately  medicaid eligible beneficiaries in medicaid managed care region  which consists of counties 
we began serving medicaid beneficiaries in region effective january  as of january   our membership for this region was estimated to be more than  the commonwealth of kentucky recently completed its initiative to ensure that the medicaid managed care program is structured to deliver quality  cost effective care to members on a sustainable  long term basis 
as a result  effective january   the company received an approximate premium rate increase for the kentucky medicaid program 
the commonwealth also has accelerated to july   our rate increase previously scheduled for october  these rate increases apply to all medicaid geographic regions of the commonwealth  other than region in october  we were awarded a contract by the hawaii department of human services to case manage  authorize and facilitate the delivery of behavioral health services to medicaid eligible adults who have serious mental illnesses  and who are participants in the state quest expanded access qexa health program on a statewide basis 
we anticipate services beginning in march we continue to expand the geographic footprint of our ma plans and offer d snps for those who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid in most of the ma markets we serve 
this expansion is consistent with our focus on the lower income demographic of the market and our ability over time to serve both the medicaid and medicare related coverage of these members 
ma membership as of january  was approximately  an increase from  as of december  for the plan year  we now offer plans in a total of counties 
in october  our ma plans in florida  hawaii  illinois  connecticut and ohio each achieved a three star summary rating while our ma plans in georgia  louisiana  missouri  new york  texas and new jersey each received a star summary rating 
we are focused on improving quality across all of our lines of business 
for example  as a result of our quality improvement measures  we met the performance requirements of our contracts under the new york medicaid and fhp programs  which were subject to termination if our quality scores did not improve  and we will continue to provide services to members of our new york health plans  and we now have quality health plan status 
our quality accomplishments include the new health plan accreditation of our hawaii plan 
in january  our florida medicaid and medicare health plans were awarded ncqa accreditation 
we continue to target accreditation for all of our health plans  and anticipate further progress in with respect to our strategic priority of ensuring a competitive cost structure  was a year of significant progress 
our administrative expense ratio decreased basis points year over year to in compared to in 
table of contents business and financial outlook general economic  political environment and health care reform a number of states are evaluating new strategies for their medicaid programs 
given ongoing fiscal challenges  economic conditions  and the success of medicaid managed care programs over the long run  states continue to recognize the value of collaborating with managed care plans to deliver quality  cost effective health care solutions 
additionally  we believe that the acts will bring about significant changes to the american health care system 
for further discussion of the current and political environment that is affecting our business  including health care reform and its potential impact on our business  see part i  item business  general economic and political environment impacting our business 
in addition  refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discussed in part i  item a risk factors future changes in health care law present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
medicaid our florida medicaid contracts expire in august  however we currently anticipate that these will be terminated early  possibly as early as the end of the florida agency that operates the state medicaid program  ahca  recently began a competitive procurement process to award contracts for medicaid managed care across the state 
the agency has not yet announced the implementation schedule  but it expects to award contracts under the competitive procurement in we currently intend to submit a proposal under this process but we cannot assure you our proposal will be successful 
additionally in florida  ahca plans to amend the drg schedule that it uses to set rates for certain providers whose contracts are tied to medicaid effective july   which may increase or decrease our payments to these providers 
in addition  our recent amendments to our medicaid contracts with ahca required us to comply with federal law related to increased reimbursements to medicaid providers 
we do not currently expect to increase the reimbursement amounts until we receive an adjustment to the premium rates we receive  but if we are required to do so in the future  our medical benefits expense and medical benefits ratio would increase 
in  the georgia department of community health the georgia dch announced further refinements to its medicaid redesign initiatives 
at this time  the georgia dch will not conduct a re procurement of the georgia families program  which currently serves temporary assistance for needy families tanf and children health insurance program chip members  and will not begin to include aged  blind and disabled abd beneficiaries as previously planned  given what the georgia dch describes as increasing uncertainty at the federal level 
our current georgia medicaid contract provides for an additional one year renewal option exercisable by the georgia dch 
the georgia dch exercised its option to extend the term of our georgia medicaid contract until june  and the remaining renewal option potentially extends the contract through june  the georgia dch has also indicated its intent to amend our georgia medicaid contract to include two additional one year renewal options  exercisable by the georgia dch  that could potentially extend the contract term to june the georgia dch also plans to move forward with several changes to modernize the georgia families program 
these may include the promotion of a primary care medical home initiative  a move to value based purchasing  and the adoption of a common preferred drug list 
additionally  the state is looking to simplify the administrative process for providers by moving all three care management organizations operating in the state to a common platform for functions such as credentialing  and prior authorization management 
we look forward to working with the georgia dch to accomplish these initiatives 
beginning with the fourth quarter  the commonwealth of kentucky eliminated its caps on the risk adjustment of premium rates for the medicaid program 
we began serving medicaid beneficiaries in region of the commonwealth of kentucky on january  as of january   our membership for this region was estimated to be more than  region members will have the opportunity to change their health plan through the end of march 
in addition  the members assigned to us in january will be served under a day transition of care period 
as a result of our quality improvement measures  we met the performance requirements of our contracts under the new york medicaid and fhp programs  which were subject to termination if our quality scores did not improve  and we will continue to provide services to members of our new york health plans  and we now have quality health plan status 

table of contents with respect to medicaid rates  we continue to expect the environment to be challenging  given state and federal fiscal conditions 
the ultimate premium rate is based on program type  demographic mix and geographic location 
we estimate that our rates will decrease approximately in georgia retroactive to july  in florida  we estimate that our rates will increase approximately to  retroactive to september  we estimate that our rates will increase by approximately in kentucky retroactive to january  in addition  we expect the approximately rate increase we were scheduled to receive on october  will be accelerated to july  these rate increases apply to all regions other than the newly launched region although premiums are generally contractually payable to us before or during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members  we have experienced delays in premium payments from certain states 
given the budget shortfalls in many states with which we contract  additional payment delays may occur in the future 
provider reimbursement levels are subject to change by the states and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
in addition  some hospital contracts are directly tied to state medicaid fee schedules  resulting in reimbursement levels that may be adjusted up or down  generally on a prospective basis  based on adjustments made by the state to the fee schedule 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  such adjustments 
unless such adjustments are mitigated by corresponding changes in premiums  our profitability will be negatively impacted 
medicare advantage ma as a result of the annual election period  we have expanded our ma service area to a total of counties 
upon the completion of the acquisitions of easy choice and desert canyon  we expanded our ma services to california and arizona and grew our presence in florida  georgia  illinois  new york  and texas 
we also now offer our ma plans to some of the dually eligible members we currently serve through the kentucky medicaid program 
prescription drug plans pdp based on the outcome of our stand alone prescription drug plan pdp bids  our plans are below the benchmarks in of the cms regions and within the de minimis range of the benchmark in five other cms regions 
comparatively  in  our plans were below the benchmark in five regions and within the de minimis range in other regions 
in  we will be auto assigned newly eligible members into our plans for the regions that are below the benchmark 
we will retain our auto assigned members in the five regions in which we bid within the de minimis range  however  we will not be auto assigned new members in those regions during members previously auto assigned to our pdp plans in regions for which our bids were not within the de minimus range will be reassigned to other plans in consequently  membership has declined to approximately  as of january  a decrease from  as of december  due to the reassignment to other plans of members who were previously auto assigned to us  primarily in california  offset in part by additional auto assignments to us in other regions and an increase in the members who actively chose our pdp plans 
we expect membership for the remainder of to be relatively stable 
a decrease in premium rates will further affect our pdp segment results of operations in dual eligibles as of january  three states have executed memorandums of agreement with cms to participate in the duals alignment demonstration program  a key step in demonstration implementation  and eighteen states are still negotiating with cms on their demonstration parameters 
cms has issued guidance that no programs will begin before april  and the target enrollment will be limited to to million beneficiaries 
exact implementation times vary by state 
cms has issued guidance indicating that dual eligible beneficiaries participating in the states duals alignment demonstration programs cannot be forced to remain in a duals alignment plan and will be allowed to switch between plans on a monthly basis 
however  enrollment in a ma plan is limited to the federally designated annual enrollment period or in the event of a special election period unless the individual seeks to enroll in a plan that has obtained a score of on medicare quality performance system star ratings 
none of our health plans have yet achieved stars 
for this reason  dual eligible beneficiaries subject to a dual alignment demonstration program will only be able to elect to remain in or join a wellcare plan during the annual enrollment period or special election periods 

table of contents the guidance promulgated by cms requires a cost savings to both medicare and medicaid 
to the extent that the assumed savings are deemed unrealistic  these programs could limit the number of states in which we choose to provide services 
if the rates are deemed sufficient to support the provision of high quality care  we may choose to bid for participation in these programs 
in addition  certain states programs have not permitted us to participate  due to our plan program design 
for those states that have a duals eligible demonstration program in which we do not participate  the membership in our ma and pdp plans in those states would be reduced 
per cms guidance  part d auto assignments to another pdp will be limited to january   and january   for and demonstration states  respectively

table of contents membership vs 
as of december   we served approximately  members  an increase of approximately  members from december  we experienced membership growth in both our medicaid and ma segments when compared to december   which was offset by a decline in pdp membership 
medicaid segment membership increased by  mainly from membership growth in florida  membership growth in our kentucky medicaid program following its launch in the fourth quarter of and subsequent open enrollment in november  and membership growth in our hawaii medicaid program due to our participation in hawaii quest program beginning in july our kentucky medicaid membership increased from  at december  to  at december  members participating in the kentucky medicaid program were able to switch plans until january   and membership has also increased due to retroactive member re assignments 
ma segment membership increased by  compared to december   due to the easy choice acquisition  and as a result of the annual election period during  which resulted in an increase of approximately  members effective january   as well as our continued focus on dually eligible beneficiaries and expansion into new counties 
excluding the easy choice plan  december membership was  up from december in our pdp segment  membership decreased by  compared to december  as a result of our pdp bids  which resulted in the reassignment to other plans  effective january   of members who were auto assigned to us in or prior years

the decrease in our medicaid segment results were due to the impact of higher net favorable development of prior period medical benefits payable experienced in  the relatively higher mbr in the kentucky medicaid program  and a million reduction to premium revenue recorded during the third and fourth quarters of related to a reconciliation of duplicate member records in georgia dating back to the beginning of the program in these decreases were partially offset by the impact of higher membership and related premium revenues and the impact of rate increases in certain markets 
the improved result in our ma segment was due to increased membership and related premium revenues  while the improvement in the pdp segment resulted mainly from favorable claims experience 
the increase in sg a was driven primarily by higher membership  but the rate of increase was lower than the overall rate of increase in premium revenues

such increases were partially offset by an increase in sg a expense and interest incurred on debt 
premium revenue vs 
premium revenue for the year ended december  increased by approximately  million  or  compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to membership growth in our medicaid and ma segments and rate increases in certain of our medicaid markets  offset by a million reduction to premium revenue related to a reconciliation of duplicate member records in the georgia medicaid program dating back to the beginning of the program in premium revenue includes million and million of medicaid premium taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively

premium revenue for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or  compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to membership growth during in our pdp and ma segments  rate increases in certain of our medicaid markets  the launch of our kentucky medicaid program in november and additional premiums recognized in connection with retrospective maternity claims in georgia

the increases were partially offset by lower expense in the medicaid segment resulting principally from the impact of net favorable prior period development in medical benefits payable and our medical expense initiatives 
for the year ended december   medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately million of net favorable development related to prior years 
for the year ended december   medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately million of net favorable reserve development related to prior years 
the increased net favorable development of prior years medical benefits payable experienced in compared to was primarily related to unusually low utilization in our medicaid segment in that became clearer over time as claim payments were processed and more complete claims information was obtained 
effective january   we reclassified to medical benefits expense certain costs related to quality improvement activities that were formerly reported in sg a expense 
the quality improvement costs that we reclassified are consistent with the criteria specified and defined in guidance issued by the department of health and human services hhs for costs that qualify to be reported as medical benefits under the minimum medical loss ratio provision of the acts and include preventive health and wellness and care management  case and disease management  health plan accreditation costs  provider education and incentives for closing care gaps  health risk assessments and member outreach  and information technology costs related to the above activities

please refer to note commitments and contingencies within the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of investigation related litigation and other resolution costs 
we believe it is appropriate to evaluate sg a expense exclusive of these investigation related litigation and other resolution costs because we do not consider them to be indicative of long term business operations 
additionally  as discussed above  we reclassified costs related to quality improvement activities that were formerly reported in sg a expenses to medical benefits expense effective january  for the years ended december  and  sg a expense decreased by million and million  respectively  due to the reclassification

excluding investigation related litigation and other resolution costs  our sg a expense for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  to million 
the increase was due to technology investments  including those required by regulatory changes  as well as medical cost initiatives  increased spending related to the launch of our kentucky medicaid program  and other growth initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by improvements in operating efficiency 
our sg a expense as a percentage of total revenue  excluding premium taxes sg a ratio  was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in after excluding the investigation related litigation and other resolution costs  our sg a ratio in was compared to for the same period in the improvement in our sg a ratio  excluding investigation related litigation and other resolution costs  is related to the growth in premium revenue and improvement in our administrative cost structure driven by business simplification projects  process management in our shared services functions  and continued evaluation of our organizational design 
the improvement was partially offset by costs incurred from debt incurred in to settle investigation related litigation that was later redeemed in the fourth quarter of  and quality  regulatory and growth initiatives 
looking ahead to  our growth and other initiatives are driving a need for certain investments 
in particular  the integration of our recent acquisitions into our infrastructure will result in incremental expenditures 
in addition  we will invest to improve the performance of these businesses and position them for further growth 
finally  as we plan for  we will be making investments to meet the needs of our state and federal customers resulting from implementation of the provisions of the acts 
as a result of these and other expenditures  we anticipate that our adjusted administrative expense ratio  excluding investigation related litigation and other resolution costs for will be consistent with

after excluding the investigation related litigation and other resolution costs  our sg a ratio for was compared to for the same period in the improvement in our sg a ratio  excluding investigation related litigation and other resolution costs  represents solid progress toward our long term goal of ensuring our competitive cost position  based on our current business and geographic mix 
business simplification projects  process management in our shared services functions  and continued evaluation of our organizational design continued to drive improvement in our administrative cost structure  partially offset by spending related to the launch of our kentucky medicaid program  increased costs associated with our medicare annual election period strong sales performance  and costs incurred for other growth  regulatory and quality initiatives 
an additional factor impacting the comparability of the periods was the impact of relatively low equity based compensation expense resulting from a larger impact from forfeiture activity in compared to medicaid premium taxes vs 
medicaid premium taxes incurred in the year ended december  were million compared to million  for the same period in the increase corresponds to the increase in medicaid premium revenues 
vs 
medicaid premium taxes incurred in the years ended december  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the increase in medicaid premium taxes in was mainly due to the reinstatement of premium taxes by georgia in july in october  georgia stopped assessing taxes on medicaid premiums remitted to us  which resulted in an equal reduction to premium revenues and medicaid premium taxes 
however  effective july   georgia began assessing premium taxes again on medicaid premiums 
therefore  during the first half of  we were not assessed  nor did we remit  any taxes on premiums in georgia 
interest expense vs

segment reporting reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the company decision makers to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments 
accordingly  we have three reportable segments medicaid  ma and pdp 
segment performance measures we use three measures to assess the performance of our reportable operating segments premium revenue  medical benefits ratio mbr and gross margin 
mbr measures the ratio of medical benefits expense to premiums revenue excluding medicaid premium taxes 
gross margin is defined as our premium revenue less medical benefits expense 
for further information regarding premium revenues and medical benefits expense  please refer below to premium revenue recognition and premiums receivable  and medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable under critical accounting estimates 
our primary tools for measuring profitability are gross margin and mbr 
changes in gross margin and mbr from period to period depend in large part on our ability to  among other things  effectively price our medical and prescription drug plans  manage medical costs and changes in estimates related to ibnr claims  predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the primarily fixed premiums we receive  negotiate competitive rates with our health care providers  and attract and retain members 
in addition  factors such as changes in health care laws  regulations and practices  changes in medicaid and medicare funding  changes in the mix of membership  escalating health care costs  competition  levels of use of health care services  general economic conditions  major epidemics  terrorism or bio terrorism  new medical technologies and other external factors affect our operations and may have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we use gross margin and mbrs both to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions  including which health care plans to offer  which geographic areas to enter or exit and which health care providers to select 
although gross margin and mbrs play an important role in our business strategy  we may be willing to enter new geographical markets and or enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable gross margin and mbr if those arrangements  such as capitation or risk sharing  would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs or for other reasons

because medicaid premium taxes are included in the premium rates established in certain of our medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense  we exclude these taxes from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that their impact is not indicative of operating performance 
for gaap reporting purposes  medicaid premium taxes are included in premium revenue 

table of contents vs 
excluding medicaid premium taxes  medicaid premium revenue for the year ended december  increased when compared to the same period in the increase was driven mainly by the kentucky medicaid program operating for a full year in  compared to two months in  as well as membership growth in that program  both the managed long term care program and the carve in of the pharmacy benefit in our new york medicaid program  membership growth in florida  and rate increases implemented in most markets in late the increase in kentucky medicaid premiums also reflects the open enrollment in november partially offsetting these increases was a million reduction of premium revenue recorded during the third and fourth quarters of related to a reconciliation of duplicate member records in georgia dating back to the beginning of the program in medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended december  increased when compared to the same period in the increase was due mainly to the increase in membership and the relatively higher mbr in the kentucky medicaid program and less net favorable development of prior year medical benefits payable in than we recognized in  partially offset by the impact of medical cost initiatives that we have implemented 
our medicaid mbr for the year ended december  increased by basis points when compared to the same period in the increase was mainly driven by the relatively higher mbr in the kentucky medicaid program  the million reduction of premium revenue for duplicate member record reconciliation adjustments  and the impact of less net favorable development of prior year medical benefits payable in than we recognized in the kentucky medicaid program mbr for the year ended december  was approximately due to the relatively high transitional medical benefit expenses for the program  including the impact of new members from the november open enrollment which have a higher mbr than previously existing members 
we continue to focus on our clinical management capabilities to appropriately address the characteristics of the kentucky members we serve 
in particular  we are executing on emergency room  inpatient  behavioral  and pharmacy cost management activities  all of which are reducing medical costs 
we believe the actions we have taken  and are taking  to improve care coordination and manage costs  combined with expected revenue enhancements and rate increases  will make a meaningful contribution to our medicaid gross margin and the long term stability and soundness of our kentucky medicaid program 
vs 
excluding medicaid premium taxes  medicaid premium revenue for the year ended december  increased when compared to the same period in the increase in premium revenue was mainly due to rate increases in certain markets  the launch of the kentucky medicaid program on november  and additional premiums related to certain retrospective maternity claims that were impacted by a change that the georgia dch made to its methodology for determining and accepting qualifying maternity claims 
medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended december  decreased slightly when compared to the same period in due mainly to the impact of net favorable reserve development of prior period medical benefits payable and the impact of medical cost initiatives that we have implemented  partially offset by a change in member mix and the launch of the kentucky medicaid program in november the net favorable reserve development resulted primarily from unusually low utilization in our medicaid mbr improved by approximately basis points in compared to  and the decrease was also driven by the net favorable reserve development of prior period medical benefits payable  the impact of medical cost initiatives  rate increases in certain of our medicaid markets and additional premiums recognized in connection with retrospective maternity claims in georgia 
outlook we expect medicaid segment premium revenue to increase in excess of percent  mainly as a result of the kentucky program expansion and the south carolina acquisition 
we currently anticipate our premium revenue from the kentucky medicaid program will be in excess of billion 
we currently anticipate that our medicaid segment mbr will be lower in as a result of improved performance for the kentucky program  offset in part by mbr increases in certain other programs and the continuing shift in the mix of our medicaid segment programs toward higher mbr populations

the decrease in membership and in premium rates is expected to result in a minimum reduction in our pdp segment premium revenue in when compared to liquidity and capital resources each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us 
additionally  we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry 
the parent and other non regulated companies non regulated subsidiaries are dependent upon dividends and management fees from our regulated subsidiaries  most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions 
for a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity  see part i item a risk factors included in this form k 

table of contents liquidity the company maintains liquidity at two levels the regulated subsidiary level and the non regulated subsidiary level 
regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries primary liquidity requirements include payment of medical claims and other health care services  management fees paid to our non regulated administrator subsidiary under intercompany services agreements and direct administrative costs  which are not covered by the intercompany services agreement  such as selling expenses and legal costs  and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement 
our regulated subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by maintaining appropriate levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  generating cash flows from operating activities  mainly from premium revenue  cash flows from investing activities  including investment income and sales of investments  and capital contributions received from our non regulated subsidiaries 
we refer collectively to the cash  cash equivalents and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as regulated cash and investments  respectively 
our regulated subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services  however  regulated cash and cash equivalents can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners 
our unrestricted regulated cash and investments was  million as of december   a decrease of million from december  included in this change is million in dividends and surplus capital paid to  and million of contributions received from our non regulated subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus 
we continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated subsidiaries 
see further discussion under regulatory capital requirements and dividend restrictions below 
parent and non regulated subsidiaries liquidity requirements at the non regulated parent level generally consist of payment of administrative costs not related to our regulated operations  including  but limited to  business development  branding and certain information technology services  capital contributions paid to our regulated subsidiaries  capital expenditures  debt service  and federal tax payments 
our non regulated subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by management fees received from our non regulated administrator subsidiary under intercompany services agreements  dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries  collecting federal tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries  proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities  and cash flows from investing activities  including investment income and sales of investments 

table of contents our unregulated cash  cash equivalents and investments was million as of december   a decrease of million from a balance of million as of december  the decrease is mainly attributable to million in net cash used in relation to our recent acquisitions  payment of certain investigation related litigation and other resolution costs in connection with our settlement of the civil division of the us department of justice the civil division and million in capital contributions made to certain of our regulated subsidiaries that were partially offset by million in dividends and surplus capital received from our regulated subsidiaries 
auction rate securities as of december   million of our long term investments were comprised of municipal note securities with an auction reset feature auction rate securities  which are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities and carry investment grade credit ratings 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every seven or days 
as of the date of this form k  auctions have failed for our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions will succeed in the future 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non existent 
in addition  while all of our auction rate securities currently carry investment grade ratings  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
although auctions continue to fail  we believe we will be able to liquidate these securities without significant loss 
there are government guarantees or municipal bond insurance in place and we have the ability and the present intent to hold these securities until maturity or market stability is restored 
accordingly  we do not believe our auction rate securities are impaired and as a result  we have not recorded any impairment losses for our auction rate securities 
however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments recorded value 
the final maturity of the underlying securities could be as long as years 
the weighted average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is years

for further information regarding the subordinated notes  refer to note debt to the consolidated financial statements 
initiatives to increase our unregulated cash we are pursuing alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash 
some of these initiatives include  but are not limited to  consideration of obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to access any available excess capital and or accessing the debt and equity capital markets 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions each of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation 
the minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  a percentage of certain liabilities  a statutory minimum  risk based capital rbc requirements or other financial ratios 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the naic  and have been adopted by most states 
as of december   our operating hmo and insurance company subsidiaries in all states except california  new york and florida were subject to rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state 
the rbc formula  based on asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which represents the amount of capital required to support the regulated entity business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of of the required acl or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
our subsidiaries operating in texas and ohio are required to maintain statutory capital at rbc levels equal to and  respectively  of the applicable acl 
failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state 
at december   our hmo and insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum capital requirements 
the combined statutory capital and surplus of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  compared to the required surplus of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum capital requirements changes over time 
for instance  rbc requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate 
these subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers 
for example  the state of new york adopted regulations that increase the reserve requirement annually until in addition  regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituencies 
moreover  if we expand our plan offerings in a state or pursue new business opportunities  we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash 
dividend restrictions vary by state  but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to restrictions relating to statutory capital  surplus and net income for the previous year 
some states require prior approval of all dividends  regardless of amount 
states may disapprove any dividend that  together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior months  exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income 
for the years ended december   and  we received million  million and million respectively  in cash dividends from our regulated subsidiaries

based on the terms of the settlement agreement reached with the civil division effective as of march   as discussed in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
we are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party  however  we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table above 
critical accounting estimates in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with gaap 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition and premiums receivable  medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable  and goodwill and intangible assets  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
premium revenue recognition and premiums receivable our medicare contracts with cms renew annually 
our contracts with various state medicaid programs generally are multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 
our medicare and medicaid contracts establish fixed  monthly rates per member pmpm 
however  our medicare contracts also have additional provisions as described in the medicare section below 
the premiums we receive for each member vary according to the specific government program and are generally determined at the beginning of each new contract renewal period or each state fiscal year  however  premiums may be adjusted by cms and state agencies throughout the terms of the contracts in certain cases  as described below 
annual rate changes are recorded when they become effective 
for a full description of the revenue elements related to our segments  see part i item business our product segments 
we recognize premium revenue in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
we are generally paid by cms and state agencies in the month in which we provide services 
on a monthly basis  we bill members for any premiums for which they are responsible according to their respective plan 
any amounts that have been earned and have not been received are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as premiums receivable 
any amounts received by us in advance of the period of service are recorded as unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheets and are not recognized as revenue until the respective services have been provided 
we estimate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of member billings that may not be fully collectible based on historical trends 
an allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible 
historically  the allowance for member premiums receivable has not been significant relative to premium revenue 
in addition  we routinely monitor the collectability of specific premiums receivable  including medicaid receivables for obstetric deliveries and newborns see medicaid below and net receivables for member retroactivity as described below  and reflect any required adjustments in current operations 
premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by cms and state agencies 
we verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program 
from time to time  cms and state agencies require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received for individuals who were subsequently determined by us  or by cms or state agencies  to be ineligible for any government sponsored program or to belong to a plan other than ours 
additionally  the verification of membership may result in additional premiums due to us from cms and state agencies for individuals who were subsequently determined to belong to our plan for periods in which we received no premium for those members 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly 
as applicable  the estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information 
the amounts receivable or payable identified by us through reconciliation and verification of membership eligibility lists  which relate to current and prior periods  are included in premiums receivable  net and other accrued expenses and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
medicaid in some instances  our medicaid fixed base pmpm premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the health profile of our membership 
generally  the risk score is determined by the state agency analysis of encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state medicaid membership 
in some states  supplemental payments are received for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings 
in contracts with certain states  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments for obstetric deliveries and newborns 
each contract is specific as to how and when these supplemental payments are earned and paid 
upon delivery of a newborn  the state agency is notified according to the contract terms 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member 
we have settled with the georgia department of community health the georgia dch regarding retroactive premium adjustments related to a reconciliation of duplicate member records dating back to the beginning of the program in as a result  we revised our previous estimate for additional premium revenue receivable related to a previous settlement negotiated with the georgia dch in and we have recorded related reductions of premium revenue totaling approximately million during the third and fourth quarters of the settlement resolved issues with certain premium payments that covered the period from the inception of the program through the settlement  and resulted from a comprehensive review and negotiation involving the three health plans that operate in the program 
minimum medical expense provisions our florida medicaid and healthy kids contracts and illinois medicaid contract require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical benefits expense 
to the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical benefits expense  we are required to refund all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical benefits expense 
we estimate the amounts due to the state agencies as a return of premium based on the terms of our contracts with the applicable state agency 
such amounts are included in results of operations as reductions of premium 
medicare advantage ma the amount of premiums we receive for each ma member is established by contract  although the rates vary according to a combination of factors  including upper payment limits established by cms  a member geographic location  age  gender  medical history or condition  or the services rendered to the member 
changes to monthly premiums are also based upon a member health status as described under medicare risk adjusted premiums below 
we also offer coverage of prescription drug benefits under the medicare part d program as a component of most of our ma plans 
see further discussion of revenue recognition policies specific to medicare part d in pdp below 
medicare risk adjusted premiums cms employs a risk adjustment model to determine the premium amount it pays for each medicare member 
the risk adjustment model apportions premiums paid to all plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled and pays more for ma members with predictably higher costs 
we collect claims and encounter data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings and submit the data to cms  within prescribed deadlines  which are used to calculate the risk adjusted premiums we receive 
cms establishes the premium payments to ma plans generally at the beginning of the plan year  and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis 
the first retroactive adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year 
this initial settlement represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year 
cms then issues a final retroactive risk adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year 
we develop our estimates for ma risk adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience  or other data  and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each cms plan year 
our estimates are periodically updated as additional diagnosis code information is reported to cms and are adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from cms or we receive notification from cms of such settlement amounts 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences between the amounts that we have recorded and ultimately received  however  it is possible that adjustments to premium revenue could have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in a particular period 
the data provided to cms to determine members risk scores is subject to audit by cms even after the annual settlements occur 
an audit may result in the refund of premiums to cms 
while our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund payable to cms  future refunds could materially reduce premium revenue in the year in which cms determines a refund is required 
pdp substantially all the premium that we receive for medicare part d coverage is paid by cms  and the balance is due from enrolled members 
the premium amounts received from cms are based on the plan year bid submitted to cms 
the monthly payment is a risk adjusted amount per member and is based upon the member health status as determined by cms  as more fully described above under medicare risk adjusted premiums 
as we do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our stand alone pdp members  we cannot anticipate changes in our members risk scores 
changes in cms premiums related to risk score adjustments for our stand alone pdp membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and collectability is reasonably assured  which occurs when we are notified by cms of such adjustments 
low income cost sharing  catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount subsidies low income cost sharing  catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount subsidies represent funding from cms for which we assume no risk 
the receipt of these subsidies and the payments of the actual prescription drug costs related to the low income cost sharing  catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discounts are not recognized as premium revenues or benefits expense  but are reported on a net basis as funds receivable held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets 
these receipts and payments are reported as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
approximately nine months after the close of the annual plan year  except for the coverage gap discount which has a longer settlement timeframe  cms reconciles actual experience to prospective payments paid to our plans and any differences are settled between cms and our plans 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments related to the cms annual reconciliation of prior plan year low income cost sharing and catastrophic reinsurance subsidies or coverage gap discount subsidies  due to its recent implementation 
cms risk corridor premiums received from cms are subject to risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions 
the cms risk corridor calculation compares our actual experience to the target amount of prescription drug costs  limited to costs under the standard coverage as defined by cms  less rebates included in our submitted plan year bid 
variances of more than above the target amount result in additional payments by cms to us 
variances of more than below the target amount require us to refund amounts to cms 
we estimate the risk corridor receivable or payable throughout the year as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period and reflect any adjustments to premium in current operations 
this estimate provides no consideration of future pharmacy claims experience  but does require us to consider factors that may not be certain  including membership  risk scores  prescription drug events  and rebates

estimating medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable the cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of incurred but not reported ibnr medical benefits 
medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and estimates for ibnr  and includes direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratories and pharmacies 
recorded direct medical expenses are reduced by the amount of pharmacy rebates earned  which are estimated based on historical utilization of specific pharmaceuticals  current utilization and contract terms 
pharmacy rebates earned but not yet received from pharmaceutical manufacturers are included in pharmacy rebates receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
direct medical expenses may also include reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers 
in these instances  we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons 
based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us  such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant 
also  included in direct medical expense are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement  claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
medically related administrative costs such as preventive health and wellness  care management  case and disease management  and other quality improvement costs are included in medical benefits expense 
other medically related administrative costs such as utilization review services  network and provider credentialing and claims handling costs  are recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the following table provides a detail of the components of medical benefits payable december  of total december  of total in millions ibnr other medical benefits payable total medical benefits payable medical benefits payable is the most significant estimate included in the consolidated financial statements 
we use a consistent methodology to record management best estimate of medical benefits payable based on the experience and information available to us at the time 
this estimate is determined utilizing standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions  which vary by business segment 
these standard actuarial methodologies include using  among other factors  contractual requirements  historic utilization trends  the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  benefits changes  expected health care cost inflation  seasonality patterns  maturity of lines of business and changes in membership 
the factors and assumptions described above that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us 
the ultimate claims payment amounts  patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset  since we  the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas 
standard accepted actuarial methodologies  discussed above  would allow for this inherent variability 
this can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid 
conversely  during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature  we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience 
with more reliable data  we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts  therefore  we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid 
in developing our estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable  we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee pmpm costs for prior months  which costs have been estimated using completion factors  in order to estimate the pmpm costs for the most recent months 
we validate our estimates of the most recent pmpm costs by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease such as congestive heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  diabetes cases  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and size of our membership 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitation as opposed to a fee for service basis 
these considerations are reflected in the trends in our medical benefits expense 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
management uses considerable judgment in determining medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
we believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of december  is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date  however  actual payments may differ from established estimates 
if the completion factors we used in estimating our ibnr for the year ended december  were decreased by  our net income would decrease by approximately million 
if the completion factors were increased by  our net income would increase by approximately million 
after determining an estimate of the base reserve  actuarial standards of practice require that a margin for uncertainty be considered in determining the estimate for unpaid claim liabilities 
if such a margin is included  the claim liabilities should be adequate under moderately adverse conditions 
therefore  we make an additional estimate in the process of establishing the ibnr  which also uses standard actuarial techniques  to account for moderately adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than estimated compared to the base reserve 
we refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions 
the provision for moderately adverse conditions is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnr reserve and is intended to capture the potential adverse development from factors such as our entry into new geographical markets  our provision of services to new populations such as the aged  blind and disabled  the variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical cost  changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  variations in claims processing speed and patterns  claims payment  the severity of claims  and outbreaks of disease such as the flu 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states  we make an overall assessment of ibnr after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for moderately adverse conditions 
we consistently apply our ibnr estimation methodology from period to period 
we review our overall estimates of ibnr on a monthly basis 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our assumptions accordingly to change our estimate of ibnr 
therefore  if moderately adverse conditions do not occur  evidenced by more complete claims information in the following period  then our prior period estimates will be revised downward  resulting in favorable development 
however  when a portion of the development related to the prior year incurred claims is offset by an increase determined to address moderately adverse conditions for the current year incurred claims  we do not consider that development amount as having any impact on net income during the period 
if moderately adverse conditions occur and are more than we estimated  then our prior period estimates will be revised upward  resulting in unfavorable development  which would decrease current period net income 
changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submissions and our payment processes result in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all of which influence the resulting medical cost trend 
differences between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability  which we refer to as prior period developments  are recorded in the period when such differences become known and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense in such periods 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable years ended december  in millions balances as of beginning of period medical benefits incurred related to current period prior periods total medical benefits paid related to current period prior periods total balances as of end of period medical benefits payable recorded at december   and developed favorably by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
a portion of the prior period development was attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions  which is included as part of the assumptions 
the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year 
accordingly  the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period 
in addition to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions  medical benefits expense for the years ended december   and was impacted by approximately million  million and million respectively  of net favorable development related to prior years 
the net favorable development in was due to the medical cost trend emerging favorably  mostly in our medicaid segment and to a lesser extent in our ma and pdp segments  primarily due to lower than projected utilization  partially offset by higher than expected medical services in kentucky 
the net favorable development during was attributable to the medical cost trend emerging favorably than we originally estimated  mostly in our medicaid segment and to a lesser extent in our ma segment  primarily due to lower than projected utilization 
the net favorable development in was primarily associated with the exit of the pffs product on december  the factors impacting the changes in the determination of medical benefits payable discussed above were not discernible in advance 
the impact became clearer over time as claim payments were processed and more complete claims information was obtained 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in our business climate occur that may potentially affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill or intangible assets 
events or changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership  state funding  federal and state government contracts and provider networks 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
if  based on the qualitative assessment  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value  we perform a two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the first step is to determine the fair value of the reporting unit using both the income and market approach 
in doing so  we must make assumptions and estimates  such as projected revenues and the discount factor  in estimating fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and may produce significantly different results 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we measure and record the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value 
we select the second quarter of each year for our annual goodwill impairment test  which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting process  with the test completed during the third quarter of that year 
based on the results of the qualitative assessments performed as of our most recent testing date in  and our review at december   we determined that the fair value of our medicaid reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying value as of december  our review included consideration of the termination of our missouri and ohio medicaid contracts as discussed in part i item business our product segments 
recently adopted accounting standards refer to note summary of significant accounting policies  included in the consolidated financial statements for information and disclosures related to new accounting standards which are incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
investment return market risk as of december  and  our short term investment portfolio of million and million  respectively  consisted of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months  as well as longer term bonds with floating interest rates that we consider available for sale 
we held restricted investments of million and million  at december  and  respectively  which consist principally of cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments required by various state statutes or regulations 
these restricted assets are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states requirements 
because of the short term nature of short term and restricted investments  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
at december  and  we held investments classified as long term in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the investments classified as long term are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our long term fixed income investments would decrease by approximately million 
similarly  a decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments by less than million 
interest rate market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our amended credit agreement  as amended  which is subject to variable interest rates dependent upon the adjusted libor for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus an applicable margin 
interest rate changes impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
based on outstanding debt balances and interest rates as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates on our amended credit agreement would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
similarly  a basis point decrease in assumed interest rates would decrease annual interest expense by million
