item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included herein 
competition the market for primary aluminum is global  and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region 
we compete with us and international companies in the aluminum industry primarily in the areas of price  quality and service 
in addition  aluminum competes with materials such as steel  copper  carbon fiber  composites  plastic and glass  each of which may be substituted for aluminum in certain applications 
our hawesville plant is located adjacent to its largest customer 
this location allows hawesville to deliver a portion of its production in molten form  at a cost savings to both parties  providing a competitive advantage over other potential suppliers 
we believe that hawesville also has a competitive advantage in that it currently is the largest producer of high purity aluminum in north america 
for additional information  see item a  risk factors we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate 
customer base in  we derived approximately of our consolidated sales from our three major customers glencore international together with its subsidiaries  glencore  southwire company southwire  and bhp billiton 
additional information about the revenues and percentage of sales to these major customers is available in

the amended power agreement provides that mt 
holly may continue to receive its supplemental power requirements from the off system facility through december  century aluminum of kentucky  our wholly owned subsidiary caky entered into an arrangement the big rivers agreement to provide power for hawesville s full production capacity requirements approximately megawatts mw with pricing based on the provider s cost of production 
the big rivers agreement is take or pay for hawesville s energy requirements at full production 
under the terms of the big rivers agreement  any power not consumed by hawesville will be made available for sale and we will receive credits for actual power sales up to our cost for that power 
in august  caky issued a month notice to terminate its power contract with kenergy  a member cooperative of big rivers electric corporation big rivers  for hawesville 
during the month notice period  we will be required to pay a demand charge for power  but we are not obligated to continue operating the plant 
we believe that the contract price hawesville pays for electric power under the big rivers agreement is among the highest rates for smelters in the us caky is engaged in discussions with big rivers  kenergy and other stakeholders to access the wholesale market for power

a summary of key labor agreements is provided below 
facility organization term hawesville uswa through march  ravenswood uswa expired august  grundartangi icelandic labor unions through december  pricing our operating results are highly sensitive to changes in the price of primary aluminum and the value of regional premiums  as well as the cost of electrical power  raw materials and supplies used in production 
as a result  from time to time  we assess the appropriateness of mitigating the effects of fluctuations in these items through the use of various fixed price commitments and financial instruments 
we purchase alumina for all of our facilities and electrical power at grundartangi at prices indexed to the price of primary aluminum  this mechanism provides a natural hedge in the pricing of some of our largest production costs 
in addition  in recent years  we have purchased primary aluminum put option contracts to protect our downside price risk exposure for a significant portion of our domestic production 
we hold no such option contracts today 
generally  we price our products at an indexed or market price  in which the customer pays an agreed upon premium over the lme price or other market indices 
grundartangi derives most of its revenues from tolling arrangements whereby it converts alumina provided by its customers into primary aluminum for a fee based on the lme price for primary aluminum 
grundartangi revenues are subject to market price risk associated with the lme price for primary aluminum  however  because grundartangi tolls alumina for its customers  it is not exposed to fluctuations in the price of alumina for its tolling production 
grundartangi s tolling revenues include a premium based on the european union eu import duty for primary aluminum 
any decreases in the eu import duty could have a negative impact on grundartangi s revenues 
primary aluminum facilities grundartangi the grundartangi facility  located in grundartangi  iceland  is owned and operated by our subsidiary  nordural grundartangi ehf 
grundartangi is our most modern and lowest cost facility

item a 
risk factors the following describes certain of the risks and uncertainties we face that could cause our future results to differ materially from our current results and from those anticipated in our forward looking statements 
these risk factors should be considered together with the other risks and uncertainties described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere herein 
this list of significant risk factors is not all inclusive or necessarily in order of importance 
the cyclical nature of the aluminum industry causes variability in our earnings and cash flows 
our operating results depend on the market for primary aluminum  which is a highly cyclical commodity with prices that are affected by global demand and supply  political and economic conditions and other related factors 
for example  aluminum warehouse inventory levels are at historically high levels  which may cause primary aluminum prices to fall as such inventory enters the market 
historically  aluminum prices have been volatile  and we expect such volatility to continue 
cash aluminum price  as quoted on the lme  averaged approximately  per metric ton in  this level is below the average price of approximately  per metric ton for the previous five years 
declines in primary aluminum prices reduce our earnings and cash flows 
if the price we realize for our products falls below our cost of production  we may choose or be forced to curtail operations to fund our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to take actions necessary to curtail operations  if these steps are required 
future downturns in aluminum prices may significantly reduce the amount of cash available to meet our obligations and fund our long term business strategies and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions  results of operations and liquidity 
disruptions to  or changes in the terms of our raw material and electricity supply arrangements could increase our production costs 
our business depends upon the adequate supply of alumina  electricity  aluminum fluoride  calcined petroleum coke  pitch  finished carbon anodes and cathodes and other materials at competitive prices 
disruptions to the supply of these production inputs could occur for a variety of reasons  including disruptions of production at a particular supplier s facility or power plant 
for some of these production inputs  such as power and anode supply  we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers 
many of our supply agreements expire in the next few years 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to renew such agreements at commercially favorable terms  if at all 
we have notified the power supplier to our hawesville facility of our intention to terminate the power contract for the facility  and are currently in disputes or negotiations with certain of the power providers to our icelandic facilities 
any disruption may require us to purchase these products on the spot market on less favorable terms than under our current agreements due to the limited number of suppliers of these products or other market conditions 
in some instances  we may be unable to secure alternative supply of these resources 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain alumina in the future at prices that are based on the lme 
because we sell our products based on the lme price for primary aluminum  we would not be able to pass on any increased costs of raw material that are not linked to the lme price to our customers 
a disruption in our materials or electricity supply may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to secure alternate supplies of materials or electrical power at comparable prices 
certain of our alumina and electricity supply contracts contain take or pay obligations 
we have obligations under certain contracts to take or pay for specified quantities of alumina and electricity over the term of those contracts regardless of our operating requirements 
our financial position and results of operations may therefore be adversely affected by the market price for alumina and electric power even if we were to curtail unprofitable production capacity or delay construction of new capacity as we will continue to incur costs under these contracts to meet or settle our contractual take or pay obligations 
if we were unable to use such electrical power or raw materials in our operations or sell them at prices consistent with or greater than our contract costs  we could incur significant losses under these contracts 
in addition  these commitments may also limit our ability to take advantage of favorable changes in the market prices for electricity or raw materials and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
increases in electricity costs adversely affect our business 
electricity represents our single largest operating cost 
as a result  the availability of electricity at economic prices is critical to the profitability of our operations 
portions of the contracted cost of the electricity supplied to mt 
holly and all of hawesville s electricity costs vary with the supplier s costs 
an increase in these costs would increase the price these facilities pay for electricity 
costs under the hawesville electricity contract have substantially increased in recent years with rising fuel prices and other factors 
as these contracts have take or pay type provisions  the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of hawesville and mt 
holly may be adversely affected by the price for electric power even if we curtail unprofitable production capacity 
significant increases in electricity costs at any of our operations may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
while natural gas based power facilities may provide lower priced alternatives to coal based power facilities  we may be unable to take advantage of such lower costs due to our existing power contracts 
losses caused by disruptions in our supply of power would adversely affect our operations 
we use large amounts of electricity to produce primary aluminum 
any loss of power which reduces the amperage to our equipment or causes an equipment shutdown would result in a reduction in the volume of molten aluminum produced  and prolonged losses of power may result in the hardening or freezing of molten aluminum in the pots where it is produced  which could require an expensive and time consuming restart process 
interruptions in the supply of electrical power to our facilities can be caused by a number of circumstances  including unusually high demand  blackouts  equipment or transformer failure  human error  malicious acts  natural disasters or other catastrophic events 
see unpredictable events  including natural disasters  dangerous weather conditions  terrorist attacks and political unrest  may adversely affect our ability to conduct business below 
at several of our facilities  an alternative supply of power in the event of a disruption may not be feasible 
if such a condition were to occur  we may lose production for a prolonged period of time and incur significant losses 
we operate our plants at close to peak amperage 
accordingly  even partial failures of high voltage equipment could affect our production 
we maintain property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events  but are required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those insurance policies 
in addition  the coverage under those policies may not be sufficient to cover all losses  or may not cover certain events 
certain of our insurance policies do not cover any losses that may be incurred if our suppliers are unable to provide power during periods of unusually high demand 
certain losses or prolonged interruptions in our operations may trigger a default under certain of our outstanding indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we have notified our power provider at hawesville of our intention to terminate its power contract  if we are unable to successfully negotiate better power pricing  we might close the facility 
our subsidiary  century aluminum of kentucky  has issued a month notice to terminate its power contract with kenergy for the hawesville smelter effective during the month notice period  century is required to pay a demand charge for power  but is not obligated to continue operating the plant 
we believe that our hawesville facility would be competitive globally but for the price it pays for electric power  which is among the highest such rates for smelters in the us under current economic conditions  we have determined that the smelter is not economically viable with this power rate and that we must obtain better power pricing to maintain its viability 
upon termination of our power contract  century will be required to make alternative power arrangements to pay spot prices for power at the plant  which are subject to variability 
in addition  kenergy or other third parties may seek to challenge our ability to operate the plant under alternative power arrangements 
if circumstances change  we may try to enter into a hedging arrangement with respect to power prices at the plant  which could be expensive and may require collateral 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain better pricing  in which case we may proceed with closing the facility 
such a closure would impose various costs on us that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  uncertainty regarding the future operation of the smelter may damage our relationship with our customers  suppliers  employees and other stakeholders  whether or not the smelter is ultimately curtailed for instance  due to the gradual nature of any curtailment  we may need to take actions to terminate customer and supply contracts  curtail individual potlines  or issue warn notices to employees well in advance of the termination of the power contract 
customers and suppliers may also become unwilling to renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts with us 
it may also become more difficult to attract and retain employees 
such actions and events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
international operations expose us to political  regulatory  currency and other related risks 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from our international operations  primarily in iceland 
these operations expose us to risks  including unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations  political and economic instability  challenges in managing foreign operations  increased costs to adapt our systems and practices to those used in foreign countries  taxes  export duties  currency restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
changes in foreign laws and regulations are generally beyond our ability to control  influence or predict and future adverse changes in these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
in addition  we may be exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
as a result  an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could increase our operating expenses which are denominated and payable in those currencies 
as we continue to explore other opportunities outside the us  including the expansion program at grundartangi and the helguvik project and the restart of the vlissingen carbon production assets  our currency risk with respect to the icelandic krona  the euro and other foreign currencies will significantly increase 
if economic  financial and political conditions in iceland were to deteriorate  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
iceland is important to our business 
disruptions in iceland s economic  financial and political systems have decreased the stability of iceland s economy and financial markets and made cash management activities in iceland more challenging 
for example  the icelandic government and the central bank of iceland are restricting the transfer of funds into and outside of iceland 
while we are currently exempt from these foreign currency rules  we cannot control further actions by the central bank of iceland which might restrict our ability to transfer funds through the icelandic banking system and outside of iceland 
while we currently maintain essentially all of our icelandic operating funds in accounts outside of iceland  and are receiving substantially all of our customer payments in such accounts  a portion of our funds remain in the icelandic banks to meet local working capital requirements 
in addition  as payables become due in iceland  we must transfer funds through the icelandic banking system 
if economic  financial or political conditions in iceland deteriorate  or if counterparties and lenders become unwilling to engage in normal banking relations with and within iceland  our ability to operate our grundartangi smelter  including paying vendors  processing payroll and receiving payments  as well as our ability to complete the helguvik project  could be adversely impacted  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
curtailment of unprofitable aluminum production at our us facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
curtailing unprofitable production to reduce our operating costs requires us to incur substantial expense  both at the time of the curtailment and on an ongoing basis 
our facilities are subject to contractual and other fixed costs that continue even if we curtail operations at these facilities 
these costs reduce the cost saving advantages of curtailing unprofitable aluminum production 
our subsidiary  caky  has issued a month notice to terminate its power contract for the hawesville smelter and may curtail operations if it is unable to negotiate satisfactory power pricing 
see we have notified our power provider at hawesville of our intention to terminate its power contract  if we are unable to successfully negotiate better power pricing  we might close the facility above 
if we are unable to realize the intended effects of any production curtailment  including at our currently curtailed ravenswood facility  or if any production curtailment does not achieve sufficient reduction in operating expenses  we may have to seek bankruptcy protection for some or all of our us subsidiaries and or may be forced to divest some or all of our us subsidiaries 
if we were to seek bankruptcy protection for these subsidiaries  we would face additional risks 
such action could cause concern among our customers and suppliers generally  distract our management and our other employees and subject us to increased risks of lawsuits 
other negative consequences could include negative publicity  which could have a material negative impact on the trading price of our securities and negatively affect our ability to raise capital in the future 
any curtailments of our us operations  or actions taken to seek bankruptcy protection or divest some or all of our us subsidiaries  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we require substantial resources to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures 
we require substantial resources to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures  including construction at our helguvik smelter site and the expansion programs at our grundartangi smelter and vlissingen anode production facility 
in addition  if we were to resume operations at our ravenswood smelter  we would incur substantial capital expenditures  working capital funding and operating expenses 
if we are unable to generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures and other obligations  our ability to continue to meet these cash requirements in the future could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds  including from capital and credit markets 
changes in us and global economic conditions  including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity  and the success of plans to manage costs  inventory and other important elements of our business  may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations 
if  among other factors  primary aluminum prices were to decline  our costs are higher than contemplated  we suffer unexpected production outages  or icelandic laws change and either increase our tax obligations or limit our access to cash flow from our icelandic operations  we would need to identify additional sources of liquidity 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unacceptable terms  we may be unable to respond to competitive pressures  take advantage of market opportunities or fund operations  capital expenditure or other obligations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
construction at our helguvik smelter site has been significantly curtailed 
substantial delay in the completion of this project may increase its cost  subject us to losses and impose other risks to completion that are not foreseeable at this time 
nordural helguvik ehf  our indirect  wholly owned subsidiary  has significantly curtailed construction activity and spending at our helguvik project in response to the recent global economic conditions  icelandic economic and political conditions and ongoing negotiations with the power companies contracted to provide power to the helguvik project 
see if we are unable to procure a reliable source of power  the helguvik project may not be feasible  and if economic  financial and political conditions in iceland were to deteriorate  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
nordural helguvik cannot be certain when or if it will restart major construction and engineering activities or ultimately complete the helguvik project or  if completed  that the helguvik smelter would operate in a profitable manner 
we will not realize any return on our significant investment in the helguvik project until we are able to commence helguvik operations in a profitable manner 
if we fail to achieve operations at helguvik  we may have to recognize a loss on our investment  which would have a material adverse impact on our earnings 
many of the contractual arrangements related to the helguvik project have time periods for performance 
the delay in restarting major construction and completing the helguvik project has caused nordural helguvik to renegotiate and extend  or undertake to renegotiate and extend  existing contractual commitments  including with respect to power  transmission  technology  equipment and construction 
there can be no assurance that the contractual arrangements and conditions  including extensions  necessary to proceed with construction of the helguvik project will be obtained or satisfied on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  such approvals or extensions may be subject to conditions that are unfavorable or make the project impracticable or less attractive from a financial standpoint 
we may also become liable to some of our suppliers for damages relating to delays in the project 
for instance  the first stage of power under one of the helguvik power purchase agreements approximately mw became available in the fourth quarter of and we are obligated to take or pay for at least of such power 
this power is currently being utilized at grundartangi  but the power providers to grundartangi have disputed our ability to do so in an arbitration proceeding 
if we are unable to utilize such power at grundartangi  we may be subject to significant damages as a result 
even if we receive the necessary approvals and extensions on terms that we determine are acceptable  the construction of this project is a complex undertaking 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the project within our projected budget and schedule 
to successfully execute this project  in addition to procuring a reliable source of power  we will need to arrange additional financing and either enter into tolling arrangements or secure a supply of alumina as well as other materials 
furthermore  unforeseen technical difficulties could increase the cost of the project  delay the project or render the project infeasible 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures from future capital raising  available cash and cash flow from operations 
we may be unable to raise additional capital  or do so on attractive terms  due to a number of factors  including a lack of demand  poor economic conditions  interruptions in the capital markets  unfavorable interest rates or our financial condition or credit rating at the time 
if additional capital resources are unavailable  we may further curtail construction and development activities 
further delay in the completion of the project or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
if we are unable to procure a reliable source of power  the helguvik project may not be feasible 
the helguvik project will require generation and transmission of a substantial amount of electricity to power the smelter 
nordural helguvik has entered into agreements with two providers of geothermal power  hs and or 
each of hs and or has alleged that certain conditions to the delivery of power under the power agreements have not yet been satisfied 
if we are unable to reach agreement with each of hs and or  we may have to seek alternative sources of power  incur substantially increased power costs or further curtail construction activities of the helguvik project 
due to the limited number of icelandic power providers with resources sufficient to provide power to the helguvik project only three are currently in operation in iceland  we may find it difficult or impossible to procure additional sources of power if hs and or do not perform under their existing agreements and may be unable to complete construction of the smelter 
if we agree to pay increased prices for power or substantially delay or are unable to complete the helguvik project  we may have to recognize a substantial loss on our investment 
any failure to complete the helguvik project  or any further delays in completing the project could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the generation of the contracted power for the helguvik project will also require successful development of new geothermal energy sources within designated areas in iceland and completion of the necessary transmission infrastructure to service the helguvik project 
if there are construction delays or technical difficulties in developing these new geothermal energy sources or transmission infrastructure  power may be delayed or may not be available 
development of the generation and transmission infrastructure is expensive and requires significant resources from the power and transmission providers 
factors which could delay or impede the generation and transmission of electric power are substantially beyond our ability to control  influence or predict  including the power and transmission providers ability to finance and obtain necessary permits  real property and other rights for the development of new geothermal energy sources and associated transmission infrastructure 
in addition  if nordural helguvik is unable to proceed with the helguvik project  it may incur significant reimbursement obligations for certain costs incurred by third party providers under transmission and other agreements entered into in connection with the helguvik project and remain subject to significant power commitments already confirmed under its agreement with or 
if the power or transmission providers are unable to provide or transmit the contracted amounts of power  such failure could substantially delay or make the helguvik project infeasible and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
union disputes could raise our production costs or impair our production operations 
the bargaining unit employees at our grundartangi  hawesville and ravenswood smelters are represented by labor unions 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with any labor union representing our employees  our labor contracts may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at any of these facilities in the future 
any threatened or actual work stoppage in the future or inability to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements could prevent or significantly impair our ability to conduct production operations at our unionized facilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or changes in the business or financial condition of our major customers 
in  we derived approximately of our consolidated sales from our three major customers southwire  glencore and bhp billiton 
we currently have long term primary aluminum sales or tolling contracts with each of these customers 
however  a significant downturn or further deterioration in the business or financial condition of one of these major customers could affect our results of operations 
in addition  a loss of any of these customers or failure to renew one of these major contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our ability to access the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms may be limited due to our credit ratings  our financial condition or the deterioration of these markets 
our credit rating was  and continues to be  adversely affected by unfavorable market and financial conditions  curtailment of our ravenswood smelter and the substantial levels of our existing indebtedness 
our availability under our revolving credit facility is dependent on our domestic accounts receivable and inventory which secure the facility 
curtailment of production capacity at ravenswood has reduced the amount of domestic accounts receivable and inventory available to secure this facility and further curtailments of domestic production capacity could further reduce availability under our revolving credit facility 
our existing credit ratings  or any future negative actions the credit agencies may take  could negatively affect our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future and could lead to worsened trade terms  increasing our liquidity needs 
in addition  approximately million of our existing debt under our notes and notes will become due in an inability to access capital and credit markets when needed in order to refinance our existing debt  raise new debt or equity or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate 
we are engaged in a highly competitive industry 
aluminum also competes with other materials  such as steel  copper  plastics  composite materials and glass  among others  for various applications 
many of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and technical resources than we do 
these larger competitors may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions 
similarly  competitors with superior cost positions to ours may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions 
if we are not able to compete successfully  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
because we own less than a majority of some of our operating assets  we cannot exercise complete control over their operations 
we have limited control over the operation of some of our operating assets  including the mt 
holly smelter and the bhh carbon anode and cathode facility  because we beneficially own less than a majority of the ownership interests in such assets 
while we seek to exert as much influence with respect to the management and operation of such assets as possible  we are dependent on our co owners to operate such assets 
our co owners may not have the level of experience  technical expertise  human resource management and other attributes to operate these assets optimally 
in addition  our co owners may have interests  objectives and incentives with respect to such assets that differ from our own 
we require significant cash flow to meet our debt service requirements  which increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  reduces cash available for other purposes and limits our operational flexibility 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of outstanding debt  million of which will become due in we may incur additional debt in the future 
the level of our debt could have important consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  reducing cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  working capital and other general corporate purposes  because a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to servicing our debt  and limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  competitive and other changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 
we have various obligations to make payments in cash  including contractual commitments  pension funding  and certain contingent obligations  that will reduce the amount of cash available to make interest payments required on our outstanding debt and for other uses 
our industrial revenue bonds irbs and any future borrowings on our credit facility are at variable interest rates  and future borrowings required to fund working capital at our businesses  construction of the helguvik project  acquisitions  or other strategic opportunities may be at variable rates 
an increase in interest rates would increase our debt service obligations under these instruments  further limiting cash flow available for other uses 
in addition to our debt  we have liabilities and other obligations which could reduce cash available for other purposes and could limit our operational flexibility 
our ability to pay interest on and to repay or refinance our debt and to satisfy other commitments will depend upon our access to additional sources of liquidity and future operating performance  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors  including market prices for primary aluminum  that are beyond our control 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay debt service obligations  refinance our existing debt or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other liquidity needs  we could attempt to restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity or debt capital 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to accomplish those actions on satisfactory terms  or at all  and if we are unable to ultimately meet our debt service obligations and fund our other liquidity needs  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
despite our substantial level of debt  we may incur more debt  which could exacerbate any or all of the risks described above 
we may incur substantial additional debt in the future 
although the loan and security agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior secured notes due the notes limits our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt  these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and  under certain circumstances  debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
for example  as of december   approximately million was available to us for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  the loan and security agreement governing our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the notes do not prevent us from incurring certain obligations that do not constitute debt as defined in these agreements 
to the extent that we incur additional debt or such other obligations  the risks associated with our substantial debt described above  including our possible inability to service our debt or other obligations  would increase 
we depend upon intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations 
we are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon the receipt of intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries 
subject to the restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our notes  future borrowings by our subsidiaries could contain restrictions or prohibitions on intercompany transfers by those subsidiaries 
in addition  under applicable law  our subsidiaries could be limited in the amounts that they are permitted to pay as dividends on their capital stock 
for example  the icelandic government and the central bank of iceland are currently restricting the free transfer of funds outside of iceland 
while we are currently exempt from these foreign currency rules  we cannot control further actions by the central bank of iceland which might restrict our ability to transfer funds through the icelandic banking system and outside of iceland 
future declines in the financial markets and or our curtailment actions could have significant and adverse effects on our pension funding obligations 
we maintain two qualified defined benefit plans  and contribute to a third  on behalf of our employees 
as a result of poor investment returns and historically low discount rates which result in higher pension liabilities  the benefit plans we maintain were underfunded as of december  if capital markets experience further significant losses  pension fund balances would likely fall and additional cash contributions to the pension funds will be required 
additionally  in june  the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc informed us that it believed that a cessation of operations under the employee retirement income security act of erisa had occurred at our ravenswood facility as a result of the curtailment of operations at the facility and requested that we engage in discussions with the pbgc relating thereto 
while we do not believe a cessation of operations under erisa has occurred  if such a determination is ultimately made by the pbgc  it may be necessary for cawv to accelerate the timing of additional contributions to certain of its defined pension plans or post other collateral with the pbgc or negotiate an alternative agreement 
we may be required to write down the book value of certain assets 
we are required to perform various analyses related to the carrying value of various assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that their net carrying amount may not be recoverable 
given the recent lack of profitability of certain of our production facilities and recent global economic conditions  which in part drive assumptions for the future in such analyses  we could have significant adjustments in the carrying value for certain assets 
for instance  if we do not eventually resume operations at ravenswood  we may be required to recognize a loss related to all or a portion of the assets of this facility 
in the future  we will continue to evaluate our assets for impairments and valuation allowance  which could be significant 
any such adjustments would be in the form of a non cash charge which would reduce our earnings and reduce our balance of retained earnings 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
climate change  climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations 
climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are the subject of significant attention in the countries in which we operate and a number of governments or governmental bodies in these countries have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change 
for example  as a member of the european economic area and a signatory to the kyoto protocol  iceland has implemented legislation to abide by the kyoto protocol and prepare to abide by directive ec of the european parliament which establishes a cap and trade scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading 
because iceland was granted emissions allowances under the kyoto protocol through  iceland has implemented directive ec  and is complying with the directive by participating in the eu emission trade scheme the ets from january  although we will receive approximately of needed carbon dioxide allowances for the grundartangi smelter free of charge  the economic impact of implementing this system is not fully known as cost of allowances could rise and we cannot be certain that helguvik will be granted free allowances if the project is completed 
in addition  we are aware of proposed us legislation that if enacted  among other things  would implement a cap and trade system of allowances and credits in the united states or otherwise impose significant costs on us and our suppliers and customers 
implementation of these potential regulatory changes or others is uncertain and may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact our operations directly or indirectly through customers or our supply chain 
as a result of the foregoing  we may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with such regulatory changes  increased energy costs  costs associated with a cap and trade system  increased insurance premiums and deductibles  a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly  from changes in costs of goods sold 
for example  cap and trade legislation may impose significant additional costs to our power suppliers that could lead to significant increases in our energy costs 
in addition  the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances 
these may include changes in rainfall patterns  shortages of water or other natural resources  changing sea levels  changing storm patterns and intensities  and changing temperature levels 
any adverse regulatory and physical changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that could result in costs or liabilities 
we are obligated to comply with various foreign  federal  state and other environmental laws and regulations  including the environmental laws and regulations of the united states  iceland  china and the eu 
environmental laws and regulations may expose us to costs or liabilities relating to our manufacturing operations or property ownership 
we incur operating costs and capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  we are currently and may in the future be responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former facilities or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources 
if more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed  previously unknown environmental conditions or damages to natural resources are discovered or alleged  or if contributions from other responsible parties with respect to sites for which we have cleanup responsibilities are not available  we may be subject to additional liability  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
further  additional environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known  with respect to sites previously owned or operated by us  by related corporate entities or by our predecessors  or at sites that we may acquire or operate in the future 
in addition  overall production costs may become prohibitively expensive and prevent us from effectively competing in price sensitive markets if future capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance or cleanup are significantly greater than expected 
unpredictable events  including natural disasters  dangerous weather conditions  terrorist attacks and political unrest  may adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from operations in areas that have heightened risk of natural disasters  including iceland 
iceland suffered several natural disasters and extreme weather events in  and  including significant volcanic eruptions and earthquakes 
in addition  our grundartangi smelter lost power for approximately three hours in january as the result of damage sustained due to abnormal and extreme weather conditions at an off site electrical substation owned and operated by the national power grid operator 
future unpredictable events  including natural disasters  dangerous weather conditions  terrorist attacks and political unrest  may adversely affect our ability to conduct business by causing disruptions in icelandic  chinese  dutch  us or global economic conditions  inflicting loss of life  damaging property and requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage and restore operations at our production facilities 
acquisitions may present difficulties 
we have a history of making acquisitions and we expect to opportunistically seek to make acquisitions in the future 
we are subject to numerous risks as a result of our acquisition strategy  including the following we may spend time and money pursuing acquisitions that do not close  acquired companies may have contingent or unidentified liabilities  it may be challenging for us to manage our existing business as we integrate acquired operations  and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions 
accordingly  our past or future acquisitions might not ultimately improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and may subject us to additional liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
any restart of the ravenswood smelter would involve significant risks and uncertainties in  we curtailed all operations at our ravenswood smelter 
any potential restart of operations at the ravenswood smelter would involve significant risks and uncertainties  including we may spend time and incur significant costs and liabilities pursuing a restart that does not occur or that does not achieve the anticipated benefits  and it may be challenging for us to manage our existing business as we restart operations at ravenswood 
accordingly  any potential restart of operations at ravenswood might not ultimately improve our competitive position and business prospects as anticipated and may subject us to additional liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change under the internal revenue code 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion  after adjusting for losses carried back to previous tax years  which could offset future taxable income 
our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets to offset future federal taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in general  an ownership change would occur if our five percent shareholders  as defined under the code  collectively increase their ownership in us by more than percentage points over a rolling three year period 
future transactions in our stock that may not be in our control may cause us to experience such an ownership change and thus limit our ability to utilize net operating losses  tax credits and other tax assets to offset future taxable income
