item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all dollar amounts are stated in thousands of dollars 
overview the york water company the company is the oldest investor owned water utility in the united states  operated continuously since in  the company purchased the assets and began operating its first wastewater collection and treatment system 
the company is a purely regulated water and wastewater utility 
profitability is largely dependent on water revenues 
due to the size of the company and the limited geographic diversity of its service territory  weather conditions  particularly rainfall  economic  and market conditions can have an adverse affect on revenues 
market conditions and the economy in general are recovering very slowly from the recession 
as a result  there was very little organic growth in the customer base and existing customers reduced their water usage 
in  total water usage per customer declined by compared to  due to an above average amount of rainfall and conservation efforts by customers 
in addition  the deductibility of bonus depreciation for state tax purposes was not effective for resulting in higher income taxes than in despite these hurdles  the company was able to increase revenues in compared to due to the collection of the distribution system improvement charge dsic and growth in the customer base through acquisitions 
the dsic allows the company to add a charge to customers bills for qualified replacement costs of certain infrastructure without submitting a rate filing 
the company also held operating expenses to a less than increase over the company business does not require large amounts of working capital and is not dependent on any single customer or a very few customers for a material portion of its business 
in  operating revenue was derived from the following sources and in the following percentages residential   commercial and industrial   and other  which is primarily from the provision for fire service 
the customer mix helps to reduce volatility in consumption 
the company seeks to grow revenues by increasing the volume of water sold through increased consumption and increases in the number of customers served  and the timely filing for rate increases 
the company continuously looks for acquisition and expansion opportunities both within and outside its current service territory as well as through contractual services and bulk water supply 
entry into the wastewater business provides opportunities for the company to expand its business 
the company has entered into agreements with several municipalities to provide sewer billing services 
in  the company began a service line protection program as a pilot program 
opportunities to expand both initiatives are being pursued as they further diversify the business 
performance measures company management uses financial measures including operating revenues  net income  earnings per share and return on equity to evaluate its financial performance 
additional statistical measures including number of customers  customer complaint rate  annual customer rates and the efficiency ratio are used to evaluate performance quality 
these measures are calculated on a regular basis and compared with historical information  budget and the other publicly traded water and wastewater companies 
the company performance in was strong under the above measures 
increased rates from the collection of the dsic and increases in the number of customers mostly as a result of acquisitions resulted in higher revenue and offset the higher income taxes incurred in the overall effect was an increase in net income in over of and a return on year end common equity of  which was consistent with 
table of contents page the efficiency ratio  which is calculated as net income divided by revenues  is used by management to evaluate its ability to control expenses 
over the five previous years  the company ratio averaged 
in  the ratio was higher than the average at due to the higher net income resulting from higher revenue and controlled expenses 
management is confident that its ratio will again exceed that of its peers 
management continues to look for ways to decrease expenses and increase efficiency as well as to file for rate increases promptly when needed 
results of operations compared with net income for was  an increase of  or  from net income of  for the primary contributing factors to the increase in net income were higher operating revenues and lower expenses for power  the provision for doubtful accounts  tank remediation and life insurance 
the increased income was partially offset by higher expenses for income taxes  depreciation  salary and wage  and distribution system maintenance  and reduced capitalized overhead 
operating revenues for the year increased  or  from  for to  for the primary reasons for the increase were the disc and an increase in customers 
the dsic added an additional to revenues during as compared to the average number of customers served in increased as compared to by customers  from  to  customers 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a decrease in the total per capita volume of water sold in as compared with commercial per capita consumption increased  but residential and industrial per capita consumption decreased 
the company expects revenues for to increase moderately based on the continuation of the distribution surcharge and a potential rate increase toward the end of the year 
other regulatory actions and weather patterns could impact results 
operating expenses for the year increased  or  from  for to  for the increase was primarily due to higher depreciation expense of approximately  increased salary and wage expense of approximately  reduced capitalized overhead of approximately and increased distribution system maintenance expense of approximately other expenses increased approximately the increase was partially offset by reduced power expense of approximately due primarily to credits for voluntary electric curtailment events in which the company participated  a lower provision for doubtful accounts of approximately due to a prior year adjustment for additional inactive accounts and reduced expense of approximately for the prior year tank remediation project 
the company expects depreciation expense to continue to rise in due to investment in utility plant  and other operating expenses are expected to increase at a moderate rate as costs to serve customers and to extend the distribution system continue to rise and fewer electric curtailment events are anticipated 
interest on debt for decreased  or  from  for to  for the decrease was primarily due to lower long term debt outstanding and lower variable interest rates 
during and  there were no borrowings under the lines of credit 
interest expense for is expected to remain consistent with allowance for funds used during construction increased  from for to in  due to a higher volume of eligible construction 
allowance for funds used during construction is expected to show a modest increase in based on a projected increase in the amount of construction expenditures 
other income expenses  net for reflects decreased expenses of as compared to the same period of the net change was primarily due to lower employee retirement expense of approximately due to a smaller impact from the decline in the discount rate in as compared to and lower expense on life insurance policies of approximately as the value of retirement assets increased in as compared to the increase in value was partially offset by life insurance proceeds which benefited and were not repeated in other expenses aggregating approximately also decreased as compared to the same period of in  other income expenses will be largely determined by the change in market returns and discount rates 

table of contents page income taxes for increased  or  compared to the company effective tax rate was for and for the higher effective tax rate in and the resulting increase in taxes were primarily due to the deductibility of bonus depreciation for state purposes in  which was not available in taxes on higher income also added to the increase

operating revenues for the year increased  or  from  for to  for the primary reason for the increase in revenues was a rate increase effective november  the rate increase was partially offset by a lower volume of water sold 
the total per capita volume of water sold in decreased compared to by approximately 
the decrease is mainly attributed to lower residential consumption due to record rainfall 
commercial and industrial consumption was also slightly lower than last year 
the average number of customers served in increased as compared to by customers  from  to  customers 
operating expenses for the year increased  or  from  for to  for the increase was primarily due to higher depreciation expense of approximately due to increased plant investment  higher pension expense of approximately due to increased contributions  higher distribution system maintenance expense of approximately primarily due to a tank remediation project and a higher provision for doubtful accounts of approximately due to additional inactive accounts 
also contributing to the increase were higher salary and wage expense of approximately and other expenses aggregating approximately interest on debt for increased  or  from  for to  for the increase was primarily due to interest of on the senior notes  series a  issued in october of offsetting the increase were lower interest payments of on the company lines of credit due to reduced borrowings  lower interest of due to retirement of the industrial development authority revenue refunding bonds  series  in june of and other lower interest expense of during  there were no borrowings under the lines of credit

effective january   the company tariff included a distribution surcharge on revenues of 

table of contents page acquisitions see note to the company financial statements included herein for a discussion of its completed acquisitions 
on march   the company closed on the acquisition of the windy brae mobile home park water assets of barkas  inc in york county  pennsylvania  at a purchase price of the company will begin serving approximately new customers through an interconnection with its current distribution system 
this acquisition is expected to be immaterial to total company results 
the company is also pursuing other bulk water contracts and acquisitions in and around its service territory to help offset further declines in per capita water consumption 
capital expenditures during  the company invested  in construction expenditures for routine items  upgrades to its water treatment facilities  and an upgrade to the enterprise software system as well as various replacements of aging infrastructure 
the company replaced and relined over  feet of main in in addition  the company invested in the acquisitions of water and wastewater systems during the company was able to fund operating activities  construction expenditures and acquisitions using internally generated funds and proceeds from its stock purchase plans see note to the company financial statements included herein 
the company anticipates construction and acquisition expenditures for and of approximately  and  respectively  exclusive of any potential acquisitions 
in addition to routine transmission and distribution projects  a portion of the anticipated and expenditures will be for additional main extensions  further upgrades to water treatment facilities  an additional pumping station  and various replacements of aging infrastructure 
the company intends to use cash on hand and internally generated funds for at least half of its anticipated and construction and fund the remainder through line of credit borrowings  proceeds from its stock purchase plans  the dsic and customer advances and contributions see note to the company financial statements included herein 
customer advances and contributions are expected to account for less than of funding requirements in and potential debt and equity offerings may be utilized if required 
the company believes it will have adequate credit facilities and access to the capital markets  if necessary during  to fund anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources cash the company manages its cash through a cash management account that is directly connected to a line of credit 
excess cash generated automatically pays down outstanding borrowings under the line of credit arrangement 
if there are no outstanding borrowings  the cash is used as an earnings credit to reduce banking fees 
likewise  if additional funds are needed  besides what is generated internally  for payroll  to pay suppliers  or for debt service  funds are automatically borrowed under the line of credit 
the cash balance of  as of december  represents the funds from operations generated internally in primarily due to lower cash required for income taxes due to bonus depreciation 
the company expects the cash balance to decline in based on higher expected capital expenditures and currently allowable bonus depreciation 
after the cash balance is fully utilized  the cash management facility is expected to provide the necessary liquidity and funding for the company operations for the foreseeable future based on its past experience 

table of contents page accounts receivable the accounts receivable balance tends to follow the change in revenues but is also affected by the timeliness of payments by customers and the level of the reserve for doubtful accounts 
a reserve is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated based on inactive accounts with outstanding balances 
management periodically evaluates the adequacy of the reserve based on past experience  agings of the receivables  adverse situations that may affect a customer ability to pay  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
if the status of these factors deteriorates  the company may incur additional expenses for uncollectible accounts and experience a reduction in its internally generated funds 
the company made a one time adjustment during the second quarter of to the allowance and corresponding provision for doubtful accounts for inactive accounts that were written off during the second half of the amount of the adjustment was not considered material to the financial statements 
no further adjustments were required in or are expected in internally generated funds the amount of internally generated funds available for operations and construction depends on the company ability to obtain timely and adequate rate relief  changes in regulations  customers water usage  weather conditions  customer growth and controlled expenses 
in  the company generated  internally as compared to  in and  in the increase in income taxes paid in decreased cash flow from operating activities 
credit lines historically  the company has borrowed  to  under its lines of credit before refinancing with long term debt or equity capital 
as of december   the company maintained unsecured lines of credit aggregating  with three banks at interest rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus 
the company had no outstanding borrowings under any of its lines of credit as of december  the company plans to renew a  line of credit that expires in june under similar terms and conditions 
the credit and liquidity crisis which began in has caused substantial volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets and in the banking industry resulting in increased borrowing costs and reduced credit availability 
since then  the company has experienced more stability as the economy recovers from the recession 
actual interest rates remain low and one of the company banks recently reduced the interest rate on its line of credit 
another bank recently removed the commitment fee from its line of credit 
the company has taken steps to manage the risk of reduced credit availability such as maintaining primarily committed lines of credit that cannot be called on demand and obtaining a year revolving maturity 
despite the general improvements and actions taken  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to obtain sufficient lines of credit with favorable terms in the future 
in addition  if the company is unable to refinance its line of credit borrowings with long term debt or equity when necessary  it may have to eliminate or postpone capital expenditures 
management believes the company will have adequate capacity under its current lines of credit to meet financing needs throughout long term debt the company loan agreements contain various covenants and restrictions 
management believes it is currently in compliance with all of these restrictions 
see note to the company financial statements included herein for additional information regarding these restrictions 
the company debt long term debt plus current portion of long term debt as a percentage of the total capitalization  defined as total common stockholders equity plus long term debt including current portion of long term debt  was as of december   compared with as of december  the company will likely allow the debt percentage to trend upward until it approaches fifty percent before matching increasing debt with additional equity 
a debt to total capitalization ratio near fifty percent has historically been acceptable to the ppuc in that prudent debt costs and a fair return have been granted by the ppuc in rate filings 
see note to the company financial statements included herein for the details of its long term debt outstanding as of december  
table of contents page the company has an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission sec  pursuant to which the company may offer an aggregate remaining amount of up to  of its common stock or debt securities subject to market conditions at the time of any such offering 
the company is not currently planning to issue securities under the shelf registration statement before it expires in may deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions the company has seen an increase in its deferred income tax liability amounts over the last several years 
this is primarily a result of the accelerated and bonus depreciation deduction available for federal tax purposes which creates differences between book and tax depreciation expense 
the company expects this trend to continue as it makes significant investments in capital expenditures and as the tax code continues to extend bonus depreciation 
the company has a substantial deferred income tax asset primarily due to the differences between the book and tax balances of the pension and deferred compensation plans from lower discount rates 
the company does not believe a valuation allowance is required due to the expected generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
the company has determined there are no uncertain tax positions that require recognition as of december  common stock common stockholders equity as a percent of the total capitalization was as of december   compared with as of december  it is the company intent to target a ratio near fifty percent 
credit rating on april   standard poor affirmed the company credit rating at a  with a stable outlook and adequate liquidity 
the company ability to maintain its credit rating depends  among other things  on adequate and timely rate relief  which it has been successful in obtaining  its ability to fund capital expenditures in a balanced manner using both debt and equity and its ability to generate cash flow 
in  the company objectives will be to continue to maximize its funds provided by operations and maintain the equity component of total capitalization 
dividends during  the company dividend payout ratios relative to net income and net cash provided by operating activities were and  respectively 
during  the company dividend payout ratios relative to net income and net cash provided by operating activities were and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  the board of directors increased the dividend by from per share to per share per quarter 
this was the sixteenth consecutive annual dividend increase and the th consecutive year of paying dividends 
the company board of directors declared a dividend in the amount of per share at its january meeting 
the dividend is payable on april  to shareholders of record as of february  while the company expects to maintain this dividend amount in  future dividends will be dependent upon the company earnings  financial condition  capital demands and other factors and will be determined by the company board of directors 
see note to the company financial statements included herein for restrictions on dividend payments 
inflation the company is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs incurred to maintain and expand its service capacity 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs which must be recovered from future cash flows 
the ability of the company to recover this increased investment in facilities is dependent upon future rate increases  which are subject to approval by the ppuc 
the company can provide no assurances that its rate increases will be approved by the ppuc  and  if approved  the company cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which the rate increase was sought 

table of contents page contractual obligations the following summarizes the company contractual obligations by period as of december  payments due by period total less than year years and years and more than years long term debt obligations a interest on long term debt b purchase obligations c defined benefit obligations d deferred employee benefits e other deferred credits f total a represents debt maturities including current maturities 
included in the table is a potential payment of  in years and on the variable rate bonds which would only be due if the bonds were unable to be remarketed 
there is currently no such indication of this happening 
b excludes interest on the  variable rate debt as these payments cannot be reasonably estimated 
the interest rate on this issue is reset weekly by the remarketing agent based on then current market conditions 
also excludes any interest on committed lines of credit due to the variability of both the outstanding amount and the interest rate 
c represents an approximation of open purchase orders at year end 
d represents contributions expected to be made to qualified defined benefit plans 
the contribution may increase if the minimum required contribution as calculated under employee retirement income security act erisa standards is higher than this amount 
the contribution is also dependent upon the amount recovered in rates charged to customers

f represents the estimated settlement payments to be made under the company interest rate swap contract 
in addition to these obligations  the company makes refunds on customers advances for construction over a specific period of time based on operating revenues related to developer installed water mains or as new customers are connected to and take service from such mains 
the refund amounts are not included in the above table because the timing cannot be accurately estimated 
portions of these refund amounts are payable annually through and amounts not paid by the contract expiration dates become non refundable and are transferred to contributions in aid of construction 
see note to the company financial statements included herein for a discussion of its commitments 

table of contents page environmental matters in november  during a routine tank cleaning  the company discovered a small amount of mercury in the bottom of the tank 
the tank was not in service at the time of the discovery and remains out of service 
a number of tests were performed to confirm no mercury entered the water supply and no employees or contractors present during the discovery were impacted 
the tank will remain out of service until it is confirmed that it is free of any mercury 
no disruption of service to any customers has occurred or is expected to occur 
the company incurred total costs of through december  the company continues to clean the tank before submitting for final dep inspection 
if the tank cannot meet the prescribed standard  other options will be reviewed  including a project to reline and strengthen the interior of the tank through capital expenditures 
critical accounting estimates the methods  estimates and judgments the company used in applying its accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in its financial statements 
the company accounting policies require management to make subjective judgments because of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company most critical accounting estimates include regulatory assets and liabilities  revenue recognition and accounting for its pension plans 
regulatory assets and liabilities generally accepted accounting principles define professional standards for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
in accordance with the professional standards  the company defers costs and credits on its balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
these deferred amounts are then recognized in the statement of income in the period in which they are reflected in customer rates 
if the company later finds that these assets and liabilities cannot be included in rate making  they are adjusted appropriately 
see note for additional details regarding regulatory assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition operating revenues include amounts billed to metered water customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on both actual and estimated usage from the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period 
estimates are based on average daily usage for those particular customers 
the unbilled revenue amount is recorded as a current asset on the balance sheet 
actual results could differ from these estimates and would result in operating revenues being adjusted in the period in which the actual usage is known 
based on historical experience  the company believes its estimate of unbilled revenues is reasonable 
pension accounting accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires estimates of future compensation increases  mortality  the discount rate  and expected return on plan assets as well as other variables 
these variables are reviewed annually with the company pension actuary 
the company selected its december  and discount rates based on the citigroup pension liability index 
this index uses the citigroup spot rates for durations out to years and matches them to expected disbursements from the plan over the long term 
the company believes this index most appropriately matches its pension obligations 
the present values of the company future pension obligations were determined using a discount rate of at december  and at december  choosing a lower discount rate normally increases the amount of pension expense and the corresponding liability 
in the case of the company  a reduction in the discount rate would increase its liability  but would not have an impact on its pension expense 
the ppuc  in a previous rate settlement  agreed to grant recovery of the company contribution to the pension plans in customer rates 
as a result  under the professional standards  expense in excess of the company pension plan contribution is deferred as a regulatory asset and will be expensed as contributions are made to the plans and the contributions are recovered in customer rates 
therefore  changes in the discount rate affect regulatory assets rather than pension expense 

table of contents page the company estimate of the expected return on plan assets is primarily based on the historic returns and projected future returns of the asset classes represented in its plans 
the target allocation of pension assets is to equity securities  to fixed income securities  and to cash reserves 
the company used as its estimate of expected return on assets in both and if the company were to reduce the expected return  its liability would increase  but its expense would again remain unchanged because the expense is equal to the company contribution to the plans 
the additional expense would instead be recorded as an increase to regulatory assets 
continued low discount rates and underperformance of assets could cause future required contributions and expense to increase substantially 
if this were to happen  the company would have to consider changes to its pension plan benefits and possibly request additional recovery of expenses through increased rates charged to customers 
other critical accounting estimates are discussed in the significant accounting policies note to the financial statements

this exposure to market risks relates to the company debt obligations under its lines of credit 
as of february  the company has unsecured lines of credit with maximum availability of  with three banks 
the first line of credit  in the amount of  is a committed line of credit with a revolving year maturity currently may  and carries an interest rate of libor plus 
the second line of credit  in the amount of  is a committed line of credit  which matures in may and carries an interest rate of libor plus

the company had no outstanding borrowings under any of its lines of credit as of december  other than lines of credit  the company has long term fixed rate debt obligations as discussed in note to the financial statements included herein and a variable rate pedfa loan agreement described below 
in may  the pennsylvania economic development financing authority  or the pedfa  issued  aggregate principal amount of pedfa exempt facilities revenue bonds  series a 
the proceeds of this bond issue were used to refund the  pedfa exempt facilities revenue bonds  series b of which were refunded due to bond insurer downgrading issues 
the pedfa then loaned the proceeds to the company pursuant to a variable interest rate loan agreement with a maturity date of october  in connection with the loan agreement  the company retained its interest rate swap agreement whereby the company exchanged its floating rate obligation for a fixed rate obligation 
the purpose of the interest rate swap is to manage the company exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate 
if the interest rate swap agreement works as intended  the receive rate on the swap should approximate the variable rate the company pays on the pedfa series a bond issue  thereby minimizing its risk 
see note to the company financial statements included herein
