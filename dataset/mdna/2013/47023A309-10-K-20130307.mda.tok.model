during  we entered a strategic partnership with the department of labor job employment and training administrations which operates the corps advanced culinary program through which we provided internship based learning opportunities for students  while benefitting from the students contribution of culinary knowledge and expertise 
we introduced several products in including fit n fruitful smoothie platform with lean advantage boost a line of fruit forward tasting meal substitutes with balanced nutrition  providing a good source of fiber  essential vitamins and minerals and two or more servings of real  whole fruit 
when used daily  in combination with a healthy diet and exercise program  the lean advantage boost can help support long term weight management goals by stimulating muscle enzymes to burn more fat and promote lean muscle mass

all of our products are tested prior to roll out 
in  we established the idistrict innovation district  a group of company stores where we test all major process enhancements  promotions  and product initiatives 
the testing of new initiatives in our idistrict stores allows us to rapidly integrate relevant store and customer feedback and to quickly make adjustments to improve the quality of products and processes we ultimately deliver to the system 
during  the idistrict was used to validate several new platform ideas such as the toasted bistro sandwiches  and select stores within the idistrict were key to implementing the expansion of our fresh squeezed juice platform which is now fully operational at our flagship emeryville and santa monica store locations in california 
lifestyle engagement we were founded on the belief that maintaining a balance of physical activity  good nutrition  and community involvement are critical to healthy living 
our focus continues to be on how we communicate with consumers  and engage them on achieving and maintaining healthy  active lifestyle 
we continue to develop integrated programs that will deepen and broaden the health and wellness knowledge of the jamba workforce across the system 
company spokespersons  tennis star venus williams and nutrition expert tara gidus  continue to educate and inspire consumers on leading a healthy  active lifestyle 
in may  we established the jamba healthy living council 
the healthy living council is comprised of nationally renowned nutrition and dietary experts tara gidus  ms  rd  cssd  ld n  elizabeth m ward ms  rd and kathleen zelman mph rd ld  and provides consumers with useful  practical information that helps them live a healthier lifestyle 
in addition  the council members are working with us to create healthy living education materials  produce online content for our website  develop school nutrition outreach initiatives  advise management on nutrition trends  and provide input on new menu concepts and healthy choice options as we continue to evolve our product line 
the jamba kids meals platform  which was announced in early january  was designed in partnership with the healthy living council 
we are committed to raising awareness around the importance of a healthy  active lifestyle 
to that end  during we were the official blended fruit beverage and smoothie sponsor of seven events in the popular rock n roll marathon series  organized by the competitor group inc in addition  the organic center  the leading research and education institute focused on the science of organic food and farming  along with other partners including the wnba  national pta  usa water polo  the golden state warriors and nutrition expert tara gidus  supported our annual team up for a healthy america program to raise awareness of the nation s obesity epidemic 
venus williams is the spokesperson for our team up for a healthy america campaign 
we believe that engaging our customers in healthy lifestyle activities helps to improve the quality and consistency of customer service at our stores and will enhance their brand experience 
we continue to believe that such customer engagement will heighten customer loyalty and satisfaction  and ultimately increase frequency of use of our products and our market share 
in march  we developed a master of blending arts mba program to expand the nutritional expertise available to consumers in our stores 
we continue to test this program and plan to rollout in we believe the program has elevated the customer experience at jamba and reinforced our position as a premier provider of healthy lifestyle products by enhancing our team members knowledge in product nutrition  the benefits of juice and juicing  and their expertise in custom beverage creation 
in addition  during  we developed and tested new service standards called boost to create a unique and memorable experience for each customer 
our boost program is being launched in across the jamba system 
we remain focused on opportunities to refine our promotional and communication efforts to drive traffic  build loyalty and to make jamba a top of mind choice for a healthy  active lifestyle 
at our company stores  the team members enjoy access to a broad offering of benefits in support of maintaining a healthy  active lifestyle 
during fiscal and fiscal  jamba was named one of the san francisco bay area s healthiest employers by the silicon valley san jose business journal and the san francisco business times 
jamba was also recognized as one of the largest employer participants in the second half san francisco half marathon 
expand growth initiatives a primary driver to become a billion healthy  active lifestyle brand in total retail sales from all businesses  is our commitment to our growth initiatives 
our growth initiatives encompass the multiple portfolio opportunities we have to expand our restaurant business on a global basis  including traditional and non traditional stores  smaller footprint smoothie stations and the jambago format 
we believe these opportunities will position us for growth in market share  reduce capital outlays  provide better overall margins  allow us to open more locations at an accelerated rate  increase our brand presence to support other company initiatives such as consumer products licensing and direct selling  and increase customer frequency 
we have an additional growth opportunity to expand the jamba brand by establishing more points of distribution inherently achieving a broader brand awareness and deepening brand loyalty by making it easier for consumers to access and enjoy all the products and services jamba has to offer 
we also believe we have significant global market expansion opportunities 
jamba juice domestic we have a portfolio of flexible store formats that can be utilized in a number of different venues 
we generally categorize our stores as either traditional or non traditional locations 
a traditional location is characterized as a business premises that exists primarily as a jamba juice store 
traditional stores average approximately   square feet in size 
these stores are located either in major urban centers or in suburban strip mall centers 
as of january   there were traditional jamba juice store locations 
a non traditional location is characterized as a jamba juice store located within another primary business in conjunction with other businesses or at institutional settings such as colleges and universities  entertainment venues  shopping malls  transportation centers  supermarkets and airports 
a captive audience is a common characteristic of non traditional locations 
we believe one benefit of the development of non traditional stores is to increase awareness of the jamba juice brand to complement the traditional stores in the area 
as of january   there were non traditional jamba juice store locations 
we continue to innovate in the design of traditional and non traditional stores as well 
our goal is to vary the size and format of our stores to allow us to locate them in or near a variety of settings 
as a result  the typical costs to construct a jamba juice non traditional store ranges from  to  and the typical costs to construct a traditional jamba juice store ranges from  to  our flexibility in store construction enables us to develop stores in a variety of venues  broadening the visibility of the jamba brand and giving more customers easier  more convenient access 
in turn  we hope format flexibility will help us to attract qualified franchisees and to assure them of potentially achieving a higher return on their investment in capital expenditures 
in  we developed two new flexible formats  jambago and a limited menu smoothie station that facilitate rapid expansion of healthy menu options into k schools  and entertainment and convenience venues 
the jambago format is a small footprint  low capital and low labor self serve machine format and has proven to be an innovative and differentiated solution for foodservice providers seeking healthier beverage options for their constituents 
this new format will better enable jamba to rapidly expand brand presence 
the jambago concept targets venues servicing captive audiences and with greater demand for higher volumes where the need for high speed service is essential  and where a full sized jamba juice store or kiosk would not be feasible 
such venues include k schools  colleges and universities  grocery and convenience stores  stadiums  theaters  event centers and select airport locations 
the jamba smoothie station concept was launched after completing our testing of the concept in this concept is also an express service utilizing existing technology to make select smoothie flavors in small  efficient spaces 
the smoothie station concept is designed to target venues that require a smaller footprint than our typical non traditional store 
smoothie stations offer a limited menu and use pre portioned fruit and yogurt to produce smoothies comparable to our traditional stores 
targeted venues include colleges and universities  grocery stores  airports  hospitals and business cafeterias 
as of january   there were jamba smoothie stations open in four states 
jamba smoothie stations are included in the total franchise stores count 
as of january   we had jamba juice store locations in the united states  operating in states and washington  dc  consisting of company stores  franchise stores and jambago served locations 
we lease the real estate for all of our company stores 
our market planning has shown that there is potential for at least  total jamba juice stores in the united states  which we believe can be profitable and would meet our current store opening criteria 
during fiscal  franchisees opened new franchise stores  closed franchise stores  and acquired one company store  which is now operating as a franchise store 
franchise opportunity through our franchising program  we offer franchisees choices in store venue  format and number of stores they wish to operate including i traditional stand alone stores  ii nontraditional store venues such as mall  university  supermarket or transit hub locations  and iii multi unit development agreements which grant the franchisee exclusive rights to develop and operate a specified number of stores within a specified period of time within a specified geographic area  which we call development agreements 
our current traditional store franchise agreement provides for an initial year term 
the agreement is renewable for two consecutive year terms  subject to various conditions and state law 
the royalty rate in the current franchise agreement for domestic locations is generally of revenue 
franchisees are also required to contribute an additional percentage of store revenue  not to exceed  to a company administered advertising fund 
throughout  we typically charged of revenue as the marketing contribution for both our traditional store franchisees and non traditional stores in shopping malls 
franchises for traditional stores and stores located in shopping malls are also expected to spend of sales on local marketing efforts 
there is typically up to a one mile geographic radius restriction for traditional stores in non downtown areas 
the royalty rates and marketing contributions for non traditional stores excluding those in shopping malls vary depending upon type transit hub  college or university or supermarket and format standard or blending station utilizing pre portioned ingredients 
franchisees typically pay an initial fee of  or  for traditional and shopping mall store locations and an initial fee ranging from zero to  for non traditional stores 
we generally do not provide any form of financing to our franchisees 
as of january   we had area developers with rights to develop additional franchise stores pursuant to development agreements 
the exclusive territories covered by these agreements include selected markets in the states of arizona  california  colorado  connecticut  florida  hawaii  illinois  indiana  kentucky  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  nevada  new jersey  new york  ohio  oregon  pennsylvania  utah  washington state  washington  dc  and wisconsin 
these developers have aggregated contractual commitments to open additional new franchise stores in their respective territories over the next several years 
nine of the twenty one development agreements were entered into in connection with refranchising transactions  where a purchaser of company stores also agreed to develop new franchise stores 
area developers typically enter into a separate franchise agreement for each store opened 
under typical development agreements  upon execution of the multi unit development agreement  the area developer generally pays  as a development fee  one half of a  initial fee  or  for each store required to be developed 
area developers are obligated to finance their own build out of each store location according to our specifications 
we also continue to strengthen our relationships with beverage and food concessionaires operating at non traditional venues such as colleges  universities  airports and other transit hubs  and other retail and entertainment venues to help maximize our non traditional franchise development 
in addition to our own efforts  we are approached by sophisticated concessionaires and contract feeders whose independent research has identified us as ideal for locations such as colleges and universities  sport venues  airports  and other non traditional venues where they have exclusive rights from venue owners to develop 
when it fits our expansion strategies  these opportunities are incorporated into our own plans 
our market planning and site selection process is integral to the successful execution of our growth strategy 
we have processes for identifying  analyzing  and assigning undeveloped markets for either company store or franchise store development 
once a market is selected  we carefully screen trade areas for demand based on demographic  psychographic and jamba juice specific variables to assess the risk of developing a store or permitting a franchisee to do so 
we review trade areas to ensure that they meet our guidelines for new store development and begin the site selection or approval process 
once a trade area is approved  we carefully screen prospective locations for visibility  traffic patterns  ease of use and co tenancy for potential company store and franchise store locations 
our expansion strategy involves using this market planning and site selection process to leverage areas of demand within each market 
we intend to use this approach to encourage the clustering of stores in specific geographic areas of demand  which we believe will drive brand awareness  improve operating and marketing efficiencies for franchise stores while leveraging the costs associated with regional supervision 
distribution efficiencies can also be realized through this strategy 
in addition  we believe the ability to hire qualified team members is enhanced in markets where jamba is a broadly recognized brand 
jamba juice international franchising we work closely with all of our international partners to build the jamba juice brand and implement the jamba juice system locally  as well as to maximize revenue and margin growth opportunities  recognizing commercial  cultural and dietary diversity in each market 
we have experienced significant growth in our international markets and increased the number of international stores from stores as of january  to stores as of january   with stores located in south korea  the philippines  and canada 
our store in the bahamas closed during the year 
in  we signed a master development agreement with spc group  a leading specialty food company in south korea with over  retail locations across several brands  to develop jamba juice stores in south korea over the next years 
the first jamba juice store opened at the incheon airport in january as of january   there were jamba juice stores operating in south korea 
in april  jamba announced a master development agreement with max s group of companies  a well established restaurant and franchise operator  to develop stores in the philippines over the next years 
the first store opened in manila in november as of january   there were six jamba juice stores operating in the philippines 
in may  we signed a master development agreement with canadian juice corp  the principals of which are world leaders in the frozen yogurt category with over  stores in countries  to develop jamba juice locations over the next years 
the first jamba juice store opened in toronto in october as of january   there were eight jamba juice stores operating in canada 
in addition  we have been collaborating with our canadian partner on plans to introduce the new flexible jambago and smoothie station formats in the canadian market in we believe these new formats will enable a more rapid expansion  and strengthen brand awareness and loyalty in the canadian market 
our brand and products have international appeal and we continue to engage in discussions with additional potential partners regarding the expansion of jamba juice stores into new international markets 
the success of further international expansion will depend on  among other things  local acceptance of the jamba juice concept and menu offerings  and our ability to attract qualified franchise partners 
our agreements take the form of development and franchise agreements under which we typically receive an initial territory fee  store opening fees  and ongoing royalty revenues based on a percentage of sales 
new products  partners  channels and markets during  we shifted our cpg business model from utilizing only a third party licensing structure to one that combines both licensing and direct selling  which allows us to secure greater control over product development  production  distribution  sales and profit 
we initially started with our acquisition of talbott teas in january and our acquisition of the product formulation and intellectual property of the jamba all energy drink from nestle in june we began the initial distribution expansion of our jamba all energy drink in the west coast to add to our distribution in the northeast regional test geography  and we will continue with distribution focus in all mass retail channels across the united states 
talbott teas had a strong showing on abc s shark tank  at the nato summit and was sold on qvc  online and in select retail and hospitality channels 
through our licensed partnerships we launched twelve new better for you skus that included two additional varieties of our make at home smoothie kits  two multigrain crisps  two apple chips  four wraps and two panini sandwiches 
the jamba brand is available across multiple product categories and in major retailers across the country 
as of january   we had approximately individual jamba skus at retail distribution points across states 
we continue to evaluate and meet with potential licensees regarding new product categories that leverage the core brand strength of jamba 
we plan to further extend the presence of the jamba consumer products portfolio through a combination of licensing and direct selling 
this growth will expand accessibility of the brand  will offer consumers unique new jamba branded product solutions and reinforce jamba as a healthy  active lifestyle brand 
drive enterprise efficiencies this strategic priority affects all aspects of our system in our efforts to continue to drive store level profitability  and improve returns for company stores and franchise stores 
strong store level economics are critical to the company s success and therefore management is diligently focused on initiatives to improve these metrics 
in order to drive productivity across the company and to enhance customer experience and speed of service at store level  we introduced a variety of technology enhancements 
these included innovative point of sale technologies such as paypal payment cards  designed to increase the speed of payment at the point of sale and social networking for sharing and collaborating across the jamba system 
effective january   systems services of america ssa is our primary distributor service provider on the west coast of the united states 
our alliance with ssa is expected to reduce costs and increase productivity through access to value added resources and technology 
we anticipate improved supply chain efficiencies and enhanced services to our existing jamba store locations 
in addition  this alliance will facilitate rapid supply chain distribution solutions as we expand into new territories to pursue future growth opportunities 
we continue to make improvements to our workforce management technology to help optimize work schedules  resulting in improved productivity and reduced labor costs as well as improved customer service 
we also monitor our general and administrative expenses so that we may better leverage our existing infrastructure in support of our growth strategy 
we continue to look for opportunities  including the use of innovative technological solutions  for functional improvement in order to drive down expenses and improve productivity 
domestic store operations franchise store management we continuously review franchise store operations  principally through our regional franchise leaders  who are company representatives  who make both scheduled and unannounced visits of franchise stores 
we also review the financial health  operations practices and procedures of our franchisees through business and financial reviews 
we maintain a franchise advisory council fac  which formalizes a channel of communication through a representative group of franchisees to provide advice  counsel and input to us on important issues impacting the business 
our agreement calls for franchise partners to meet certain operational and maintenance requirements  and we work diligently to ensure compliance 
we continue to leverage technology to improve communications  training and collaboration with our stores and franchise partners 
as of january   the jamba system had approximately franchise and international stores and company stores 
our ongoing commitment to building strong relationships with our franchisees has enabled better two way feedback that has helped us to identify best practices and to facilitate more effective and efficient launch of new products and marketing campaigns 
company store management we believe operational excellence throughout the jamba system is vital to the company s success 
our company store field and store operations team plays a critical role in maximizing the performance of our stores across the system 
we recruit and retain leaders with broad experience in management and our industry 
our field leadership consists of a combination of regional directors of operations and district managers to support our company store operations 
our typical company store operations team consists of a combination of a general manager at each store  two to four shift managers and approximately to generally part time team members depending on the time of year 
we continually evaluate opportunities to optimize our labor planning algorithms further to achieve optimal staffing levels throughout the day  which may help us reduce staffing costs at certain stores under certain circumstances 
a major aspect of our blend plan is to continue to engage our customers and to improve the quality and consistency of the customer experience at our stores 
we are devoting significant resources to ensure that all stores across the system offer a superior customer experience  including engaging customers on healthy  active lifestyle activities  and updating the look and feel of the store environment to inspire healthy  active lifestyle 
our store excellence guide is designed to improve operational execution and performance by establishing comprehensive standards which we expect all of our stores to achieve and maintain 
in addition  the bonus program for company store managers rewards customer service goal achievements 
these factors continue to positively impact customer satisfaction during the year and ensure that all stores in the jamba system are delivering against the key drivers of customer satisfaction on a consistent basis 
we believe team members are the key to our success and support the development of a culture that fosters personal interaction  mutual respect  trust  empowerment  enthusiasm and commitment 
maintaining a culture that embodies healthy  active lifestyle in an authentic  fun  friendly and efficient manner in company stores as well as franchise stores is essential as we continue to expand  and we believe that it is critical to developing our brand and ensuring our continued success 
training we conduct various training programs for franchise partners  team members  support center staff and our leadership team on a regular basis 
we are dedicated to providing a meaningful experience for all employees  with ample opportunity to develop leadership skills as they move up through the organization 
our training programs include formal programs such as the manager in training programs for new managers and informal one on one discussions held between general managers  district managers and regional directors of operations 
all of our training programs reinforce the importance of strong customer service and sales skills 
we also make training materials and best practice information available to our franchisees to help create  preserve  and support a singular culture of excellence within all of the stores that comprise our system 
recruiting and retention we carefully screen potential employees to ensure that they hold many of our core values and fit into our culture 
by maintaining this emphasis and encouraging responsibility and accountability at every level  we believe that we have created a sense of team member loyalty and an open and interactive work environment  resulting in a highly passionate workforce 
our employees are paid competitive wages and are offered opportunities for advancement 
in addition to competitive wages  store managers are eligible for performance based bonuses 
we also provide best practice information  qualifications and other information to our franchisees to assist them with hiring and retention and to preserve a singular culture within the stores that comprise our system 
advertising and marketing the health and wellness category remains strong with consumers increasingly seeking better for you food and beverage solutions as part of their lifestyle choices 
in  we leveraged this trend through a variety of innovative products and programs  encouraging consumers to live fruitfully by embracing healthy eating habits and engaging them in an array of initiatives designed to encourage and inspire increased physical activity 
we formed the jamba healthy living council  a panel of three renowned registered dieticians to share healthy living education and information with consumers via videos  articles  online webinars and jamba s website 
these nutrition experts offered insights at key industry conferences like the american dietetic association s fnce conference and the school nutritionist association convention 
as parents themselves  the healthy living council members relate to the dietary concerns of parents and families 
in the second year of our social responsibility program  team up for a healthy america  jamba continued to lead its partners in raising awareness of the importance of physical activity and in supporting our focus on key national health issues such as childhood obesity 
we received nationwide attention by providing local schools and community organizations with much needed athletic equipment 
in we held two fit clinics led by celebrity athletes from the wnba and usa water polo  inspiring children to stay fit and exercise 
our company spokesperson  venus williams  together with gold medal usa water polo athletes  the golden state warriors and other teams and athletes participated in our program as role models for active  healthy living 
community partners such as the national pta  national gardening association  as well as our agencies  vendors and associates also joined forces with us in social media outreach and events to help us further this cause 
national and local marketing funds were used to create programs that expand our communication and reach with consumers through the technology they use and the healthy lifestyle activities they engage in 
we developed local advertising tools and initiatives to drive deeper community engagement which resulted in notable increases in our consumer database and store traffic 
the use of the quick response or qr code  sweepstakes and scratcher tool added fun and excitement to our promotional offering 
our new product campaign launches  social media  advertising and promotion efforts attracted new users to our stores and increased our facebook fan base to over m and twitter followers to  we were a sponsor of the rock roll marathon series as well as supported local youth soccer organizations 
our marketing efforts in have exponentially extended our reach and relevance to consumers 
by improving our use of technology  expanding our reach into sports and other lifestyle activities  helping communities and leading the cause to improve the health and wellness of our nation s youth  we have continued to inspire and simplify healthy living 
through continuous product innovation  we strive to provide consumers with more fun and meaningful solution  to further our significant progress toward our goal of being a leading health and wellness brand 
we partnered with companies such as google  isis and paypal to assess new and preferred payment methods in our retail stores 
in partnership with our it group  our website was redesigned to be more synergistic to popular social media venues and allow for greater user engagement 
jamba s inclusion into the culture and conversations of consumers was evident as we were featured in stories appearing in nationally syndicated journal and newspapers  including nation s restaurant news  franchise world  success magazine  qsr magazine  black enterprise  forbes and the wall street journal 
we also received product placement in television shows and feature films 
our participation in local fundraising events also helped capture a significant amount of coverage from local television and radio stations 
product supply jamba is committed to providing only the finest smoothies  juices and other food products 
smoothie and juice products depend heavily upon supplies of fresh and individually quick frozen iqf fruit 
the quality of each smoothie depends to a large degree on the quality of the basic fruit ingredients from which it is made 
it is essential that the supply of fruit is of the highest quality and is consistent throughout the year 
to achieve these goals we purchase our projected requirements for the coming year from suppliers at the height of the season 
the supply and price of fresh and iqf fruit are dependent upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and are subject to volatility 
supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing regions  including weather  natural disasters and regional political and economic conditions 
we buy certain fruits and dairy using fixed priced or to be fixed priced purchase commitments to secure adequate supply of quality ingredients for our products 
as a result  we have purchase obligations with certain suppliers for certain fruits and dairy for various terms typically ranging from one year to five years 
also  we have one contract with a supplier for a year term that ends in these contracts are commitments to purchase a minimum amount of fruit and other items used in the production of our products and the aggregate costs are estimated at million 
we depend on our relationships with our suppliers for our supply of fruit  dairy and other products 
we believe  based on our established relationships with our suppliers  the risk of non delivery on our purchase commitments is remote 
southwest traders  inc was a distributor of proprietary products to our company stores and franchise stores during and distributed ingredients that made up approximately of cost of goods for jamba juice company 
in october   we signed a new distributor agreement with systems services of america 
effective january   ssa replaced southwest traders as our primary distributor for company and franchise stores in california  arizona and nevada 
in addition  we have distributor agreements with sygma  a subsidiary of sysco  mcdonald  yhata  and us foods 
all of these distributors are leaders in selling  marketing and distributing food products to restaurants and other facilities 
our distributors do not manufacture or negotiate pricing agreements for products sold in our stores 
they serve solely in a warehousing and distribution capacity 
our supply chain and purchasing organization is partly funded by all stores across the jamba system 
this funding contributes to the cost of procurement and management of our supplies and supports our suppliers 
the program allows for a mark up of certain products purchased by company stores and franchise stores  which is subsequently rebated back to the company by the supplier 
competition the retail beverage and food industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
restaurants compete based on a number of factors  including quality  price value relationships  customer service  name recognition  employee hiring and retention and location 
we compete with a variety of purveyors of quick  convenient beverage and food products  including quick service restaurants fast food establishments  coffee shops  donut shops  frozen yogurt shops and grocery stores 
while competition in the beverage and food market is fragmented  competition is increasing  and a major competitor with substantially greater resources than the company could enter the market at any time and compete directly against jamba juice stores 
we compete most directly with regional smoothie stores  most of which are franchises of other smoothie brands 
the rising popularity of convenient and healthy food items resulted in increased competition from non smoothie retailers as they increase their offerings of smoothies and other juice related products  and as we increase our food offerings  we have placed ourselves into direct competition with other quick serve food concepts with well established businesses 
in addition  we also face intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 
there can be no assurance that the company or our franchisees will be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or that the company or franchisees will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel to operate our stores 
government regulation and environmental matters government regulation 
we are subject to extensive and varied federal  state and local government regulation  including regulations relating to public health and safety and zoning codes 
we operate each of our stores in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations 
however  if we could not obtain or retain food or other licenses  it would adversely affect our operations 
although we have not experienced  and do not anticipate  any significant difficulties  delays or failures in obtaining required licenses  permits or approvals  any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of  or adversely impact the viability of  a particular store or group of stores 
california and other states and local jurisdictions have enacted laws  rules  regulations and ordinances which may apply to the operation of a company store  including those which a establish general standards  specifications and requirements for the construction  design and maintenance of the store premises  b regulate matters affecting the health  safety and welfare of our customers  such as general health and sanitation requirements for restaurants  employee practices concerning the storage  handling  cooking and preparation of food  special health  food service and licensing requirements  restrictions on smoking  exposure to tobacco smoke or other carcinogens or reproductive toxicants and saccharin  availability of and requirements for public accommodations  including restrooms  c set standards pertaining to employee health and safety and mandatory health insurance  d set standards and requirements for fire safety and general emergency preparedness  e regulate the proper use  storage and disposal of waste  insecticides and other hazardous materials  f establish general requirements or restrictions on advertising containing false or misleading claims  or health and nutrient claims on menus or otherwise  such as low calorie  healthy or organic  g establish requirements concerning withholdings and employee reporting of taxes on tips and h regulate or ban the use of polystyrene cups 
in order to develop and construct more stores  we or our franchisees need to comply with applicable zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date  but expansion of our menu offerings or more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new stores 
we and our franchisees are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the us americans with disabilities act  which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability 
we may  in the future  have to modify stores  for example  by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures  to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons 
while these expenses could be material  our current expectation is that any such action will not require us to expend substantial funds 
we are subject to the us fair labor standards act  the us immigration reform and control act of and various federal and state laws governing various matters including minimum wages  overtime meal and rest periods  accommodations to certain employees  and other working conditions 
complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non compliance 
in addition  we pay a significant number of our hourly staff at rates consistent with  but higher than  the applicable federal or state minimum wage 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage would increase our labor cost 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to our current and any future franchise operations 
see risk factors governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we are also subject to various federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor licensee relationships 
many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement  including the duration and scope of non competition provisions  the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply 
the federal trade commission  or the ftc  and some state laws also require that the franchisor furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document that contains prescribed information and  in some instances  require the franchisor to register the franchise offering 
environmental matters 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the use of polystyrene products  and several counties in which our stores are located have already banned the use of our polystyrene cups 
during  we continued to make progress on certain eco sustainability initiatives first launched in  focusing on phasing out the use of polystyrene cups  as well as increasing the use of recyclable products  and reducing waste 
our new double walled paper cup is scheduled to be in use by the summer of  and will replace our use of polystyrene cups in the us our other green initiatives include the use of more environmentally friendly packaging for our cup carriers  oatmeal cups and lids  breakfast clear cups and lids  spoons and napkins  all of which are made from recycled material 
we have also reduced the amount of corrugated cardboard used for bulk shipping  reduced labeling requirements  and reduced freight  resulting in lower fuel emissions 
our efforts have also resulted in the launch of several optimization programs to reduce waste  such as participation in recycling programs  as well as composting programs of our food waste where it is feasible for us to do so 
trademarks and domain names the company owns and or has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the united states and in other jurisdictions covering additional countries throughout the world 
some of the company s trademarks  including jamba juice and the jamba logo are of material importance to the company 
the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country 
however  trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and or their registrations are properly maintained 
in addition  the company has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names  including jamba 
com and jambajuice 
com 
management information systems each company store has computerized point of sale registers which collect transaction data used to generate pertinent information  including sales transactions and product mix 
additionally  the point of sale system is used to authorize  batch and settle credit card data 
all product prices are programmed into the point of sale register from the company s corporate office 
franchise stores generally use the same point of sale registers as company stores  but may elect to use alternative systems provided company approval and certain information is shared with the company 
franchisees set their own menu prices 
company stores use the company s licensed labor management software to record employee time clock information  schedule labor  and provide management reports 
company stores and many franchise stores use the company s licensed food cost management software to improve inventory management and provide management reports 
our continued focus on technological and procedural enhancements  in areas such as labor and inventory management  has relieved our store managers from manual administrative tasks and enables them to better focus on delivering exceptional customer service 
seasonality our business is subject to day to day volatility based on weather and varies by season 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is realized during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year  which include the summer months 
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  which encompasses the winter months and the holiday season  has traditionally been our lowest revenue volume quarter 
our business will likely continue to be subject to seasonal patterns for the foreseeable future  given that the largest portion of our sales continues to be from the sale of smoothies during the warmer parts of the year 
because of the seasonality of the business  results for an individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be achieved for the full fiscal year

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
if any of the risks and uncertainties described below actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the risk factors listed below  however  are not exhaustive 
other sections of this annual report on form k include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
risks related to our business we may not be successful in implementing our strategic priorities  which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
in fiscal we implemented our strategic priorities under our blend plan  which we believed necessary to support the company s continued growth and long term stockholder value 
on january   we announced our strategic priorities under the blend plan  which we believe continues jamba s path to a healthy  active lifestyle brand and creates long term shareholder value  including brand building and total innovation  lifestyle engagement  expand growth initiatives  new products  partners  channels and markets  and drive enterprise efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully implement these strategic priorities or whether these strategic priorities will be successful  and a failure of either could impede our growth and operating results 
we have a history of net losses and may incur losses in the future 
we have incurred net losses in five of the last six fiscal years 
we may continue to incur net losses in the future and we cannot assure you that we will sustain profitability 
a worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in consumer spending may substantially decrease our revenues and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
to a significant extent  our success depends on discretionary consumer spending  which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income 
while there are signs that conditions may be improving  there is no certainty that this trend will continue or that credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not deteriorate again 
accordingly  we may experience declines in revenue during economic turmoil or during periods of uncertainty 
any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending  leading cost conscious consumers to be more selective in restaurants visited  could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results of operations  business and financial condition 
the challenges of competing with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins 
we compete with many well established companies  food service and otherwise  on the basis of taste  quality and price of product offered  customer service  atmosphere  location and overall consumer experience 
our success depends  in part  upon the popularity of our products and our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all four day parts 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our products  our inability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all day parts  or changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business 
we compete with other smoothie and juice bar retailers  specialty coffee retailers  yogurt and ice cream shops  bagel shops  fast food restaurants  delicatessens  caf s  take out food service companies  supermarkets and convenience stores 
our competitors change with each of the four day parts  ranging from coffee bars and bakery caf s to casual dining chains 
many of our competitors or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do  which may allow them to react to changes in the market quicker than we can 
in addition  aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets  could reduce our revenue and operating margins 
we are subject to risks associated with climate change and climate change regulation 
laws and regulations regarding climate change  energy usage and emissions controls may impact the company directly through higher cost of goods 
the potential impacts of climate change and climate change regulations are highly uncertain at this time  and the company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as a result of climate change and climate change regulations 
our revenue is subject to volatility based on weather and varies by season 
seasonal factors cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
because the majority of our revenue results from the sale of smoothies  our revenue is typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people choose cold beverages and higher during the spring  summer and fall months for the opposite reason 
fluctuations in various food and supply costs  particularly fruit and dairy  could adversely affect our operating results 
supplies and prices of the various products that we use to prepare our offerings can be affected by a variety of factors  such as weather  seasonal fluctuations  demand  politics and economics in the producing countries 
these factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies  which could adversely affect our revenue and profits 
in addition  the prices of fruit and dairy  which are the main products in our offerings  can be highly volatile 
the quality of fruit we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis  depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase 
an increase in pricing of any fruit that we use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability 
in addition  higher diesel and gasoline prices may affect our supply or transportation costs and may affect our profitability 
although we attempt to mitigate the risks of volatile commodity prices and allow greater predictability in pricing by entering into fixed price or to be fixed priced purchase commitments for a portion of our fruit and dairy requirements  we cannot assure you that these activities will be successful or that they will not result in our paying substantially more for our fruit supply than would have been required absent such activities 
declines in sales may also adversely affect our business to the extent we have long term purchase commitments in excess of our needs 
we are dependent upon a limited number of distributors for a significant amount of our food distribution for our stores 
for company stores  we maintain food distribution contracts primarily with one distributor  systems services of america ssa  and a majority of franchise stores are serviced by the sygma network  inc sygma although we believe our relationships with these distributors will result in increased operation efficiencies and cost savings  we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that we will not have to pay substantially more for distributor services in the event ssa or sygma have operational problems 
should either distributor have operational problems  our operations could be adversely affected 
we may face difficulties entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or new service providers 
if we expand our operations into new geographic areas through new company stores  franchise stores and or the jambago platform  or introduce new products with special manufacture  storage or distribution requirements  we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers or enter into new arrangements with existing ones 
we may also encounter difficulties or be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms as favorable as those we currently enjoy  which could harm our business and operating results 
for example  the potential growth in smaller format stores may cause the frequency of shipments to increase and the average number of cases per shipment to decrease  thereby increasing the company s per case shipment costs 
the company s success depends on the value of the jamba juice and jamba brands 
the jamba juice brand practice is to inspire and simplify healthy living 
we believe we must preserve and grow the value of the jamba juice brand in order to be successful in building our business and particularly in building a consumer products growth platform primarily under the jamba brand 
brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions  and the jamba juice brand has been highly rated in several recent brand studies 
we intend to reinforce and extend these perceptions for the jamba brand to help support our licensing efforts 
our brand building initiatives involve increasing our product offerings  opening new franchise stores  expanding the jambago and jamba smoothie station platforms and entering into licensing arrangements to increase awareness of our brands and create and maintain brand loyalty 
our licensees are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages  food and other products directly to customers 
we provide training and support to  and monitor the operations of  these business partners  but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control  including financial pressures 
we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us 
any shortcoming of one of our business partners  particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience or the safety of beverages or food  may be attributed by customers to us  thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations 
if our brand building initiatives are unsuccessful  or if business incidents occur which erode consumer perceptions of our brand  then the value of our products may diminish and we may not be able to implement our business strategy 
we may experience higher than anticipated costs in connection with the refresh and remodel of existing stores 
updating the format and design of our stores is important to maintaining a positive consumer association with the jamba juice brand 
while we intend for such remodeling efforts to inure to the benefit of the company  the associated costs may be higher than expected  and our revenues and expenses could be negatively impacted 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 
our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business 
our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to build further brand recognition using our trademarks  service marks  trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property  including our name and logos and the unique ambiance of our stores  both domestically and overseas 
we have secured the ownership and rights to our marks in the united states and have filed or obtained registrations in select classes including restaurant services in most other significant foreign jurisdictions 
we undertake similar efforts to protect our brands in other relevant consumer product categories in relevant jurisdictions 
if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate  or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property  the value of our store brand and our consumer products brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we have not encountered claims from prior users of intellectual property relating to restaurant services in areas where we operate or intend to conduct material operations in the near future  there can be no assurances that we will not encounter such claims 
if so  this could harm our image  brands or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 
our business could be adversely affected by increased labor or healthcare costs 
self insurance plan claims could materially impact our results 
labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business 
we compete with other employers in our markets for hourly workers and may become subject to higher labor costs as a result of such competition 
we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our team members 
a considerable number of the team members employed by us are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
in  the federal minimum wage increased to per hour 
additionally  many of our company store team members work in stores located in states where the minimum wage is greater than the federal minimum wage and receive compensation equal to the state s minimum wage 
the current california minimum wage is per hour 
moreover  municipalities may set minimum wages above the applicable state standards  such as in san francisco  which raised the minimum wage to per hour as of january  any further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases where our employees may be located will increase our labor costs 
competition for employees in various markets could also result in higher required wage rates 
furthermore  the company is self insured for employee healthcare and dental benefits 
the company pays a substantial part of the healthcare benefits for team members at the general manager level and above and for those working at the company s corporate office 
liabilities associated with the risks that the company retains are estimated in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities are based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as the company s actual historical trends 
if actual claims experience differs from the company s assumptions  historical trends  and estimates  changes in the company s insurance reserves could materially impact our results of operations 
the patient protection and affordable care act enacted in  as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by congress and state legislatures  may have a material adverse impact on our business 
we are currently evaluating the potential effects of the patient protection and affordable care act on our business 
while the costs of such legislation will occur after  due to provisions requiring phasing in over time  changes to our healthcare costs structure could have a significant  negative impact on our future business 
we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long term non cancelable leases 
we and our franchisees compete for real estate and our or their inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact our respective abilities to grow 
our leases generally have initial terms of between five and years  and generally can be extended only in five year increments if at all 
we generally cannot cancel these leases 
if an existing or new store is not profitable  and we decide to close it  as we have done in the past and may do in the future  we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including  among other things  paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term 
additionally  because we sublease the premises of company stores sold to franchisees in our refranchising program  we are still legally liable to the landlords under the prime leases  and we will need to assume obligations under the prime lease should a franchisee default on its sublease obligations 
current locations of our stores and franchised locations may become unattractive as demographic patterns change 
in addition  as each of our leases expire  we may fail to negotiate renewals  either on commercially acceptable terms or at all  which could require us to close stores in desirable locations 
our business and results may be subject to disruption from work stoppages  terrorism or natural disasters 
our operations may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  acts of war  terrorism  pandemics  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
these disruptions can result in  among other things  lost sales when consumers stay home or are physically prevented from reaching our stores  property damage  lost sales when our stores are forced to close for extended periods of time and interruptions in supply when vendors suffer damages or transportation is affected 
in addition  our corporate offices and support center is located in northern california near known earthquake fault lines 
if a major earthquake or other natural disaster were to occur in northern california  our corporate offices and support center may be damaged or destroyed 
such a disruption could result in the temporary or permanent loss of critical data  suspension of operations  delays in shipments of product  and disruption of business in both the affected region and nationwide  which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
the unexpected loss of one or more members of our executive management team could adversely affect our business 
our success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive management team and other key employees 
we believe that these individuals understand our operational strategies and priorities and the steps necessary to drive our long term growth and stockholder value 
competition for personnel in our industry is strong and the ability to retain key employees during a revitalization effort can be difficult 
while we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers  we cannot make any assurances that we can retain these individuals for the period necessary for us to achieve and sustain profitability 
our failure to continue to recruit  retain  and motivate executive management and other key employees sufficient to maintain a competitive position within our industry and to implement our strategic priorities would adversely affect our results of operations 
we are highly dependent on the financial performance of stores concentrated in certain geographic areas 
our financial performance is highly dependent on stores located in california 
stores located in california comprise over of company stores and generate a significant portion of our company store revenue 
these stores also comprise over of our total system stores 
in recent years  california and other states have experienced significant negative economic impact due to the current economic climate 
if geographic regions in which we have a high concentration of stores continue to experience significant economic pressures  our sales and operating results could be negatively impacted 
in addition  state and local laws  government regulations  weather conditions and natural disasters affecting california and other regions where we have a high concentration of stores may have a material impact upon our operating results 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic investments 
we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic investments 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions 
any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any or all of our acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments  or we may not realize them in the time frame expected 
future acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments may require us to issue additional equity securities  spend a substantial portion of our available cash  or incur debt or liabilities  amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur write offs of goodwill  which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders 
governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we and our franchisees are subject to various federal  state and local regulations 
each of our stores is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health  sanitation  food and workplace safety and other agencies 
we and our franchisees may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new stores  which could delay planned store openings 
in addition  stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations 
our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the us americans with disabilities act  family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters 
in recent years  there has been an increased legislative  regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry 
establishments operating in the quick service and fast casual segments have been a particular focus  and compliance with additional regulations can become costly and affect our operating results 
our federal  state and local tax returns may  from time to time  be selected for audit by the taxing authorities  which may result in tax assessments  interest or penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we are subject to federal  state and local taxes in the us in making tax estimates and paying taxes  significant judgment is often required 
although we believe our tax positions and estimates are reasonable  if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company  we could have an additional tax liability  including interest and penalties 
if material  payment of such additional amounts could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we rely heavily on information technology and a material failure of that technology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business 
our business operations rely heavily on information systems  including point of sale processing in our stores  management of our supply chain and distribution system  vendor and franchisee invoicing  and various other processes and procedures 
the efficient management of our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems  and any related failure and or breach of security could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations 
significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems 
failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of customers  vendors or employees could expose us to data loss  litigation and liability  and our reputation could be significantly harmed 
our business operations might require us to process and or maintain certain personal  business and financial information about customers  vendors and employees 
the use of such information by us is regulated by federal  state and foreign laws  as well as certain third party agreements 
if our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations  and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately  it could adversely affect our reputation and result in litigation and settlement costs  damage awards  or penalties and fines 
as privacy and information security law and regulations change  we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance 
a failure or breach of our security systems or infrastructure as a result of cyber attacks could disrupt our business  result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information  damage our reputation  increase our costs and cause losses 
information security risks have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies  the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions  and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime  hackers  terrorists and other external parties 
these threats may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties  or may result from human error or accidental technological failure 
these threats include cyber attacks such as computer viruses  malicious code  phishing attacks or information security breaches 
to date  we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches 
any actual attacks could lead to damage to our reputation  additional costs such as repairing systems and investigation or compliance costs  penalties  financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities 
if such attacks are not detected immediately  their effect could be compounded 
as cyber threats continue to evolve  we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 
any of the risks described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and results of operations 
risks related to our franchise business our growth strategy depends on increasing franchise ownership 
because our current growth strategy is to emphasize franchise store development  we receive an increasingly significant amount of our revenues in the form of royalties from our franchisees 
accordingly  the success of our business is increasingly dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees 
this strategy is subject to risks and uncertainties 
while our franchise agreements set forth certain operational standards and guidelines  we have limited control over how our franchisees businesses are run  and any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments 
we may not be able to identify franchisee candidates with appropriate experience and financial resources or to negotiate mutually acceptable agreements with those that do 
our franchisee candidates may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the stores contemplated by their franchise agreements with us 
in addition  franchisees may not be able to find suitable sites on which to develop new stores or negotiate acceptable lease terms for the sites  obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules 
if our franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt  it could result in financial distress or even possible insolvency or bankruptcy 
some of our franchisees experienced financial pressures during fiscal if a significant number of our franchisees become financially distressed  this could harm our operating results through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 
expansion into new geographic markets may present increased risks 
franchise growth is planned in new geographic areas in the united states and select international markets for fiscal our future results  and the results of new franchise stores  depend on various factors  including successful selection and expansion into these new geographic markets and market acceptance of the jamba juice experience 
those markets may have different competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns as compared to existing markets 
as a result  those new stores may be less successful than stores in our existing markets 
consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the jamba juice brand  and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned 
franchisees may find it more difficult in new markets to hire  motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision  passion and culture 
stores opened in new markets may also have lower average store revenue than stores opened in existing markets  and may have higher construction  occupancy or operating costs than stores in existing markets 
furthermore  we may have difficulty in finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us  either initially or over time  with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards 
revenue at stores opened in new markets may take longer to increase and reach expected revenue levels  and may never do so  thereby affecting our overall royalty income 
as with the experience of other retail food concepts that have tried to expand nationally and internationally  we may find that the jamba juice concept has limited appeal to customers in new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of the jamba juice experience 
newly opened stores may not succeed  future markets and stores may not be successful and  even if we are successful  our average store revenue  and the royalty income generated therefrom  may not increase and may even decline 
our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful and could impair the value of our brand 
our current strategy includes international expansion in a number of countries around the world 
expanding into international markets will expose us to new risks and uncertainties  including product supply  import export limitations and regulations to which we are not currently bound and may not be currently set up to handle  consumer preferences  occupancy costs  operating expenses and labor and infrastructure challenges 
if stores open in international markets and such stores are unable to source inventory locally  franchisees may be required to import inventory from our us distributors and any resulting import duties  tariffs  transportation or other charges may disproportionately impact such stores cost of goods which could harm the viability of such stores 
finally  international operations have inherent risks such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the application and effect of local laws and regulations and enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 
additionally  effectively managing growth can be challenging  particularly as we continue to expand into new international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals  philosophy and standards 
failure of our international expansion strategy could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
termination or non renewal of franchise agreements may disrupt store performance 
each franchise agreement is subject to termination by us in the event of default by the franchisee after the applicable cure period 
upon the expiration of the initial term of a franchise agreement  the franchisee generally has an option to renew for an additional term 
there is no assurance that franchisees will meet the criteria for renewal or will desire or be able to renew their franchise agreements 
if not renewed  a franchise agreement and payments required thereunder will terminate 
we may be unable to find a new franchisee to replace such lost revenue 
furthermore  while we will be entitled to terminate franchise agreements following a default that is not cured within the applicable cure period  if any  the disruption to the performance of the stores could materially and adversely affect our business 
our franchisees could take actions that harm our reputation and reduce our royalty revenue 
while we have franchise agreements in place with our franchisees that provide certain operational requirements  we do not exercise control over the day to day operations of our franchise stores 
any operational or development shortcomings of our franchise stores  including their failure to comply with applicable laws  are likely to be attributed to our system wide operations in the eyes of consumers and could adversely affect our reputation and have a direct negative impact on the royalty revenue we receive from those stores 
we could face liability from our franchisees and from government agencies 
a franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisor franchisee relationship 
various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we could be liable for damages to franchisees  fines or other penalties 
expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies may adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees 
risks related to the food service business litigation and publicity concerning food quality  health claims  and other issues can result in liabilities  increased expenses  distraction of management  and can also cause customers to avoid our products  which could adversely affect our results of operations  business and financial condition 
food service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from food quality  health claims  allergens  illness  injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one retail location or a number of retail locations 
adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us  regardless of whether the allegations are true  by discouraging customers from buying our products 
our customers occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our stores  or that we have problems with food quality or operations 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  including false advertising claims  personal injury claims  contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination and similar matters  and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future 
regardless of whether any claims against us are valid  or whether we are ultimately held liable  claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance 
a judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage  or for which we are not covered by insurance  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects  which in turn could adversely affect our results 
in addition  the food services industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell  and disclosure and advertising practices 
we may also be subject to this type of proceeding in the future and  even if not  publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fast casual segments of the industry may harm our reputation or prospects and adversely affect our results 
we are also impacted by trends in litigation  including class action allegations brought under various consumer protection and employment laws  including wage and hour laws 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings  these proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial resources to defend our company and could affect the future premiums we would be required to pay on our insurance policies 
further  changes in governmental regulations could have adverse effects on our business and subject us to additional regulatory actions 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses could harm our customers  result in negative publicity and cause the temporary closure of some stores and  in some cases  could adversely affect the price and availability of fruits and vegetables  any of which could harm our brand reputation  result in a decline in revenue or an increase in costs 
we consider food safety a top priority and dedicate substantial resources toward ensuring that our customers enjoy high quality  safe and wholesome products 
however  we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food borne illnesses 
furthermore  our reliance on third party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food borne illness incidents such as e 
coli  hepatitis a  salmonella or listeria could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations 
instances of food borne illnesses  whether real or perceived  and whether at our stores or those of our competitors  could harm customers and otherwise result in negative publicity about us or the products we serve  which could adversely affect revenue 
if there is an incident involving our stores serving contaminated products  our customers may be harmed  our revenue may decrease and our brand name and reputation may be impaired 
if our customers become ill from food borne illnesses  we could be forced to temporarily close some stores 
in addition  we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of making any such changes and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses and injuries caused by food contamination have in the past  and could in the future  adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences  particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers 
as a result  our costs may increase and our revenue may decline 
a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity  or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our stores  could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
bans on the use of polystyrene products can negatively impact our operating results 
we are subject to regulations regarding the use of polystyrene products  and several counties in which our stores are located have already banned the use of our polystyrene cups 
as more state and local governments take similar actions  we may be subject to further bans on the use of polystyrene cups 
although our new double walled paper cup is scheduled to be in use by summer of and is intended to replace our use of polystyrene cups system wide  a national ban on the use of polystyrene cups could potentially increase our costs and create customer satisfaction issues that could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to ownership of common stock failure of the company s internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
internal control over financial reporting includes i maintaining reasonably detailed records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  and ii providing reasonable assurance that we a record transactions as necessary to prepare the financial statements  b make receipts and expenditures in accordance with management authorizations  and c would timely prevent or detect any unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud 
any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
a significant financial reporting failure could cause an immediate loss of investor confidence in us and a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
our anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
for example  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill  which would make it difficult for someone to acquire the company without the approval of the board of directors 
also  the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include other anti takeover provisions such as limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend our charter documents  including stockholder supermajority voting requirements  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting absent the request of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock  and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals 
the company is also afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law which prevents it from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least of its common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock  unless board of directors or stockholder approval is obtained 
our stock price may fluctuate significantly 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile 
our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
broad market factors  including the effect of international political instability  armed conflict  natural disasters  financial markets  and general economic conditions  may have a material adverse effect on our stock price  regardless of our actual performance
