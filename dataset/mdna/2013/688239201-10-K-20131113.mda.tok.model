all estimates referred to in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to the company s estimates as of november  executive overview fiscal was a strong year for the company  one that the company believes demonstrated the power of the company move strategy 
despite slightly lower revenues as a result of a decline in defense segment sales  the company recorded higher earnings and grew revenues in each of its non defense segments and operating income margins in all of its segments 
full year earnings from continuing operations of per share were per share above the high end of the company s fiscal estimate of per share that the company conveyed at its september analyst day 
full year earnings included per share in costs related to an unsolicited tender offer for the company common stock and a threatened proxy contest  a per share non cash impairment charge and a per share charge related to the ratification of a five year union contract extension in the defense segment  that were not included in the september analyst day estimate range 
the company also generated operating cash flows of million and returned million of capital to the company s shareholders through share repurchases 
consolidated net sales decreased million  or  to billion in fiscal compared to fiscal replacement driven demand in the access equipment segment  coupled with a slow economic recovery in the united states  resulted in a 
table of contents significant increase in sales in the company non defense segments in fiscal compared to fiscal however  the increase in sales in the company non defense segments was not enough to overcome the decrease in defense sales  which the company expected as us defense spending for tactical wheeled vehicles has declined 
while sales were lower  consolidated operating income in fiscal increased  to million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in consolidated operating income was largely attributable to the gross profit associated with higher sales in the company non defense segments  improved performance in the company non defense segments as a result of operational and processes improvements and price realization  along with higher margins in the defense segment associated with international sales and improved operational efficiencies 
the company continued to invest in new products  processes and systems to further the company move strategy during fiscal operating income in fiscal included costs of million incurred by the company in connection with an unsolicited tender offer for the company common stock and a threatened proxy contest  a non cash intangible asset impairment charge in the access equipment segment of million and charges of million related to the ratification of a five year union contract extension in the defense segment 
operating income in fiscal included costs incurred by the company in connection with a proxy contest of million 
during fiscal  the defense segment rightsized its production and salaried workforces consistent with substantially reduced dod demand 
the defense segment also delivered light combat all terrain vehicle l atv test vehicles to the dod under the joint light tactical vehicle jltv engineering  manufacturing development emd contract 
the company vehicles  along with vehicles from two other competitors  are currently undergoing months of testing to be completed in fiscal finally  the defense segment secured orders for mrap all terrain vehicles m atvs from the kingdom of saudi arabia 
the company expects consolidated sales will decrease between and in fiscal compared to fiscal  resulting in consolidated sales of between billion and billion 
this estimate assumes higher sales in the company non defense segments as a result of the expected continued economic recovery around the world coupled with an approximate decline in defense segment sales 
the company expects consolidated operating income will be in the range of million to million leading to earnings per share of approximately to as a result of the company strong financial performance in fiscal  execution of the company move strategy and positive outlook  the company has reinstated payment of a quarterly cash dividend by declaring a dividend of per share payable december  to shareholders of record on november  move strategy in fiscal  the company completed a comprehensive strategic planning process to  among other things  assess the outlook for each of its markets  consider strategic alternatives and develop strategic initiatives to address the current difficult market forces then facing the company 
those difficult market forces involved non defense markets  which were down to more than from peak  an uncertain economic recovery and a likely sharp downturn in us defense spending beginning in the study culminated in the creation of the company s planned roadmap to deliver superior long term earnings growth and increased shareholder value over the next business cycle and beyond 
the company s roadmap  named move  entails aggressive cost reduction and prudent organic growth initiatives until a market recovery provides an opportunity for both significant earnings leverage and cash flow at which time the company strategic options could expand 
the move strategy consists of four key strategic initiatives market recovery and growth the company plans to capture or improve its historical share of a market recovery 
the company estimated in september that even a modest market recovery represents a million operating income opportunity in its non defense businesses between fiscal and fiscal at historical margins and assuming no major market share gains 
the company believes that the recovery in certain of its non defense markets began in fiscal in fiscal  the company experienced continued improvement in the north american access equipment market and in the us concrete mixer market 
in addition  quoting activity and orders for fire apparatus increased late in fiscal the european and australian access equipment markets underperformed expectations in fiscal and the company currently believes that this initiative is on pace to finish below the fiscal target of million incremental operating income  due to expected weaker recovery in certain markets compared to its september estimates 
optimize cost and capital structure the company is executing plans to optimize its cost and capital structure o initiative to provide value for customers and shareholders by aggressively attacking its product  process and overhead costs 
the company has targeted basis points of operating income improvement between fiscal and through this initiative 
the company made good progress on the company s o initiative in fiscal  which contributed to a basis point increase in operating income margins in the company largest segment  access equipment 
the company expects to exceed its fiscal consolidated operating income margin improvement target of basis 
table of contents points 
the company expects that the actions implemented in fiscal for this initiative will result in approximately basis points of the basis point operating income margin improvement that had been targeted for fiscal the company is also executing a prudent capital allocation strategy  which the company expects to incrementally benefit earnings as well as returns for shareholders 
as part of this strategy  the company repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock during fiscal at an aggregate cost of million 
earnings per share in fiscal improved compared to the prior year as a result of lower average shares outstanding 
subsequent to the end of its fiscal year  the company announced as part of its capital allocation strategy that it was reinstating a quarterly cash dividend by declaring a dividend of per share payable on december  to shareholders of record on november  value innovation the company has maintained its emphasis on new product development as it seeks to expand sales and margins by leading its core markets in the introduction of new or improved products and new technologies 
the company has targeted this initiative to achieve million of incremental annual revenue by fiscal compared to fiscal the company s value innovation initiative did not meet the company s target for incremental revenue from new products in fiscal the company made engineering management changes mid year  re allocated resources and made structural changes to the company s product development stage gate review process to bring this initiative back on track 
the company expects that its countermeasures will drive incremental new product launches in fiscal and and expects this initiative to be back on target by fiscal emerging market expansion the company is driving expansion in targeted international geographies where it believes that there are significant opportunities for growth 
the company target is to derive more than of its revenues from outside the us by fiscal the company achieved its fiscal target for international sales 
the company has continued to invest in international business development resources and believes it is on track to achieving its fiscal target 
the company believes the successful execution of its move strategy significantly contributed to the company strong financial results in fiscal the company raised its fiscal performance outlook several times during fiscal and ultimately exceeded the high end of the company s fiscal estimate of per share that the company conveyed at its september analyst day by per share 
by focusing on its move strategy  the company believes that  in the aggregate  it is on track to achieve its fiscal targeted earnings per share range of to  while the company is executing countermeasures to drive certain initiatives that are behind schedule to become back on target

fiscal outlook the company believes consolidated net sales will decrease to in fiscal compared to fiscal  resulting in consolidated sales of between billion and billion 
this estimate assumes higher sales in the company non defense segments  as a result of the expected continued economic recovery around the world  coupled with an approximate decline in defense segment sales 
the company expects consolidated operating income will be in the range of million to million leading to earnings per share of approximately to the company believes access equipment segment sales will be between billion and billion in fiscal  representing an increase of to as compared to fiscal the company expects the sales increase will be a result of improving international sales and continued strong sales in north america  led by ongoing fleet replacement and the continued return of independent rental companies to the market  offset in part by lower military telehandler sales 
this estimate assumes that a meaningful recovery in north american non residential construction will not occur until fiscal the company expects operating income margins in the access equipment segment will be between and  compared to a margin of in fiscal  reflecting the benefit of expected higher sales and the continued impact of move initiatives 
the company expects that defense segment sales will be between billion and billion in fiscal  a decrease of approximately from fiscal sales 
this estimate is within the sales range that the company discussed at the company s analyst day in september the company believes operating income margins in the defense segment will be between and 
this estimate is above the baseline operating income margins estimated by the company in september the company expects fire emergency segment sales will be between million and million in fiscal  reflecting the slow recovery in the municipal fire market that the company has recently begun to experience 
the company expects operating income margins in this segment to increase to between and in fiscal as a result of its optimizing cost move initiative beginning to take hold in this segment 
the company believes commercial segment sales will be in the range of million to million in fiscal  an to improvement over fiscal  largely driven by an expected continued strong recovery in the us concrete mixer market and expected improvement in the refuse collection vehicle market in the americas 
the company expects operating income margins in this segment to be between and in fiscal  reflecting the benefits of higher sales and the impact of other move initiatives 
the company expects corporate expenses in fiscal will be approximately million as the company continues to invest in information technology initiatives and the company s oshkosh operating system

the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately million in fiscal  higher than the last several years as the company invests to further support its initiatives 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on equipment and parts sales when contract terms are met  collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
appropriate provisions are made for discounts  returns and sales allowances 
sales are recorded net of amounts invoiced for taxes imposed on the customer such as excise or value added taxes 

table of contents sales to the us government of non commercial products manufactured to the government s specifications are recognized using the units of delivery measure under the percentage of completion accounting method as units are accepted by the government 
under the units of delivery measure  the company records sales as units are accepted by the dod based on unit sales values stated in the respective contracts 
costs of sales are based on actual costs incurred to produce the units delivered under the contract 
the company includes amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the company charges anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress to earnings when identified 
approximately of the company s revenues for fiscal were recognized under the percentage of completion accounting method 
the company accounts for certain equipment lease contracts as sales type leases 
the present value of all payments  net of executory costs such as legal fees  is recorded as revenue  the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales  certain profit is deferred in accordance with lease accounting rules and interest income is recognized over the terms of the leases using the effective interest method 
the company enters into rental purchase guarantee agreements with some of its customers 
these agreements are normally for a term of no greater than twelve months and provide for rental payments with a guaranteed purchase at the end of the agreement 
at the inception of the agreement  the company records the full amount due under the agreement as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales 
sales incentives 
the terms for sales transactions with some of the company s distributors and customers may include specific volume based incentives  which are calculated and paid or credited on account as a percentage of actual sales 
the company accounts for these incentives as sales discounts at the time of revenue recognition  which are recorded as a direct reduction of sales 
the company reviews its accrual for sales incentives on a quarterly basis and any adjustments are reflected in current earnings 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of the company reporting units  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions 
the company performs its annual review at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
see critical accounting estimates 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the fair value of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or  under certain circumstances  a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business 
when the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  a further analysis is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
impairment losses  limited to the carrying value of goodwill  represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite lived trade names based upon a relief from royalty method 
this methodology determines the fair value of each trade name through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular trade name 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers projected future sales  a fair market royalty rate for each applicable trade name and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
during fiscal  the company recognized an impairment of a trade name in the access equipment segment of million 
impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets 
the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
the company enters into agreements with finance companies whereby the company will guarantee the indebtedness of third party end users to whom the finance company lends to purchase the company s equipment 
in some instances  the company retains an obligation to the finance companies in the event the customer defaults on the financing 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification 
table of contents asc topic  guarantees  the company recognizes the greater of the fair value of the guarantee or the contingent liability required by fasb asc topic  contingencies 
reserves are initially established related to these guarantees at the fair value of the guarantee based upon the company s understanding of the current financial position of the underlying customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the company becomes aware of deterioration in the financial condition of the customer borrower or of any impairment of the customer borrower s ability to make payments  additional allowances are considered 
although the company may be liable for the entire amount of a customer borrower s financial obligation under guarantees  its losses would generally be mitigated by the value of any underlying collateral including financed equipment  the finance company s inability to provide clear title of foreclosed equipment to the company  loss pools established in accordance with the agreements and other conditions 
during periods of economic downturn  the value of the underlying collateral supporting these guarantees can decline sharply to further increase losses in the event of a customer borrower s default 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and updates its estimates 
management employs judgment in making its estimates but they are based on historical experience and currently available information and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that its judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented 
definitization of undefinitized contracts 
the company recognizes revenue on undefinitized contracts with the dod to the extent that it can reasonably and reliably estimate the expected final contract price and when collectability is reasonably assured 
undefinitized contracts are used when the company and the dod have not agreed upon all contract terms before the company begins performance under the contracts 
at september   the company had recorded million in revenue on contracts that remain undefinitized 
to the extent that contract definitization results in changes or adjustments to previously recognized revenues or estimated or incurred costs  including charges from subcontractors  the company records those adjustments as a change in estimate in the period of change 
the company updated its estimated costs under several undefinitized change orders and recorded million and million of revenue related to such updates during fiscal and  respectively 
as the majority of costs associated with these contracts had previously been expensed  the definitization of contracts increased net income by million  or per share  and million  or per share  for fiscal and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s trade receivables are recorded 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additional reserves are established based upon the company s perception of the quality of the current receivables  including the length of time the receivables are past due  past experience of collectability and underlying economic conditions 
at september   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm value 
in valuing inventory  the company is required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items 
these assumptions require the company to analyze the aging of and forecasted demand for its inventory  forecast future product sales prices  pricing trends and margins  and to make judgments and estimates regarding obsolete or excess inventory 
future product sales prices  pricing trends and margins are based on the best available information at that time including actual orders received  negotiations with customers for future orders  including their plans for expenditures  and market trends for similar products 
the company judgments and estimates for excess or obsolete inventory are based on analysis of actual and forecasted usage 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires the company to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations 
table of contents for future events is involved 
future events that could significantly influence our judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where the company products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  actions of the company competitors  including the introduction of new products and technological advances 
the company makes adjustments to its inventory reserves based on the identification of specific situations and increases its inventory reserves accordingly 
at september   reserves for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 
goodwill 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the estimate of the fair value of the reporting units is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows and a market approach 
in estimating the fair value  management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as the company performance and profitability under existing contracts  its success in securing future business  the appropriate risk adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows  and terminal value growth and earnings rates 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the rate used to discount estimated cash flows is a rate corresponding to the company s cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate  and is dependent upon interest rates at a point in time 
to assess the reasonableness of the discounted projected cash flows  the company compares the sum of its reporting units fair value to the company market capitalization and calculates an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization 
the reasonableness of this control premium is evaluated by comparing it to control premiums for recent comparable market transactions 
consistent with prior years  the company weighted the income approach more heavily as the income approach uses long term estimates that consider the expected operating profit of each reporting unit during periods where residential and non residential construction and other macroeconomic indicators are nearer historical averages 
the company believes the income approach more accurately considers the expected recovery in the us and european construction markets than the market approach 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner to cause further impairment of goodwill  which could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company completed the required goodwill impairment test as of july  the company identified no indicators of goodwill impairment in the test performed as of july  in order to evaluate the sensitivity of any quantitative fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of any reporting unit was calculated 
this hypothetical decrease would still result in excess fair value over carrying value for the reporting units as of july  approximately of the company s recorded goodwill and indefinite lived purchased intangibles are concentrated within the jlg reporting unit in the access equipment segment 
the impairment model assumes that the us economy and construction spending and hence access equipment demand will continue to slowly improve through fiscal assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are highly judgmental 
while the company currently believes that an impairment of intangible assets at jlg is unlikely  events and conditions that could result in the impairment of intangibles at jlg include a sharp decline in economic conditions  pricing pressure on jlg margins or other factors leading to reductions in expected long term sales or profitability at jlg 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
the reserve for guarantees of the indebtedness of others requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s guarantees are granted 
the company evaluates the reserve based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded in accordance with fasb asc topic  contingencies 
in most cases  the financing company is required to provide clear title to the equipment under the financing program 
the company considers the residual value of the equipment to reduce the amount of exposure 
residual values are estimated based upon recent auctions  used equipment sales and periodic studies performed by a third party 
additional reserves  based upon historical loss percentages  are established at the time of sale of the equipment based upon the requirement of fasb asc topic  guarantees 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
product liability 
due to the nature of the company s products  the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
a substantial portion of these claims and lawsuits involve the company s access equipment  concrete placement and refuse collection vehicle businesses  while such lawsuits in the company s defense and fire emergency businesses have historically been limited 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to 
table of contents reduce or eliminate risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retentions that vary by business segment and by year 
as of september   the company was generally self insured for future claims up to million per claim 
the company establishes product liability reserves for its self insured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and the company s ability to reasonably estimate such loss 
there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation 
the company makes estimates based on available information and the company s best judgment after consultation with appropriate experts 
the company periodically revises estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances 
the company also utilizes actuarial methodologies to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of the adverse development of claims over time 
warranty 
sales of the company s products generally carry typical explicit manufacturers warranties that extend from six months to five years  based on terms that are generally accepted in the company marketplaces 
selected components included in the company s end products such as engines  transmissions  tires  etc 
may include manufacturers warranties 
these manufacturers warranties are generally passed on to the end customer of the company s products and the customer would generally deal directly with the component manufacturer 
the company records provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at the time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
at times  warranty issues arise that are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company provides for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that from time to time additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts  labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns 
over the past five fiscal years  the company s warranty cost as a percentage of sales has ranged from of sales to of sales 
warranty costs tend to be higher shortly after new product introductions  especially those introductions involving new technologies  when field warranty campaigns may be necessary to correct or retrofit certain items 
accordingly  the company must make assumptions about the number and cost of anticipated field warranty campaigns 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the extent of pre production testing  the number of units involved and the extent of new features components included in new product models 
each quarter  the company reviews actual warranty claims experience to determine if there are any systemic defects that would require a field campaign 
also  based upon historical experience  warranty provision rates on new product introductions are established at higher than standard rates to reflect increased expected warranty costs associated with any new product introduction 
defined benefit plans 
the pension benefit obligation and related pension income are calculated in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
the company uses the services of independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
inherent in these valuations are economic assumptions  including the expected rate of return on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities may be settled  rates of increase of health care costs as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns  mortality and turnover 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions used are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gain and losses that exceed of the greater of the plan projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets are amortized to earnings over the shorter of the estimated future service period of the plan participants or the period until any anticipated final plan settlements 
the company determines the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the project benefit payout period 
the company long term rate of return on assets is based on consideration of historical and forward looking returns and the current asset allocation strategy 
actuarial valuations at september  used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected return on plan assets of 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the company annual pension expense by million 
a basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the company s annual pension expense by million 

table of contents income taxes 
the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets 
the company records a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount management expects to realize 
management considers  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes 
asc topic prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with asc topic is a two step process 
the first step is recognition  where the company evaluates whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than likelihood of being sustained  zero tax benefit is recorded 
for tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step  the company performs the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded 
the actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from the company s estimates 
in future periods  changes in facts and circumstances and new information may require the company to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions 
changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in results of operations and financial position in the period in which such changes occur 
as of september   the company had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling million 
new accounting standards refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards on the company s consolidated financial statements 
customers and backlog sales to the us government comprised approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales for this period 
a substantial majority of the company s net sales are derived from customer orders prior to commencing production 
the company s backlog as of september  decreased to billion compared to billion at september  primarily due to a significant decline in defense segment backlog as a result of the slowdown in dod spending 
access equipment segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  the company believes that the increase in access equipment segment backlog is due in part to customers placing orders for delivery in the first quarter of fiscal in advance of an engine emissions standards change effective january   offset by a million decrease in military telehandler orders as work was completed on that contract in fiscal defense segment backlog decreased to billion at september  compared to billion at september  due largely to the fulfillment of fmtv orders and a lower dod budget for tactical wheeled vehicles 
fire emergency segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  due to improvement in the domestic fire apparatus market 
commercial segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  unit backlog for concrete mixers was down compared to september  the company believes this decline is the result of timing of large orders 
unit backlog for refuse collection vehicles was down at september  compared to september  reported backlog excludes purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed 
additionally  backlog excludes unfunded portions of the fhtv and fmtv contracts 
backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales or the ratio of the company s future sales to the dod versus its sales to other customers 
approximately of the company s september  backlog is not expected to be filled in fiscal 
table of contents financial market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk 
the company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us and off shore interest rates affect interest payable on the company s borrowings under its credit agreement 
based on debt outstanding at september   a basis point increase or decrease in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt would increase or decrease annual pre tax interest expense by approximately million 
the table below provides information about the company s debt obligations  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates dollars in millions expected maturity date thereafter total fair value liabilities long term debt variable rate us average interest rate fixed rate us average interest rate the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
commodity price risk 
the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel  aluminum and composites 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  rubber and others which are integrated into the company s end products 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company generally obtains firm quotations from its suppliers for a significant portion of its orders under firm  fixed price contracts in its defense segment 
in the company s access equipment  fire emergency and commercial segments  the company generally attempts to obtain firm pricing from most of its suppliers  consistent with backlog requirements and or forecasted annual sales 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 
foreign currency risk 
the company s operations consist of manufacturing in the us  belgium  canada  france  australia  romania and china and sales and limited vehicle body mounting activities on six continents 
in addition  the company manufactures products through an investment in a joint venture in mexico 
international sales comprised approximately of overall net sales in fiscal  of which approximately involved exports from the us the majority of export sales in fiscal were denominated in us dollars 
as a result of the manufacture and sale of the company s products in foreign markets  the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies in which certain of the company s transactions are denominated as compared to the value of the us dollar 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro and the uk pound sterling  changes between the uk dollar and the australian dollar  changes between the us dollar and the brazilian real and changes between the us dollar and the chinese renminbi 

table of contents the company enters into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the company s foreign currency exchange risk on monetary assets or liabilities 
these contracts qualify as derivative instruments under fasb asc topic  derivatives and hedging  however  the company has not designated all of these instruments as hedge transactions under asc topic accordingly  the mark to market impact of these derivatives is recorded each period to current earnings along with the offsetting foreign currency transaction gain loss recognized on the related balance sheet exposure 
at september   the company was managing million notional of foreign currency contracts  none of which were designated as accounting hedges and all of which settle within days 
the following table quantifies outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge non us dollar denominated cash  receivables and payables and the corresponding impact on the value of these instruments assuming a appreciation depreciation of the us dollar relative to all other currencies on september  dollars in millions foreign exchange gain loss from notional amount average contractual exchange rate fair value appreciation of us dollar depreciation of us dollar sell euro buy usd sell usd buy euro sell aud buy usd sell gbp buy euro sell euro buy sek sell usd buy gbp as previously noted  the company s policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for speculative purposes or the use of leveraged instruments 
it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would be offset by gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables
