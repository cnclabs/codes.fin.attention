item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table provides a summary of financial results  including information presented as a percentage of net sales in thousands for the fiscal years ended june  july  july  dollars percent dollars percent dollars percent net sales cost of goods sold restructuring charges gross profit engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges goodwill and tradename impairment income loss from operations interest expense other income  net income loss before income taxes provision credit for income taxes net income loss fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were billion  a decrease of million or when compared to the same period a year ago 
engines segment net sales for fiscal were billion  which was million or lower than the same period a year ago 
this decrease in net sales was primarily driven by reduced shipments of engines used on walk  ride and snow equipment in the north american market as well as lower sales to oem customers for the european and australasian markets 
shipments to european markets decreased due to macroeconomic issues and unfavorable weather conditions 
shipments to australasian markets decreased due to a significant lack of rainfall in highly populated areas 
in addition  sales were lower in fiscal due to an unfavorable mix of engines sold that reflected proportionately lower sales of large engines and unfavorable foreign exchange of million primarily related to the euro 
products segment net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from the same period a year ago 
approximately million of the net sales decrease resulted from our decision to exit the sale of lawn and garden equipment through national mass retailers 
the remaining decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes of snow equipment due to significantly below average snowfall in north america and reduced sales of lawn and garden equipment resulting from drought conditions in the united states and australasia 
the decrease in net sales was partially offset by higher shipments of portable and standby generators in the north american market 
gross profit percentage the consolidated gross profit percentage was in fiscal  up from in the same period last year 
included in consolidated gross profit were pre tax charges of million during fiscal related to previously announced restructuring actions to close the ostrava  czech republic and newbern  tennesee manufacturing facilities and the auburn  alabama plant consolidation 
the engines segment and products segment recorded million and million  respectively  of pre tax restructuring charges within gross profit during fiscal during fiscal  the engines segment and products segment recorded pre tax restructuring charges within gross profit of million and million  respectively

the company believes this information is meaningful to investors as it isolates the impact that restructuring charges have on gross profit and facilitates comparisons between reporting periods and peer companies 
while the company believes that adjusted gross profit is useful supplemental information  such adjusted results are not intended to replace our generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial results and should be read in conjunction with those gaap results 
the engines segment gross profit percentage for fiscal was  which was slightly higher than the in fiscal adjusted gross profit percentage for was  which was higher compared to fiscal the adjusted gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by due to lower manufacturing costs achieved through restructuring savings of million and start up costs incurred in fiscal associated with launching our phase iii emissions compliant engines 
partially offsetting this improvement was a reduction in engines built in fiscal  which reduced absorption of fixed manufacturing costs and lowered the adjusted gross profit percentage by 
lower material costs were mostly offset by reduced pricing  unfavorable foreign exchange and an unfavorable mix of engines sold 
the products segment gross profit percentage for fiscal was  which was higher than the in fiscal the products segment adjusted gross profit percentage for fiscal was  which was lower compared to the adjusted gross profit percentage for fiscal the adjusted gross profit percentage decreased by due to unfavorable absorption associated with a decrease in production volume 
the mcdonough  georgia manufacturing facility shutdown days increased by nearly six weeks in fiscal compared to last year 
this enabled the products segment to achieve a reduction in inventory levels despite the challenge of reduced sales volumes caused by lower market demand 
the unfavorable volume impact on gross profit percentage was partially offset by a benefit due to achieving restructuring cost savings of million and other efficiency improvements 
the addition of sales from the branco acquisition and favorable foreign exchange  primarily due to the australian dollar  also increased the gross margin percentage in fiscal engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million or from fiscal the engines segment engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  or million lower compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower compensation costs of million as a result of the previously announced reduction of of the global salaried workforce and reduced selling costs in response to the softness in the global markets  partially offset by million of increased pension expense compared to the same period last year 
the fiscal engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses include a million litigation settlement charge associated with a horsepower labeling case in canada 
the litigation charge is excluded from the engine segment adjusted income from operations 
the products segment engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal the decrease was attributable to lower compensation costs which include a million benefit from the previously announced global salaried employee reduction as well as reduced selling expenses in response to the softness in the global markets 
these reductions were partially offset by the addition of expenses related to the branco acquisition 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on a combination of factors  predominantly driven by a slower than anticipated recovery of the north america lawn and garden market  the company s forecasted cash flow estimates used in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets were adversely impacted 
as a result  the company concluded that the carrying value amounts of the products reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of june  the non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million 
in addition  the company concluded that the carrying value amounts of a tradename within the products reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of june  the non cash intangible asset impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million 
the impairment charge did not adversely affect the company s debt position  cash flow  liquidity or compliance with financial covenants under its revolving credit facility 
no impairment charges were recorded within the engines segment 
restructuring actions in fiscal  the company made progress against its previously announced restructuring actions 
the company closed the sale of its ostrava  czech republic manufacturing facility  has nearly completed all activities associated with exiting the newbern  tennessee manufacturing facility and continues to make progress towards moving horizontal engine manufacturing from its auburn  alabama plant to china

interest expense interest expense for fiscal was million  which was comparable to fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for the same period last year 
the increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a net benefit of million associated with restructuring charges incurred in connection with closing the company ostrava manufacturing facility  a net benefit of million due to the expiration of a non us statute of limitation period during fiscal  and an additional tax expense of million for a non cash goodwill impairment charge in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal were billion  a decrease of million  or when compared to fiscal engines segment net sales for fiscal were billion  which was lower by million or compared to fiscal this decrease in net sales was primarily driven by an reduction in shipment volumes of engines to oems for lawn and garden products in the north american and european markets due to drought conditions in north america and economic uncertainty in europe leading to reduced consumer purchases of lawn and garden equipment and unfavorable foreign exchange of million primarily related to the euro 
the decreases were partially offset by increased engine pricing  a favorable mix of product shipped that reflected proportionally larger volumes of units used on snow throwers and portable and standby generators 
products segment net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or from fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased shipments of portable and standby generators due to widespread power outages in the us as a result of landed hurricane irene and a subsequent snow storm on the united states east coast earlier in the fiscal year  increased shipments of snow equipment after channel inventories were depleted from the prior selling season  improved pricing  a favorable mix of lawn and garden sales through the dealer channel and favorable foreign exchange of million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced shipment volumes of riding lawn and garden equipment domestically and reduced volume in the international markets 
there were no landed hurricanes in fiscal gross profit the consolidated gross profit percentage was in fiscal  down from in fiscal included in consolidated gross profit were pre tax charges of million during fiscal related to previously announced restructuring actions to close the ostrava  czech republic and newbern  tennesee manufacturing facilities and the auburn  alabama plant consolidation 
the engines segment and products segment recorded million and million  respectively  for fiscal there were no pre tax restructuring charges included in gross profit for fiscal the engines segment gross profit percentage for fiscal was  lower from in fiscal excluding restructuring charges of million  adjusted gross profit percentage in fiscal was  a decrease of approximately basis points compared to fiscal the adjusted gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by due to reduced absorption on a reduction in production volumes  from unfavorable foreign exchange  and from higher manufacturing spending associated with rising commodity costs and start up costs of million associated with launching our phase iii emissions compliant engines 
these reductions were partially offset by a benefit due to improved engine pricing and a favorable mix of products sold 
the products segment gross profit percentage for fiscal was  up from in fiscal excluding restructuring charges of million  adjusted gross profit percentage in fiscal was  an increase of approximately basis points compared to fiscal the adjusted gross profit percentage improved by from increased pricing and a favorable mix of lawn and garden sales through the dealer channel  due to production operational improvements of million and resulted from improved absorption on higher production volumes 
this was offset by a decrease of due to increased commodity costs 
engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million or from fiscal the engines segment engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal primarily due to lower employee compensation expense and a planned reduction of spend in advertising costs and professional services in response to the softness in the global markets 
the products segment engineering  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal the increase was attributable to greater selling expense to support investments in international growth  higher employee compensation expense  and million higher bad debt expense recorded in fiscal primarily attributable to distributors in the european market 
restructuring actions in january  the company announced plans to reduce manufacturing capacity through closure of its newbern  tennessee and ostrava  czech republic plants as well as the reconfiguration of its plant in poplar bluff  missouri

the engines segment continues to support lawn and garden equipment oems who provide lawn and garden equipment to these retailers 
the products segment continues to focus on innovative  higher margin products that are sold through the company network of simplicity  snapper and ferris dealers and regional retailers 
the company also continues to sell pressure washers and portable and standby generators through the us mass retail channel 
interest expense for fiscal  interest expense was million lower compared to fiscal due to million of pre tax charges associated with the refinancing of senior notes in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal  as well as lower average outstanding borrowings at slightly higher weighted average interest rates in fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to reported for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a net benefit of million associated with restructuring charges incurred in connection with closing the company ostrava plant facility and a net benefit of million due to the expiration of a non us statute of limitation period during fiscal and the settlement of us audits 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal years  and net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal the improvement in operating cash flows was primarily related to lower working capital needs in fiscal associated with lower levels of accounts receivable and inventory compared to the prior year 
cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to a million reduction in the decrease in accounts receivable compared to fiscal  which was partly due to million of delayed funding under the company dealer inventory financing facility with ge capital commercial distribution finance implemented in fiscal  and cash contributions to the pension plan of million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these cash flows include capital expenditures of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively

generally  these would be subject to us tax if repatriated 
as of june   approximately million of the company million of cash and cash equivalents was held in non us subsidiaries 
future liquidity and capital resources in december  the company issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due december net proceeds were primarily used to redeem the remaining outstanding principal of the senior notes due march in october  the company entered into a million multicurrency credit agreement the revolver 
the revolver replaced the company previous amended and restated multicurrency credit agreement dated as of july  the revolver has a term of five years and all outstanding borrowings on the revolver are due and payable on october  the initial maximum availability under the revolving credit facility is million 
availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
the company may from time to time increase the maximum availability under the revolving credit facility by up to million if certain conditions are satisfied 
there were no borrowings under the revolver as of june  and july  in august  the company announced that its board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly dividend from per share to per share on its common stock  payable on or after october  to shareholders of record at the close of business on august  in august  the board of directors of briggs stratton authorized up to million in funds for use in a common share repurchase program with an original expiration of june  in august  the board of directors of briggs stratton authorized an additional million in funds associated with the common share repurchase program and an extension of the expiration date to june  the common share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of shares of the company common stock on the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions and certain governing loan covenants

on july   the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map act was signed into law 
the map act included certain pension related provisions which included changes to the methodology used to determine discount rates for erisa funding purposes for qualified defined benefit pension plans 
based on historical interest rates  the map act allows plan sponsors to utilize a higher discount rate to value pension liabilities  which results in lower required pension plan contributions under erisa 
based upon current regulations and actuarial studies  the company is required to make no minimum contributions to the qualified pension plan in fiscal or the company may be required to make further contributions in future years depending on the actual return on plan assets and the funded status of the plan in future periods 
management believes that available cash  cash generated from operations  existing lines of credit and access to debt markets will be adequate to fund the company s capital requirements and operational needs for the foreseeable future 
the revolver and the senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to pay dividends  repurchase shares  incur indebtedness  create liens  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  consolidate or merge with other entities  sell or lease all or substantially all of its assets  and dispose of assets or the proceeds of sales of its assets 
the revolver contains financial covenants that require the company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio and impose a maximum average leverage ratio 
as of june   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
financial strategy management believes that the value of the company is enhanced if the capital invested in operations yields a cash return that is greater than the cost of capital 
consequently  management s first priority is to reinvest capital into physical assets and products that maintain or grow the global cost leadership and market positions that the company has achieved  and drive the economic value of the company 
management s next financial objective is to identify strategic acquisitions or alliances that may enhance revenues and provide a higher economic return 
finally  management believes that when capital cannot be invested for returns greater than the cost of capital  the company should return capital to the capital providers through dividends and or share repurchases 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements and certain employee benefit plans 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of june  is as follows in thousands total fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations other liabilities a a includes an estimate of future expected funding requirements related to our pension plans 
any further funding requirements for pension plans beyond fiscal cannot be estimated at this time 
because their future cash outflows are uncertain  liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and other sundry items are excluded from the table above 
critical accounting policies the company s critical accounting policies are more fully described in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes made to the company s critical accounting policies and estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed arising from business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized 
the company evaluates goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  by applying a fair value based test and  if impairment occurs  the amount of impaired goodwill is written off immediately 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the carrying values of each of the company s reporting units to their estimated fair values as of the test dates 
the company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its reportable segments  engines and products 
the estimates of fair value of the reporting units are computed using an income approach 
the income approach utilizes a multi year forecast of estimated cash flows and a terminal value at the end of the cash flow period 
the forecast period assumptions consist of internal projections that are based on the company s budget and long range strategic plan 
the discount rate used at the test date is the weighted average cost of capital which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its book value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not deemed impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of its existing tangible assets and liabilities as well as existing identified intangible assets and previously unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the unallocated portion of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company performed the annual impairment test on its engines and products reporting units as of june  the impairment testing performed by the company at june  indicated that the estimated fair value of the engines reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  including recorded goodwill  and as such  no further impairment existed 
the estimated fair value of the engines reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
however  the impairment analysis determined that the products reporting unit had goodwill balances that were impaired 
therefore  the company recognized a million non cash goodwill impairment charge during the fourth quarter of in fiscal  no goodwill impairment existed 
in fiscal  the impairment analysis determined that the goodwill balance of the products reporting unit was impaired 
as a result  the company recognized a million non cash goodwill impairment charge during fiscal the assumptions included in the impairment test require judgment  and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculation 
other than management s internal projections of future cash flows  the primary assumptions used in the impairment test were the weighted average cost of capital and long term growth rates 
the methods of assessing fair value for goodwill and tradename impairment purposes require significant judgments to be made by management 
although the company s cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates management is using to operate the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to these businesses 
the growth rates and gross profit margins used for the terminal value calculations and the discount rates of the respective reporting units as of june  were as follows terminal growth rate terminal gross profit margin discount rate engines products changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
tradenames are not amortized 
if impairment occurs  the impaired amount of the tradename is written off immediately 
for purposes of the tradename impairment analysis  the company performs its assessment of fair value based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method 
this methodology assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of these types of assets 
the company determines the fair value of each tradename by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net sales discounted using a risk adjusted cost of capital 
the company believes the relief from royalty method to be an acceptable methodology due to its common use by valuation specialists in determining the fair value of intangible assets 
sales growth rates are determined after considering current and future economic conditions  recent sales trends  discussions with customers  planned timing of new product launches and many other variables 
each royalty rate is based on profitability of the business to which it relates and observed market royalty rates 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company performed the annual impairment test on its indefinite lived intangible assets as of june  the impairment testing performed by the company at june  indicated that the estimated fair value of a tradename in its products reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount 
therefore  the company recognized a million non cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter of in fiscal and  no intangible asset impairments existed 
the assumptions included in the impairment test require judgment  and changes to these inputs could impact the results of the calculation 
definite lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and patents 
these definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment testing if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
income taxes the company s estimate of income taxes payable  deferred income taxes  tax contingencies and the effective tax rate is based on a complex analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal  state and foreign income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities  estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions  and current accounting standards 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
we review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known 
in addition  federal  state and foreign taxing authorities periodically review the company s estimates and interpretation of income tax laws 
adjustments to the effective income tax rate and recorded tax related assets and liabilities may occur in future periods if actual results differ significantly from original estimates and interpretations 
pension and other postretirement plans the pension benefit obligation and related pension expense or income are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance  which is essential in the current volatile market 
actuarial valuations at june  used a discount rate of and the determination of fiscal expense used an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
our discount rate was selected using a methodology that matches plan cash flows with a selection of moody s aa or higher rated bonds  resulting in a discount rate that better matches a bond yield curve with comparable cash flows 
a decrease in the discount rate would decrease annual pension service and interest costs by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase our annual pension service and interest costs by approximately million 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the historical returns on plan assets  adjusted for forward looking considerations  including inflation assumptions and active management of the plan s invested assets  knowing that our investment performance has been in the top decile compared to other plans 
changes in the discount rate and return on assets can have a significant effect on the funded status of our pension plans  shareholders investment and related expense 
we cannot predict these changes in discount rates or investment returns and  therefore  cannot reasonably estimate whether the impact in subsequent years will be significant 
the funded status of the company s pension plan is the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of its plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of all benefits expected to be earned by the employees service adjusted for future potential wage increases 
at june  and july   the fair value of plan assets was less than the projected benefit obligation by approximately million and million  respectively 
on july   the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map act was signed into law 
the map act included certain pension related provisions which included changes to the methodology used to determine discount rates for erisa funding purposes for qualified defined benefit pension plans 
based on historical interest rates  the map act allows plan sponsors to utilize a higher discount rate to value pension liabilities  which results in lower required pension plan contributions under erisa 
based upon current regulations and actuarial studies the company is required to make no minimum contributions to the qualified pension plan in fiscal and the company may be required to make further contributions in future years depending on the actual return on plan assets and the funded status of the plan in future periods 
in october  the board of directors of the company authorized an amendment to the company defined benefit retirement plans for us  non bargaining employees 
the amendment freezes accruals for all non bargaining employees effective january  the company recorded a pre tax curtailment charge of million in fiscal related to the defined benefit plan change 
the other postretirement benefits obligation and related expense or income are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the health care trend rate 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point  would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit by million and decrease the service and interest cost by million 
for pension and postretirement benefits  actuarial gains and losses are accounted for in accordance with us gaap 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
other reserves the reserves for customer rebates  warranty  product liability  inventory and doubtful accounts are fact specific and take into account such factors as specific customer situations  historical experience  and current and expected economic conditions 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income
