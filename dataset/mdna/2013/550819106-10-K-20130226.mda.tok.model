for  the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was significantly impacted by a tax benefit of million associated with a change in assertion regarding unremitted foreign earnings related to its german branch 
this was offset by valuation allowances against foreign tax credit carryovers and state net operating loss carryovers  as future realization was not reasonably assured  that generated tax expense of million and million of tax expense associated with dividends from a foreign subsidiary 
the impact of those items and a reduction in reserves for tax contingencies contributed to the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations differing from the statutory federal income tax rate in the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return  as well as returns required by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities  including such major jurisdictions as the united states  france  germany and the netherlands 
within the next fiscal year  the company expects to conclude certain us federal income tax matters through the year ended december  and it is reasonably expected that net unrecognized benefits of million may be recognized 
the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized was million as of december  with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal examinations for years before  state and local examinations for years before  and non us income tax examinations for years before segment results

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
note in notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management is required to make judgments about and estimates of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
goodwill the company had goodwill of million at december  and million at december  goodwill is not amortized  but rather is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  including related goodwill 
the company s reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that operating segment or component 
asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  permits a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if after assessing qualitative factors a conclusion is reached that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the company is required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets  goodwill is considered not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit goodwill 
determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent of the difference 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment analysis of the million of goodwill in the performance materials reporting unit pm reporting unit and million of goodwill in the life sciences vital fluids reporting unit vf reporting unit  included in ops 
after considering changes to assumptions used in the company s most recent quantitative annual testing  including the capital markets environment  economic conditions  industry trends  changes in results of operations  the magnitude of the excess of fair value over the carrying amount of the pm reporting unit  and other factors  the company concluded it was not necessary to perform the two step impairment test for the pm reporting unit as it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the pm reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
as a result  the company concluded that the pm reporting unit goodwill was not impaired 
the company performed a quantitative two step approach to test the vf reporting unit for impairment due to the results of the impairment analysis and historical financial results 
during  the vf reporting unit met the discounted cash flow projections included in the income approach calculation  primarily as a result of sales growth 
for  the company used both the income approach and market approach in performing step one of the impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of the vf reporting unit 
the company determined that the vf reporting unit  with million of goodwill  had excess fair value over its carrying value  and as a result  step two of the impairment test was not required 
in performing step one of the impairment analysis to estimate the fair value of the vf reporting unit for  the company used both i the income approach discounted cash flows  and ii the market approach comparable company analysis 
the income approach involved determining the present value of future cash flows from the reporting unit s projected financial results in and the projected cash 
table of contents flows beyond that three year period computed as the terminal value 
the company believes the income approach was appropriate because it provided a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long term operations and cash flow performance 
in applying the market approach  valuation multiples were derived from historic and projected operating data of selected guideline companies  which were evaluated and adjusted  if necessary  based on the strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit relative to the selected guideline companies 
the valuation multiples were then applied to the appropriate projected operating data of the reporting unit to arrive at an indication of fair value 
the company believes the market approach was appropriate because it provided a fair value using multiples from companies with operations and economic characteristics similar to its reporting unit 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other factors such as market capitalization and other market information 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge 
if future operating performance in the vf reporting unit does not reasonably meet expectations or other key assumptions change or are not met  then a non cash impairment charge to income from operations could occur 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company judgment and estimates of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
if the carrying values of the assets are determined to be impaired  then the carrying values are reduced to their estimated fair values 
the fair values of the impaired assets are determined based on market conditions  including independent appraisals when appropriate  the income approach  which utilizes cash flow projections  and other factors 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed an impairment analysis for long lived assets at the company s solutech operation  included in the performance materials segment 
negative cash flows in combined with historical operating losses contributed to testing the solutech asset group for recoverability 
acquisition related intangibles with a remaining useful life of six years primarily comprise the carrying value of the asset group of million 
negative cash flows are a result of a delay in commercialization of solutech products to the market place by solutech s customers 
to determine the recoverability of the solutech asset group  the company completed an undiscounted cash flow analysis and compared it to the asset group carrying value 
this analysis was completed over the period and is dependent on the expected increase of net sales over the period when the business has technological exclusivity provided by the intangible assets 
the company determined that the solutech asset group had undiscounted cash flow in excess of its carrying value  and as a result  the asset group was not impaired at december  the estimate of undiscounted cash flows of the solutech long lived asset group was based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporated management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other market information 
based on developments with solutech customers and the expectation of sales growth with other oems  the company expects to meet the cash flow forecasts included in the impairment analysis 
future cash flows are dependent on the success of commercialization efforts of solutech products by oems  the quality of solutech products and technology advancements 
small changes in future operating results  compared to projections in the cash flow analysis  could result in a future non cash impairment charge to income from operations 
pensions pension cost and the related obligations recognized in the consolidated financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuaries based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its domestic defined benefit pension plan 

table of contents pension plans outside the united states are not significant at december  the domestic defined benefit pension plan  which covers certain domestic lydall employees  is noncontributory and benefits are based on either years of service or eligible compensation paid while a participant is in a plan 
the plan is closed to new employees and benefits under the pension plan are no longer accruing 
a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  including the allocation of the company s investment between equity and fixed income funds  the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets was lowered to at december   which will be utilized for determining pension cost 
an expected long term rate of return of was used for determining pension expense and in determining and pension expense 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of marketable debt and equity securities and economic and other indicators of future performance 
investment management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to balance market risk and to provide sufficient liquidity for near term payments of benefits accrued under the plan and to pay the expenses of administration 
the investment plan assets are stated at fair value  which is based on quoted market prices in an active market 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the company based its discount rate assumption on an analysis which included the selection of a bond portfolio comprised of high quality fixed income investments whose cash flows would provide for the projected benefit payments of the plan 
the discount rate is then developed as the single rate that equates the market value of the bond portfolio to the discounted value of the plan benefit payments 
at december  and  the company determined this rate to be and  respectively 
increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
pension accounting guidance requires that gains or losses be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in the pension accounting guidance 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
since benefit accruals were frozen on certain domestic defined benefit pension plans on june   these plan participants are considered inactive participants 
therefore  the gain loss amortization for these plans is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants 
as of december  and  the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently  pension cost for will include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pension expense related to its domestic defined benefit pension plan of million as a result of the expected return on assets being lower than the aggregate of interest cost and the amortization of actuarial loss 
as discussed above  the company s discount rate was at december  and will be used for purposes of determining pension cost 
pension expense for is expected to be in the range of million to million 
the company contributed million to its domestic defined benefit pension plan during and expects to contribute approximately million in income taxes the company accounts for income taxes recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 

table of contents in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company analyzes historical financial results by jurisdiction and estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return  as well as returns required by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities  including such major jurisdictions as the united states  france  germany and the netherlands 
with few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal examinations for years before  state and local examinations for years before  and non us income tax examinations for years before in assessing the need for reserves for uncertainties in income taxes recognized  a significant number of estimates and judgments must be made by the company 
the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized was million as of december  united states income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable 
the company s intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so 
the company s effective tax rates in future periods could be affected by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated in countries where tax rates differ from the united states federal rate  the relative impact of permanent tax adjustments on higher or lower earnings from domestic operations  changes in net deferred tax asset valuation allowances  changes in tax rates or tax laws and the completion of tax audits 
equity compensation plans the company accounts for awards of equity instruments under the fair value method of accounting and recognizes such amounts in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the entire award 
stock based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures and such estimates of forfeitures are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
the effect of changes in estimated forfeitures is recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
the company estimates the fair value of option grants based on the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility and expected term are based on historical information 
the company believes that future volatility and expected term are not likely to materially differ from the company s historical stock price volatility and historical exercise data  respectively 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended december
