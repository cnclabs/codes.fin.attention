item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the heading risk factors elsewhere in this report 
general we are a molecular diagnostics company that operates primarily in the field of genetic analysis and molecular diagnostics through our wholly owned subsidiary  combimatrix molecular diagnostics  inc cmdx  located in irvine  california 
cmdx operates as a diagnostics reference laboratory providing dna based clinical diagnostic testing services to physicians  hospitals  clinics and other laboratories in two primary areas i prenatal and postnatal developmental disorders  and ii hematology oncology genomics 
cmdx provides its services primarily through the use of array comparative genomic hybridization acgh  which enables the analysis of genetic anomalies  as well as through other test offerings including fluorescent in situ hybridization fish and g band chromosome analysis 
our mission is to empower physicians to positively impact patient care through the delivery of innovative molecular diagnostics services 
prior to  we were primarily focused on developing proprietary dna array based tools and instruments for the genetic research community  under the brand formerly known as customarray  as well as providing molecular diagnostics services through cmdx 
on april   we announced a strategic and operational restructuring plan the restructuring plan intended to significantly reduce operating costs  increase the focus on our diagnostic services business and transition senior management 
as part of the restructuring plan  we closed our customarray business and facilities located in mukilteo  washington and relocated our corporate headquarters to irvine  california 
since the restructuring  our primary focus has been on our diagnostics services business 
our goals include increasing utilization of our existing tests  expanding our diagnostic test menu  increasing and diversifying our client base  and improving reimbursement for our testing services 
as a result of executing the restructuring plan  the financial results of our customarray business have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
unless otherwise noted  amounts and disclosures throughout this report relate to our continuing operations 
we also own a one third minority interest in leuchemix  inc leuchemix  a private drug development company focused on developing a series of compounds to address a number of oncology related diseases 

table of contents liquidity at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
from january  through march   we have received net proceeds of million from financing activities discussed further below 
as a result  we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalent balances  inclusive of recent financing activities and coupled with anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements into the fourth quarter of in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond this point and ultimately to achieve profitability  we will be required to obtain capital from external sources  increase revenues and reduce operating costs 
however  there can be no assurances that our operations will become profitable or that external sources of financing  including the issuance of debt and or equity securities  will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs  including research projects and personnel  which could jeopardize our future strategic initiatives and business plans 
see the liquidity and capital resources section below as well as note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these matters 
overview of recent business activities during  our business activities were driven primarily by commercialization efforts for our suite of molecular diagnostic tests  expansion of our test menu and of our leadership team 
for the year ended december   our operating activities included the recognition of million of total revenues  which increased by  from due primarily to increased volumes of molecular diagnostic tests performed  increases in royalty revenues and from recognition of one time revenues from providing clinical trials support services to one customer during the third quarter of in the area of molecular testing  our volumes from our prenatal testing services increased by from  and total molecular testing from all of our test offerings increased by 
our net loss from operations decreased over the comparable period due to increased revenues and also from reduced operating expenses as a result of cost reduction efforts executed during the second quarter of  which included the elimination of certain staff positions across all functional areas of the company 
our net loss increased due primarily from charges recognized in relating to mark to market adjustments of our warrant derivative liabilities  which were issued as part of an equity financing discussed 
also during  we made significant changes to our executive management and leadership teams by hiring richard hockett  md  as our chief medical officer  who joined us on may   and by hiring mark mcdonough as chief commercial officer  who joined us on august  during the first quarter of  we named richard ding and joseph limber to our board of directors and  during the second quarter  appointed dr 
ronald j 
wapner to our scientific advisory board 
on october   mr 
limber resigned from our board for personal reasons 
during the fourth quarter of  we named jeremy jones to our board of directors 
on october   we announced the execution of an agreement to issue securities in a private placement transaction to certain accredited investors investors that resulted in gross proceeds paid to us of million  which was received in two tranches  with the first tranche having closed on october  and the second tranche having closed on december   following the approval by our stockholders at a special meeting held on november  the financing was through the sale of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock the series a financing at warrant coverage  meaning that the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants was equal to the number of shares of common stock initially issuable from conversions of the series a preferred stock 
for the first tranche  the conversion price of the series a preferred stock and the exercise price of the common stock warrants were and per share of common stock  respectively  subject to future adjustments 
for the second tranche  the conversion price of the series a preferred stock 
table of contents and the exercise price of the common stock warrants were and per share of common stock  respectively  also subject to future adjustments 
as a result of closing the second tranche at a conversion price lower than the first tranche  the conversion price of the first tranche series a preferred stock was reduced to and the number of shares of common stock issuable from conversion of the series a preferred stock was increased 
in total  the million of series a preferred stock issued during the fourth quarter of was convertible into million shares of common stock  along with warrants series a warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the preferred stock also accrued dividends at an annual rate of 
on february   we entered into an agreement with the investors to modify the series a warrants such that they would become immediately exercisable as of february  the modification date 
since the modification date through march    shares of common stock have been issued from exercise of the warrants  resulting in gross proceeds to the company of  on february   r 
judd jessup informed our board of directors that he would retire as chief executive officer effective march  martin felsenthal also resigned from our board on the same date 
mark mcdonough  our chief commercial officer  became a director on february  and chief executive officer on march  richard hockett  jr  md  our chief medical officer  was also named to our board of directors on february  on march   mark mcgowan announced his resignation from our board  and r 
judd jessup was appointed chairman of the board on that date 
on march   we entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with an existing institutional investor to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share and approximately  units consisting of series b convertible preferred stock the series b preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share the series b warrants in a registered direct offering the series b offering of securities off of our existing shelf registration statement on form s file no 

the series b offering closed on march  closing 
the series b preferred stock and series b warrants were sold in multiples of fixed combinations  with each fixed combination consisting of one share of series b preferred stock and a series b warrant to purchase approximately shares of common stock 
each fixed combination of series b preferred stock and series b warrants were sold at a price of  the series b preferred stock is convertible into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
the series b preferred stock is not convertible into greater than when aggregated with the common shares purchased in the offering of our outstanding common stock unless and until stockholder approval is obtained 
the series b warrants are not exercisable for six months from closing  and the series b preferred stock will accrue dividends at an annual rate of beginning six months after closing  assuming the series b preferred stock has not been converted by that time 
upon closing of the offering  we received proceeds of million  net of placement agent fees and other related costs 
also as a result of the offering  the exercise price of certain series a warrants automatically ratcheted down by their terms from their original exercise price of per share to an adjusted exercise price of per share  and the underlying shares exercisable was automatically increased from  shares to  shares 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 

table of contents we believe that  of the significant accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments revenue recognition and estimates for contractual allowances  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for derivative financial instruments  fair value measurements  and accounting for income taxes 
we discuss below the critical accounting assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition as described below  significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized or deferred for any period if management made different judgments 
in general  we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been performed  iii amounts are fixed or determinable and iv collectability of amounts is reasonably assured 
service revenues from providing diagnostic tests are recognized when the testing process is complete and test results are reported to the ordering physician or clinic 
these diagnostic services are billed to various payors  including commercial insurance companies  healthcare institutions  individuals and government payors including medicare and medicaid 
we report revenues from contracted payors based on a contractual rate  or in the case of medicare and medicaid  published fee schedules for our tests 
we report revenues from non contracted payors based on the amount expected to be collected 
the difference between the amount billed and the amount expected to be collected from non contracted payors is recorded as a contractual allowance to arrive at net recognized revenues 
the expected revenues from non contracted payors are based on the historical collection experience of each payor or payor group  as appropriate 
in each reporting period  we review our historical collection experience for non contracted payors and adjust our expected revenues for current and subsequent periods accordingly 
we also recognize additional revenue from actual cash payments that exceed amounts initially recognized  in the period the payments are received 
because a substantial portion of our revenues is from non contracted third party payors  it is likely that we will be required to make positive or negative adjustments to accounting estimates with respect to contractual allowances in the future  which may positively or adversely affect our results of operations 
in all cases described above  we report revenues net of any applicable statutory taxes collected from customers  as applicable 
accounting for stock based compensation the compensation cost for all employee stock based awards is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense  on a straight line basis  over the employee requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award which is generally three to four years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant and reflect the impact of estimated pre vesting option forfeitures in compensation expense recognized 

table of contents accounting for derivative financial instruments we evaluate financial instruments for freestanding or embedded derivatives 
derivative instruments that do not qualify for permanent equity classification are recorded as liabilities at fair value  with changes in value recognized as other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change 
derivative warrant liabilities are categorized as either short term or long term based upon management estimates as to when the derivative instrument may be realized 
management judgment is required in identifying derivative instruments and whether or not such instruments should be classified as liabilities or as a component of permanent equity based upon interpretations of existing accounting literature 
also  management judgment is required in determining the assumptions and valuation methods to be used for valuing the derivatives 
if actual results differ from these estimates  the future impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations could be significant 
fair value measurements we measure fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
we utilize a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable market inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level observable market inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs where there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions accounting for income taxes we recognize income taxes on an accrual basis based on tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax returns 
a tax position is defined as a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax filing that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not ie  likelihood of greater than  based on technical merits  that the position would be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are measured using a probability weighted approach as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if all  or some portion  of such assets will more than likely not be realized 
should they occur  our policy is to classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as income tax expense 
since our inception  no such interest or penalties have been incurred  however 

table of contents comparison of the results of operations revenues and cost of revenues dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change diagnostic services clinical trial support services royalties cost of services diagnostic services 
diagnostic services revenues are generated from providing dna based genomic testing services primarily in the areas of prenatal and postnatal development disorders in children and  to a lesser extent  in oncology 
total billable testing volumes were  for the year ended december   compared to  for  representing an increase of 
the reason that diagnostic services revenues have not increased by the same percentage as diagnostic testing volumes is due to a change in mix during of the types of diagnostic services performed 
cytogenetic tests in the prenatal market  including fish and chromosome analysis  are priced and reimbursed at lower rates than our array based tests  which made up the majority of our testing volumes in as a result  our average revenue per test decreased from in to in in addition  decreases in oncology and pediatric testing volumes were offset by increases in prenatal testing  resulting in an overall increase in diagnostic services revenues year over year 
diagnostic services revenues also includes adjustments relating to our revenue recognition policy of periodically adjusting our estimate for contractual allowances for revenues from non contracted payors as well as from receiving cash payments in excess of amounts previously recognized for services revenues 
for the years ended december  and  net positive revenue adjustments were  and  respectively 
clinical trial support services 
in june of  we entered into a materials transfer agreement with affymetrix  inc in support of their clinical trial program 
under the terms of the agreement  we delivered over anonymous patient samples during the third quarter 
as a result  we fully satisfied our obligations to affymetrix  which resulted in recognition of  of clinical trial support services revenues in there are no future performance obligations by either party and we do not expect to recognize additional revenues from this agreement in the future 
royalties 
in  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with customarray  inc ca  a private company located in washington state  for certain of our patents and intellectual property developed as part of our prior microarray manufacturing business 
this agreement requires ca to pay us royalties as a percentage of their gross revenues  not less than  per quarter 
beginning in the second quarter of  ca gross revenues exceeded the minimum thresholds stipulated in the licensing agreement  resulting in total royalties of  for  compared to  in it is uncertain whether in future periods  ca revenues will increase  continue at current levels or return to the minimum contractual amounts 
cost of services 
cost of services relating to our diagnostic tests performed include direct materials such as array and laboratory costs  direct laboratory labor wages and benefits  allocation of administrative overhead and stock compensation expenses 
due primarily to favorable pricing obtained on certain of our direct materials used in providing our services  the percentage changes from to are not proportional to the change in revenues during the same periods 
for the years ended december  and  non cash stock compensation expenses were not significant 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts of non cash stock compensation expense recognized for the periods presented 

table of contents operating expenses dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change research and development sales and marketing general and administrative research and development 
these expenses include labor and laboratory supply costs associated with investigating new tests  but primarily consist of development costs to maintain and improve our existing suite of diagnostic tests offered 
prior to launching a new test or modifying an existing test  appropriate clinical trials and extensive laboratory validations  consistent with the various regulations that govern our industry  must be performed 
these costs are classified as research and development for all periods presented 
the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to higher laboratory supply costs from test validations of new cytogenetics and related tests launched in early  as well as from higher headcount during the first half of compared to  partially offset by lower headcount during the second half of as a result of cost reductions executed in may and june of in addition  research and development expenses include non cash stock compensation charges  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in stock compensation charges was due primarily to prior stock option awards to our employees which became fully vested late in see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts of non cash stock compensation expense recognized for the periods presented 
sales and marketing 
these expenses include salaries and wages associated with our sales force and marketing resources  sales commissions and other expenses associated with promotional and advertising efforts 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to fewer sales personnel in compared to as a result of the cost reductions executed in may and june of in addition  sales and marketing expenses include non cash stock compensation charges  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in stock compensation charges was due primarily to prior stock option awards to our employees which became fully vested in and from fewer sales personnel with stock option awards continuing to vest 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts of non cash stock compensation expense recognized for the periods presented 
general and administrative 
these expenses include compensation and benefit costs of our administrative staff  client billing and collections  information technology  executive management  human resources and accounting personnel  as well as facilities related costs  insurance  legal  audit and other professional services 
excluding non cash stock compensation expenses discussed below  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to higher salaries and benefits costs associated with our chief medical officer and from increased staff in our billing department  increased recruitment expenses associated with new board members and executive management and from increased litigation defense costs as compared to included in general and administrative expenses were non cash stock compensation charges of  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the decrease in stock compensation charges was due primarily to prior stock option awards to our employees which became fully vested in see note to our consolidated interim financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts of non cash stock compensation expense recognized for the periods presented 

table of contents other non operating items dollars in thousands for the years ended december  change interest expense warrant derivatives charges interest expense 
prior to the fourth quarter of  interest expense was entirely comprised of interest charges associated with from certain capital leases for laboratory equipment  which were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition   of interest expense in is related to the amortization of  of offering related costs incurred during the fourth quarter of these costs are being amortized over the warrant exercise restriction period of six months from issuance  which will result in the remaining  of unamortized charges being expensed during the first quarter of warrant derivative charges 
these charges represent the net expense recognized from mark to market adjustments of the warrants to their estimated fair values as of december  there were no such activities in we valued the warrants using the monte carlo simulation method using the following assumptions at each valuation date i closing stock price and warrant contractual exercise price  ii term to expiration commensurate with the individual warrant terms ranging from years to years  iii historical volatilities commensurate with the term of the warrants ranging from to  iv risk free interest rates commensurate with the term of the warrants ranging from to  and v simulated anti dilution impact assuming various probabilities that company will raise additional capital by issuing equity securities at prices above or below the current contractual warrant exercise prices during the warrant terms 
the result of these valuation simulations was to initially value the warrants issued at a combined million derivative liability  with the residual value allocated to the series a preferred stock 
subsequently  the fair value of the warrants increased to million at december   resulting in million of warrant derivative charges recognized during the fourth quarter of the warrants were valued as level liabilities under our policies for assessing fair value measurements 
if the inputs such as volatility and probability of subsequent financings were to change  the concluded values could change significantly 
discontinued operations dollars in thousands for the years ended change income from discontinued operations on april   we announced a restructuring plan intended to focus our company on our diagnostic services business while shutting down our customarray business 
the operations of our former customarray business are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
income from final billings on former department of defense contracts occurred and was recognized during the first and second quarters of there were no activities relating to discontinued operations since the second quarter of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact in the current or prior periods 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared to million at december  cash is held primarily in general checking accounts as well as in money market mutual funds backed by us government securities 
working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the primary reason for the decline in working capital was due to lower cash balances at december  compared to and from classifying the warrants  valued at million net of issuance costs  as current liabilities as of december  the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented was comprised of the following in thousands for the years ended december  change net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
the decrease in net cash flows used in operating activities was primarily the result of higher cash reimbursement from increased sales  billing and collection efforts experienced during compared to investing activities 
the decrease in net cash flows used in investing activities was due to decreased capital expenditures for laboratory and it related equipment to support our diagnostics business 
financing activities 
the decrease in net cash flows from financing activities was due primarily to the million of net proceeds received from the series a financing during the fourth quarter of compared to the million of net proceeds received from a private placement of common stock and warrants to certain investors during the second quarter of future liquidity 
we have a history of incurring net losses and net operating cash flow deficits 
we are also deploying new technologies and continue to develop commercial products and services 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances as of december   combined with the million of combined proceeds from certain series a warrant exercises and proceeds from the offering described above  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements into the fourth quarter of in order for us to continue as a going concern beyond this point and ultimately to achieve profitability  we may be required to obtain capital from external sources  increase revenues and reduce operating costs 
however  there can be no assurance that our operations will become profitable or that external sources of financing  including the issuance of debt and or equity securities  will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us  or at all 
the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs  including research projects and personnel  which could jeopardize our future strategic initiatives and business plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these matters 
capital requirements 
we may also encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated 
any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through equity  debt or other external financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding will be 
table of contents available on favorable terms  in a timely manner or at all 
our long term capital requirements will be substantial and the adequacy of available funds will depend upon many factors  including the costs of commercialization activities  including sales and marketing  manufacturing and capital equipment  competing technological developments  the creation and formation of strategic partnerships  the costs associated with leasing and improving our irvine  california facility  and other factors that may not be within our control 
we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures in or beyond 
we have executed twelve capital leases totaling  for certain laboratory equipment 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k promulgated by the sec 
however  we have entered into an operating lease for our laboratory space and corporate offices  totaling approximately  square feet
