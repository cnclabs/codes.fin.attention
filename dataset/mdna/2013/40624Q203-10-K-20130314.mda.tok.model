analysis of loss and lae reserve development 
the following table shows the development of our loss reserves  net of reinsurance  for years ended december  through section a of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
this liability represents the estimated amount of losses and lae for claims arising in prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date  including losses that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
section b of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded liability  based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims 
cumulative redundancy deficiency section c of the table represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
thus  changes in ultimate development estimates are included in operations over a number of years  minimizing the significance of such changes in any one year

investment portfolio our investment objective is to maximize current yield while maintaining safety of capital together with sufficient liquidity for ongoing insurance operations 
our investment portfolio is composed of fixed income and equity securities 
as of december   we had total invested assets of million

our investment portfolio is managed internally 
we regularly review our portfolio for declines in value 
for fixed maturity investments that are considered other than temporarily impaired and that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell  we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related credit loss component and the amount due to all other factors 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows 
the remaining difference between the investment s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is recognized in other comprehensive income

ratings many insurance buyers  agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by am best and other rating agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance 
am best has pooled its ratings of our ahic  hic  hsic and hnic subsidiaries and assigned a financial strength rating of a excellent and an issuer credit rating of a to each of these individual insurance company subsidiaries and to the pool formed by the four insurance company subsidiaries 
am best has also assigned a financial strength rating of a excellent and an issuer credit rating of a to hcm 
am best does not assign a financial strength rating or an issuer credit rating to tbic 
an a rating is the fourth highest of rating categories used by am best 
in evaluating an insurer s financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  indebtedness and liquidity  as well as its book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated fair value of its assets  the adequacy of its loss reserves  the adequacy of its surplus  its capital structure  the experience and competence of its management and its market presence 
am best s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurer s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors or recommendations to buy  sell or hold an insurer s stock 
competition the property casualty insurance market  our primary source of revenue  is highly competitive and  except for regulatory considerations  has very few barriers to entry 
according to am best  there were  property casualty insurance companies and  property casualty insurance groups operating in north america as of july  our standard commercial p c business unit competes with a variety of large national standard commercial lines carriers such as liberty mutual group  travelers companies  inc  cincinnati financial corporation and the hartford financial services group  as well as numerous smaller regional companies 
the primary competition for our workers compensation business unit includes such carriers as texas mutual insurance company  service lloyds insurance company  employers insurance company  the hartford financial services group and firstcomp insurance company 
the primary competition for our e s commercial business unit includes such carriers as american international group  inc  atlantic casualty insurance company  canal insurance company  carolina casualty insurance company  century surety insurance group  colony insurance company  gramercy insurance company  global hawk insurance company  great western insurance company  home state county mutual insurance company  new york marine general insurance company  praetorian insurance company  progressive insurance company  scottsdale insurance company  southern county mutual insurance company  sparta insurance company  stratford insurance company  torus insurance holdings limited and zurich insurance group limited 
our general aviation business unit considers its primary competitors to be phoenix aviation managers  starr aviation  chartis  united states specialty insurance company  w 
brown company  meadowbrook insurance company  global aerospace and allianz aviation managers 
the primary competition for our excess umbrella business unit includes such carriers as american international group  inc  first mercury insurance company  axis insurance company  wr berkley corporation and  to a lesser extent  a number of national standard lines carriers such as travelers companies  inc and liberty mutual group 
although our personal lines business unit competes with large national insurers such as allstate corporation  geico corporation and progressive insurance company  as a participant in the non standard personal automobile marketplace its competition is most directly associated with numerous regional companies and managing general agencies 
our competitors include entities that have  or are affiliated with entities that have  greater financial and other resources than we have 
generally  we compete on price  customer service  coverages offered  claims handling  financial stability  agent commission and support  customer recognition and geographic coverage 
we compete with companies who use independent agents  captive agent networks  direct marketing channels or a combination thereof 
insurance regulation ahic  hcm and tbic are domiciled in texas  hic is domiciled in arizona  hsic is domiciled in oklahoma and hnic is domiciled in ohio 
therefore  our insurance operations are regulated by the texas department of insurance  the arizona department of insurance  the oklahoma insurance department and the ohio department of insurance  as well as the applicable insurance department of each state in which we issue policies 
our insurance company subsidiaries are required to file quarterly and annual statements of their financial condition prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices with the insurance departments of their respective states of domicile and the applicable insurance department of each state in which they write business 
the financial conditions of our insurance company subsidiaries  including the adequacy of surplus  loss reserves and investments  are subject to review by the insurance department of their respective states of domicile 
periodic financial and market conduct examinations 
the insurance departments of the states of domicile for our insurance company subsidiaries have broad authority to enforce insurance laws and regulations through examinations  administrative orders  civil and criminal enforcement proceedings  and suspension or revocation of an insurer s certificate of authority or an agent s license 
the state insurance departments that have jurisdiction over our insurance company subsidiaries may conduct on site visits and examinations of the insurance companies affairs  especially as to their financial condition  ability to fulfill their obligations to policyholders  market conduct  claims practices and compliance with other laws and applicable regulations 
typically  these examinations are conducted every three to five years 
in addition  if circumstances dictate  regulators are authorized to conduct special or target examinations of insurance companies to address particular concerns or issues 
the results of these examinations can give rise to injunctive relief  regulatory orders requiring remedial or other corrective action on the part of the company that is the subject of the examination  assessment of fines  or other penalties against that company 
in extreme cases  including actual or pending insolvency  the insurance department may take over  or appoint a receiver to take over  the management or operations of an insurer or an agent s business or assets 
guaranty funds 
all insurance companies are subject to assessments for state administered funds that cover the claims and expenses of insolvent or impaired insurers 
the size of the assessment is determined each year by the total claims on the fund that year 
each insurer is assessed a pro rata share based on its direct premiums written in that state 
payments to the fund may generally be recovered by the insurer through deductions from its premium taxes over a specified period of years 
transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates 
hallmark is also regulated as an insurance holding company by the texas department of insurance  the arizona department of insurance  the oklahoma insurance department and the ohio insurance department 
financial transactions between hallmark or any of its affiliates and our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulation 
transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates generally must be disclosed to state regulators  and prior regulatory approval generally is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated or any management agreement  services agreement  expense sharing arrangement or other contract providing for the rendering of services on a regular  systematic basis is implemented 
state regulators may refuse to approve or may delay approval of such a transaction  which may impact our ability to innovate or operate efficiently 
dividends 
dividends and distributions to hallmark by our insurance company subsidiaries are restricted by the insurance regulations of the respective state in which each insurance company subsidiary is domiciled 
as property casualty insurance company s domiciled in the state of texas  ahic and tbic may only pay dividends from unassigned surplus funds 
in addition  ahic and tbic must obtain the approval of the texas department of insurance before the payment of extraordinary dividends  which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding months exceeds the greater of statutory net income as of the prior december st or of statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior december hic  domiciled in arizona  may pay dividends out of that part of its available surplus funds that is derived from realized net profits on its business 
without prior written approval from the arizona department of insurance  hic may not pay extraordinary dividends  which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding months exceeds the lesser of of statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior december or net investment income as of the prior december hsic  domiciled in oklahoma  may only pay dividends out of that part of its available surplus funds that is derived from realized net profits on its business 
without prior written approval from the oklahoma insurance department  hsic may not pay extraordinary dividends  which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding months exceeds the greater of of statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior december or statutory net income as of the prior december  not including realized capital gains 
hnic  domiciled in ohio  may only pay dividends out of that part of its available surplus funds that is derived from earned surplus to shareholders 
without prior written approval from the ohio department of insurance  hnic may not pay extraordinary dividends  which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding months exceeds the greater of of statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior december or statutory net income as of the prior december as a county mutual  dividends from hcm are payable to policyholders 
risk based capital requirements 
the national association of insurance commissioners requires property casualty insurers to file a risk based capital calculation according to a specified formula 
the purpose of the formula is twofold to assess the adequacy of an insurer s statutory capital and surplus based upon a variety of factors such as potential risks related to investment portfolio  ceded reinsurance and product mix  and to assist state regulators under the rbc for insurers model act by providing thresholds at which a state commissioner is authorized and expected to take regulatory action 
as of december   the adjusted capital under the risk based capital calculation of each of our insurance company subsidiaries substantially exceeded the minimum requirements 
required licensing 
our non insurance company subsidiaries are subject to and in compliance with the licensing requirements of the department of insurance in each state in which they produce business 
these licenses govern  among other things  the types of insurance coverages  agency and claims services and products that we may offer consumers in these states 
such licenses typically are issued only after we file an appropriate application and satisfy prescribed criteria 
generally  each state requires one officer to maintain an agent license 
claims adjusters employed by us are also subject to the licensing requirements of each state in which they conduct business 
each employed claim adjuster either holds or has applied for the required licenses 
our premium finance subsidiaries are subject to licensing  financial reporting and certain financial requirements imposed by the texas department of insurance  as well as regulations promulgated by the texas office of consumer credit commissioner 
regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms 
the insurance laws of most states in which our subsidiaries operate require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval 
state insurance regulators have broad discretion in judging whether our rates are adequate  not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory and whether our policy forms comply with law 
the speed at which we can change our rates depends  in part  on the method by which the applicable state s rating laws are administered 
generally  state insurance regulators have the authority to disapprove our rates or request changes in our rates 
restrictions on cancellation  non renewal or withdrawal 
many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurance company s ability to exit a market 
for example  certain states limit an automobile insurance company s ability to cancel or not renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurance company from withdrawing from one or more lines of business in the state  except pursuant to a plan approved by the state insurance department 
in some states  this applies to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written  not just to a complete withdrawal 
state insurance departments may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption 
investment restrictions 
we are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and that limit the amount of investments in certain categories 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non conforming investments to be treated as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and  in some instances  would require divestiture 
trade practices 
the manner in which we conduct the business of insurance is regulated by state statutes in an effort to prohibit practices that constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
prohibited practices include disseminating false information or advertising  defamation  boycotting  coercion and intimidation  false statements or entries  unfair discrimination  rebating  improper tie ins with lenders and the extension of credit  failure to maintain proper records  failure to maintain proper complaint handling procedures  and making false statements in connection with insurance applications for the purpose of obtaining a fee  commission or other benefit 
unfair claims practices 
generally  insurance companies  adjusting companies and individual claims adjusters are prohibited by state statutes from engaging in unfair claims practices on a flagrant basis or with such frequency to indicate a general business practice 
examples of unfair claims practices include misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue  failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies  failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and settlement of claims arising under insurance policies  failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements have been completed  attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed such person was entitled  attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that was altered without notice to  or knowledge and consent of  the insured  compelling insureds to institute suits to recover amounts due under policies by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered in suits brought by them  refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation  making claim payments to an insured without indicating the coverage under which each payment is being made  delaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring an insured  claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of loss forms  both of which submissions contain substantially the same information  failing  in the case of claim denials or offers of compromise or settlement  to promptly provide a reasonable and accurate explanation of the basis for such actions  and not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt  fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear 
employees as of december   we employed people on a full time basis 
none of our employees are represented by labor unions

item a 
risk factors 
our success depends on our ability to price accurately the risks we underwrite 
our results of operations and financial condition depend on our ability to underwrite and set premium rates accurately for a wide variety of risks 
adequate rates are necessary to generate premiums sufficient to pay losses  loss settlement expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
to price our products accurately  we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data  develop  test and apply appropriate pricing techniques  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy 
our ability to undertake these efforts successfully  and as a result price our products accurately  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which are outside our control  including the availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data  the uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions  our selection and application of appropriate pricing techniques  and changes in applicable legal liability standards and in the civil litigation system generally 
consequently  we could underprice risks  which would adversely affect our profit margins  or we could overprice risks  which could reduce our sales volume and competitiveness 
in either case  our profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
our results may fluctuate as a result of cyclical changes in the property casualty insurance industry 
our revenue is primarily attributable to property casualty insurance  which as an industry is cyclical in nature and has historically been characterized by soft markets followed by hard markets 
a soft market is a period of relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and generally low premium rates 
a hard market is a period of capital shortages resulting in lack of insurance availability  relatively low levels of competition  more selective underwriting of risks and relatively high premium rates 
if we find it necessary to reduce premiums or limit premium increases due to competitive pressures on pricing in a softening market  we may experience a reduction in our premiums written and in our profit margins and revenues  which could adversely affect our financial results 
estimating reserves is inherently uncertain 
if our loss reserves are not adequate  it will have an unfavorable impact on our results 
we maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses and lae for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
reserves represent management s estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost and are not reviewed by an independent actuary 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based on management s assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability  and other factors 
these variables are affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  inflation  judicial trends and legislative changes 
many of these factors are not quantifiable 
additionally  there may be a significant lag between the occurrence of an event and the time it is reported to us 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made 
reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed 
for example  a change in december  unpaid losses and lae would have produced a million change to pretax earnings 
our gross loss and lae reserves totaled million at december  our loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss and lae  were million at that date 
because setting reserves is inherently uncertain  there can be no assurance that the current reserves will prove adequate 
our failure to maintain favorable financial strength ratings could negatively impact our ability to compete successfully 
third party rating agencies assess and rate the claims paying ability of insurers based upon criteria established by the agencies 
ahic  hic  hsic and hnic have entered into a pooling arrangement  pursuant to which ahic retains of the net premiums written by any of them  hic retains of the net premiums written by any of them  hsic retains of the net premiums written by any of them and hnic retains of the net premiums written by any of them 
am best has pooled its ratings of these four insurance company subsidiaries and assigned a financial strength rating of a excellent and an issuer credit rating of a to each of these individual insurance company subsidiaries and to the pool formed by these four insurance company subsidiaries 
also  am best has assigned hcm a financial strength rating of a excellent and an issuer credit rating of a 
am best does not assign a financial strength rating or an issuer credit rating to tbic 
these financial strength ratings are used by policyholders  insurers  reinsurers and insurance and reinsurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers 
these ratings are not evaluations directed to potential purchasers of our common stock and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our common stock 
our ratings are subject to change at any time and could be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agencies 
we believe that the ratings assigned by am best are an important factor in marketing our products 
our ability to retain our existing business and to attract new business in our insurance operations depends largely on these ratings 
our failure to maintain our ratings  or any other adverse development with respect to our ratings  could cause our current and future independent agents and insureds to choose to transact their business with more highly rated competitors 
if am best downgrades our ratings or publicly indicates that our ratings are under review  it is likely that we would not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors  and our ability to sell insurance policies could decline 
if that happens  our sales and earnings would decrease 
for example  many of our agencies and insureds have guidelines that require us to have an am best financial strength rating of a excellent or higher 
a reduction of our am best rating below a would prevent us from issuing policies to insureds or potential insureds with such ratings requirements 
lenders and reinsurers also use our am best ratings as a factor in deciding whether to transact business with us 
the failure of our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain their current ratings could dissuade a lender or reinsurance company from conducting business with us or might increase our interest or reinsurance costs 
in addition  a ratings downgrade by am best below a would require us to post collateral in support of our obligations under certain of our reinsurance agreements pursuant to which we assume business 
the loss of key executives could disrupt our business 
our success will depend in part upon the continued service of certain key executives 
our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional executives and personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with our chief executive officer or any of our other executive officers 
the loss of key personnel  or our inability to recruit and retain additional qualified personnel  could cause disruption in our business and could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies  which could materially and adversely affect our business  growth and profitability 
our industry is very competitive  which may unfavorably impact our results of operations 
the property casualty insurance market  our primary source of revenue  is highly competitive and  except for regulatory considerations  has very few barriers to entry 
according to am best  there were  property casualty insurance companies and  property casualty insurance groups operating in north america as of july  our competitors include entities that have  or are affiliated with entities that have  greater financial and other resources than we have 
in addition  competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates 
in that case  we could experience reductions in our underwriting margins  or sales of our insurance policies could decline as customers purchase lower priced products from our competitors 
losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices  or having other competitive advantages  could adversely affect our results of operations 
our results may be unfavorably impacted if we are unable to obtain adequate reinsurance 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for significant amounts of risk  especially catastrophe risks that we and our insurance company subsidiaries underwrite 
our catastrophe and non catastrophe reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal 
we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
the amount  availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions beyond our control  and may affect our ability to write additional premiums as well as our profitability 
if we are unable to obtain adequate reinsurance protection for the risks we have underwritten  we will either be exposed to greater losses from these risks or we will reduce the level of business that we underwrite  which will reduce our revenue 
if the companies that provide our reinsurance do not pay our claims in a timely manner  we could incur severe losses 
we purchase reinsurance by transferring  or ceding  part of the risk we have assumed to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer  it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
we cannot assure that our reinsurers will pay all of our reinsurance claims  or that they will pay our claims on a timely basis 
at december   we had a total of million due us from reinsurers  including million of recoverables from losses and million in ceded unearned premiums 
the largest amount due us from a single reinsurer as of december  was million reinsurance and premium recoverable from partner reinsurance company of the united states 
if any of our reinsurers are unable or unwilling to pay amounts they owe us in a timely fashion  we could suffer a significant loss or a shortage of liquidity  which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
catastrophic losses are unpredictable and may adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
property casualty insurance companies are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail storms  explosions  severe winter weather and fires  and may include man made events  such as terrorist attacks 
the incidence  frequency  and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
claims from catastrophic events could reduce our net income  cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
catastrophes may also negatively affect our ability to write new business 
increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future 
catastrophe models may not accurately predict future losses 
along with other insurers in the industry  we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios 
however  these models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred 
catastrophe models  which have been evolving since the early s  use historical information about various catastrophes and detailed information about our in force business 
while we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities  there are limitations with respect to their usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period 
examples of these limitations are significant variations in estimates between models and modelers and material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and assumptions 
such limitations lead to questionable predictive capability and post event measurements that have not been well understood or proven to be sufficiently reliable 
in addition  the models are not necessarily reflective of company or state specific policy language  demand surge for labor and materials or loss settlement expenses  all of which are subject to wide variation by catastrophe 
because the occurrence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and may vary significantly from year to year  historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation  and our results may be unfavorably impacted by these regulations 
we are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation and supervision 
most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than of the stockholders and other investors of the insurance companies 
these regulations  generally administered by the department of insurance in each state in which we do business  relate to  among other things approval of policy forms and rates  standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  which are a measure developed by the national association of insurance commissioners and used by the state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized  licensing of insurers and their agents  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the ability of insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends  restrictions on transactions between insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates  requiring certain methods of accounting  periodic examinations of operations and finances  the use of non public consumer information and related privacy issues  the use of credit history in underwriting and rating  limitations on the ability to charge policy fees  the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  involuntary assignments of high risk policies  participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations  assessments and other governmental charges  restrictions on the cancellation or non renewal of policies and  in certain jurisdictions  withdrawal from writing certain lines of business  prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition to be filed  requiring reserves for unearned premium  losses and other purposes  and with respect to premium finance business  the federal truth in lending act and similar state statutes 
in states where specific statutes have not been enacted  premium finance is generally subject to state usury laws that are applicable to consumer loans 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies  holding company issues and other matters 
our business depends on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for our operations 
regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including violations of regulations 
changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could have a material adverse affect on our operations 
in addition  we could face individual  group and class action lawsuits by our policyholders and others for alleged violations of certain state laws and regulations 
each of these regulatory risks could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
state statutes limit the aggregate amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay hallmark  thereby limiting its funds to pay expenses and dividends 
hallmark is a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
as a holding company without significant operations of its own  hallmark s principal sources of funds are dividends and other sources of funds from its subsidiaries 
state insurance laws limit the ability of hallmark s insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends and require our insurance company subsidiaries to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus 
the aggregate maximum amount of dividends permitted by law to be paid by an insurance company does not necessarily define an insurance company s actual ability to pay dividends 
the actual ability to pay dividends may be further constrained by business and regulatory considerations  such as the impact of dividends on surplus  by our competitive position and by the amount of premiums that we can write 
without regulatory approval  the aggregate maximum amount of dividends that could be paid to hallmark in by our insurance company subsidiaries is million 
state insurance regulators have broad discretion to limit the payment of dividends by insurance companies and hallmark s right to participate in any distribution of assets of one of our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to prior claims of policyholders and creditors except to the extent that its rights  if any  as a creditor are recognized 
consequently  hallmark s ability to pay debts  expenses and cash dividends to our stockholders may be limited 
our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements 
failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action 
our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of their respective states of domicile and each state in which they issue policies 
any failure by one of our insurance company subsidiaries to meet minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed by applicable state law will subject it to corrective action  which may include requiring adoption of a comprehensive financial plan  revocation of its license to sell insurance products or placing the subsidiary under state regulatory control 
any new minimum capital and surplus requirements adopted in the future may require us to increase the capital and surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries  which we may not be able to do 
we are subject to assessments and other surcharges from state guaranty funds  mandatory reinsurance arrangements and state insurance facilities  which may reduce our profitability 
virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business therein to bear a portion of the unfunded obligations of impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these obligations are funded by assessments  which are levied by guaranty associations within the state  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurers in the state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer was engaged 
accordingly  the assessments levied on us by the states in which we are licensed to write insurance may increase as we increase our premiums written 
in addition  as a condition to the ability to conduct business in certain states  insurance companies are required to participate in mandatory reinsurance funds 
the effect of these assessments and mandatory reinsurance arrangements  or changes in them  could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business 
we monitor developments with respect to various state facilities  such as the texas fair plan and the texas windstorm insurance association 
the impact of any catastrophe experience on these facilities could result in the facilities recognizing a financial deficit or a financial deficit greater than the level currently estimated 
they may  in turn  have the ability to assess participating insurers when financial deficits occur  adversely affecting our results of operations 
while these facilities are generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders  the exposure to assessments and the availability of recoupments or premium rate increases from these facilities may not offset each other in our financial statements 
moreover  even if they do offset each other  they may not offset each other in financial statements for the same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases  as well as the possibility of policies not being renewed in subsequent years 
adverse securities market conditions can have a significant and negative impact on our investment portfolio 
our results of operations depend in part on the performance of our invested assets 
as of december   of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed income securities 
certain risks are inherent in connection with fixed income securities  including loss upon default and price volatility in reaction to changes in interest rates and general market factors 
in general  the fair value of a portfolio of fixed income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in the market interest rates  while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates 
in addition  of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this subjects us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall and issuers call their securities 
furthermore  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
an investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that cash flows from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates 
the fair value of our fixed income securities as of december  was million 
if market interest rates were to increase  the fair value of our fixed income securities would decrease by approximately million as of december  the calculated change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments 
in addition to the general risks described above  although of our portfolio is investment grade  our fixed income securities are nonetheless subject to credit risk 
if any of the issuers of our fixed income securities suffer financial setbacks  the ratings on the fixed income securities could fall with a concurrent fall in market value and  in a worst case scenario  the issuer could default on its obligations 
as of december  hallmark had million exposed in its investment portfolio to sub prime mortgages and million total exposure in mortgage backed securities 
future changes in the fair value of our available for sale securities will be reflected in other comprehensive income 
similar treatment is not available for liabilities 
therefore  interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our stockholders equity  total comprehensive income and or cash flows 
we rely on independent agents and specialty brokers to market our products and their failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we market and distribute our insurance programs exclusively through independent insurance agents and specialty insurance brokers 
as a result  our business depends in large part on the marketing efforts of these agents and brokers and on our ability to offer insurance products and services that meet the requirements of the agents  the brokers and their customers 
however  these agents and brokers are not obligated to sell or promote our products and many sell or promote competitors insurance products in addition to our products 
some of our competitors have higher financial strength ratings  offer a larger variety of products  set lower prices for insurance coverage and or offer higher commissions than we do 
therefore  we may not be able to continue to attract and retain independent agents and brokers to sell our insurance products 
the failure or inability of independent agents and brokers to market our insurance products successfully could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may experience difficulty in integrating acquisitions into our operations 
the successful integration of any newly acquired businesses into our operations will require  among other things  the retention and assimilation of their key management  sales and other personnel  the coordination of their lines of insurance products and services  the adaptation of their technology  information systems and other processes  and the retention and transition of their customers 
unexpected difficulties in integrating any acquisition could result in increased expenses and the diversion of management time and resources 
if we do not successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  any potential acquisitions may require significant capital outlays and  if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to pay for an acquisition  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
our internal controls are not fail safe 
we continually enhance our operating procedures and internal controls to effectively support our business and comply with our regulatory and financial reporting requirements 
as a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control objectives have been or will be met  and that every instance of error or fraud has been or will be detected 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by individual acts or by collusion of two or more persons 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
internal controls may also become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate 
further  the design of a control system must reflect resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
as a result of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatement due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
accordingly  our internal controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control objectives are met 
our geographic concentration ties our performance to the business  economic and regulatory conditions of certain states 
the following states accounted for of our gross written premiums for texas  louisiana  oregon  new mexico and arizona 
our revenues and profitability are subject to the prevailing regulatory  legal  economic  political  demographic  competitive  weather and other conditions in the principal states in which we do business 
changes in any of these conditions could make it less attractive for us to do business in such states and would have a more pronounced effect on us compared to companies that are more geographically diversified 
in addition  our exposure to severe losses from localized natural perils  such as windstorms or hailstorms  is increased in those areas where we have written significant numbers of property casualty insurance policies 
the exclusions and limitations in our policies may not be enforceable 
many of the policies we issue include exclusions or other conditions that define and limit coverage  which exclusions and conditions are designed to manage our exposure to certain types of risks and expanding theories of legal liability 
in addition  many of our policies limit the period during which a policyholder may bring a claim under the policy  which period in many cases is shorter than the statutory period under which these claims can be brought by our policyholders 
while these exclusions and limitations help us assess and control our loss exposure  it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or limitation  or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of these exclusions and limitations 
this could result in higher than anticipated losses and lae by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increasing the number or size of claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance policies that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a policy is issued 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems and the failure or disruption of these systems could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems 
we rely on these systems to process new and renewal business  provide customer service  make claims payments and facilitate collections and cancellations  as well as to perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development 
our systems could fail of their own accord or might be disrupted by factors such as natural disasters  power disruptions or surges  computer hackers or terrorist attacks 
failure or disruption of these systems for any reason could interrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations 
cyber security risks in particular are evolving and include malicious software  unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches 
we have not experienced cyber security attacks in the past and believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our information technology systems 
however  the timing  nature and scope of cyber security attacks are difficult to predict and prevent 
therefore  we could be subject to operational delays  compromised confidential or proprietary information  destruction or corruption of data  manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks  financial losses from remedial actions and or damage to our reputation from cyber security attacks 
a cyber security attack on our information technology systems could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
global climate change may have an adverse effect on our financial statements 
although uncertainty remains as to the nature and effect of greenhouse gas emissions  we could suffer losses if global climate change results in an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters 
as with traditional natural disasters  claims arising from these incidents could increase our exposure to losses and have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations  and or financial condition

in december  hsu was informed by the texas comptroller of public accounts that a surplus lines tax audit covering the period january  through december  was complete 
hsu frequently acts as a managing general underwriter mgu authorized to underwrite policies on behalf of republic vanguard insurance company and hsic  both texas eligible surplus lines insurance carriers 
in its role as the mgu  hsu underwrites policies on behalf of these carriers while other agencies located in texas generally referred to as producing agents deliver the policies to the insureds and collect all premiums due from the insureds 
during the period under audit  the producing agents also collected the surplus lines premium taxes due on the policies from the insureds  held them in trust  and timely remitted those taxes to the comptroller 
we believe this system for collecting and paying the required surplus lines premium taxes complies in all respects with the texas insurance code and other regulations  which clearly require that the same party who delivers the policies and collects the premiums will also collect premium taxes  hold premium taxes in trust  and pay premium taxes to the comptroller 
it also complies with long standing industry practice 
the comptroller asserts that hsu is liable for the surplus lines premium taxes related to policy transactions and premiums collected from surplus lines insureds during the audit period and that hsu therefore owes million in premium taxes  as well as million in penalties and interest for the audit period 
we disagree with the comptroller and intend to vigorously fight their assertion that hsu is liable for the surplus lines premium taxes 
during the past year we have been engaged in conversations with the comptroller s counsel and are waiting on presentment of the comptroller s position paper 
at this stage  we cannot predict the course of any proceedings  the timing of any rulings or other significant events relating to such surplus lines tax audit 
given these limitations and the inherent difficulty of projecting the outcome of regulatory disputes  we are presently unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or legal costs that are likely to arise out of the surplus lines tax audit or any future proceedings relating to this matter 
therefore we have not accrued any amount as of december  related to this matter 
we are engaged in various legal proceedings that are routine in nature and incidental to our business 
none of these proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  are believed  in our opinion  to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or our results of operations

for additional discussion of our accounting policies  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
valuation of investments 
we complete a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether any decline in the fair value of any investment below cost is deemed other than temporary 
all securities with an unrealized loss are reviewed 
we recognize an impairment loss when an investment s value declines below cost  adjusted for accretion  amortization and previous other than temporary impairments and it is determined that the decline is other than temporary 
debt investments we assess whether we intend to sell  or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell  a fixed maturity investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit losses 
for fixed maturity investments that are considered other than temporarily impaired and that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell  we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related credit loss component and the amount due to all other factors 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows 
the remaining difference between the investment s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is recognized in other comprehensive income 
equity investments some of the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value for an equity investment is other than temporary include our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the recoverability of cost  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  and the financial condition and near term and long term prospects for the issuer  including the relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices 
when it is determined that an equity investment is other than temporarily impaired  the security is written down to fair value  and the amount of the impairment is included in earnings as a realized investment loss 
the fair value then becomes the new cost basis of the investment  and any subsequent recoveries in fair value are recognized at disposition 
we recognize a realized loss when impairment is deemed to be other than temporary even if a decision to sell an equity investment has not been made 
when we decide to sell a temporarily impaired available for sale equity investment and we do not expect the fair value of the equity investment to fully recover prior to the expected time of sale  the investment is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired in the period in which the decision to sell is made 
fair values of financial instruments 
accounting standards codification asc defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
asc  among other things  requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
in addition  asc precludes the use of block discounts when measuring the fair value of instruments traded in an active market  which were previously applied to large holdings of publicly traded equity securities 
we determine the fair value of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in asc in accordance with asc  we utilize the following fair value hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  inputs of identical assets for less active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the instrument  and level inputs to the valuation methodology that are unobservable for the asset or liability 
this hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available 
under asc  we determine fair value based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
it is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above 
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there exists limited or no observable market data are calculated based upon our pricing policy  the economic and competitive environment  the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors as appropriate 
these estimated fair values may not be realized upon actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability 
where quoted prices are available on active exchanges for identical instruments  investment securities are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy 
level investment securities include common stock and preferred stock 
level investment securities include corporate bonds  collateralized corporate bank loans  municipal bonds  us treasury securities  other obligations of the us government and mortgage backed securities for which quoted prices are not available on active exchanges for identical instruments 
we use a third party pricing service to determine fair values for each level investment security in all asset classes 
since quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available  these prices are determined using observable market information such as quotes from less active markets and or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics  among other things 
we have reviewed the processes used by the pricing service and have determined that they result in fair values consistent with the requirements of asc for level investment securities 
in addition  using the prices received for the securities from the third party pricing services  we compare a sample of the prices against additional sources 
we have not adjusted any prices received from third party pricing sources 
in cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation  investment securities are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy 
level investments are valued based on the best available data in order to approximate fair value 
this data may be internally developed and consider risk premiums that a market participant would require 
investment securities classified within level include other less liquid investment securities 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
policy acquisition costs mainly commission  underwriting and marketing expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts are deferred and charged to operations over periods in which the related premiums are earned 
ceding commissions from reinsurers  which include expense allowances  are deferred and recognized over the period premiums are earned for the underlying policies reinsured 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
a premium deficiency exists if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and expected investment income on those unearned premiums  as computed on a product line basis 
we routinely evaluate the realizability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
at december  and  there was no premium deficiency related to deferred policy acquisition costs 
goodwill 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill of acquired businesses of million that is assigned to our business units as follows standard commercial p c business unit million  e s commercial business unit million  general aviation business unit million  personal lines business unit million  and excess umbrella business unit million 
this amount has been recorded as a result of prior business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
we completed our last annual test for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no impairment 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
as required by asc  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
under asc  fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
the determination of fair value was based on an income approach utilizing discounted cash flows 
the valuation methodology utilized is subject to key judgments and assumptions 
estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
declines in estimated fair value could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
the income approach to determining fair value computed the projections of the cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate converted into a present value equivalent through discounting 
significant assumptions in the income approach model include income projections  discount rates and terminal growth values 
the income projections reflect an improved premium pricing environment across most of our lines of business that began in the income projections also include loss and lae assumptions which reflect recent historical claim trends and the movement towards a more favorable pricing environment 
the income projections also include assumptions for expense growth and investment yields which are based on business plans for each of our business units 
the discount rate was based on a risk free rate plus a beta adjusted equity risk premium and specific company risk premium 
the assumptions were based on historical experience  expectations of future performance  expected market conditions and other factors requiring judgment and estimates 
while we believe the assumptions used in these models were reasonable  the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and market conditions may change over time and influence the outcome of future testing 
the fair values of each of our business units were in excess of their respective carrying values  including goodwill  as a result of our annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter however  a decline in the fair value of our standard commercial p c business unit  a decline in the fair value of our e s commercial business unit  a decline in the fair value of our personal lines business unit  a decline in the fair value of our general aviation business unit  or a decline in the fair value of our excess umbrella business unit would have caused the carrying value of the respective business unit to be in excess of its fair value  resulting in the need to perform the second step of impairment testing prescribed by asc  which could have resulted in an impairment to our goodwill 
the market capitalization of hallmark s common stock has been below book value during we consider our market capitalization in assessing the reasonableness of the fair values estimated for our business units in connection with our goodwill impairment testing 
we believe the current market displacement caused by global financial market conditions  including the european sovereign credit crisis  as well as the limited daily trading volume of hallmark shares has resulted in a decrease in our market capitalization that is not representative of a long term decrease in value 
the valuation analysis discussed above supports our view that goodwill was not impaired at october  through december   there were no indicators of impairment 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our business units were reasonable  actual results could vary materially 
if our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value  we may be required to perform the second step of impairment testing prescribed by asc in future periods and impairment of goodwill could result 
we cannot predict future events that might impact the fair value of our business units and goodwill impairment 
such events include  but are not limited to  increased competition in insurance markets and global economic changes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
deferred federal income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method  whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for tax rate changes 
a valuation allowance is provided against our deferred tax assets to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be adequate to realize these future tax benefits 
reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
reserves for unpaid losses and lae are established for claims that have already been incurred by the policyholder but which we have not yet paid 
unpaid losses and lae represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through each balance sheet date 
the reserves for unpaid losses and lae are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses 
these reserves are revised periodically and are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency 
see item business analysis of losses and lae and analysis of loss and lae reserve development 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that our reserves for unpaid losses and lae are adequate 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating unpaid losses and lae  the actual ultimate amounts may differ from the recorded amounts 
a small percentage change could result in a material effect on reported earnings 
for example  a change in december  reserves for unpaid losses and lae would have produced a million change to pretax earnings 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known 
such adjustments are included in current operations 
an actuarial range of ultimate unpaid losses and lae is developed independent of management s best estimate and is only used to assess the reasonableness of that estimate 
there is no exclusive method for determining this range  and judgment enters into the process 
the primary actuarial technique utilized is a loss development analysis in which ultimate losses are projected based upon historical development patterns 
the primary assumption underlying this loss development analysis is that the historical development patterns will be a reasonable predictor of the future development of losses for accident years which are less mature 
an alternate actuarial technique  known as the bornhuetter ferguson method  combines an analysis of loss development patterns with an initial estimate of expected losses or loss ratios 
this approach is most useful for recent accident years 
in addition to assuming the stability of loss development patterns  this technique is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the initial estimate of expected losses or loss ratios 
consequently  the bornhuetter ferguson method is primarily used to confirm the results derived from the loss development analysis 
the range of unpaid losses and lae estimated by our actuary as of december  was million to million 
our best estimate of unpaid losses and lae as of december  is million 
our carried reserve for unpaid losses and lae as of december  is comprised of million in case reserves and million in incurred but not reported reserves 
in setting this estimate of unpaid losses and lae  we have assumed  among other things  that current trends in loss frequency and severity will continue and that the actuarial analysis was empirically valid 
we have established a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae  which is approximately million higher than the midpoint or of the high end of the actuarial range at december  as compared to million above the midpoint or of the high end of the actuarial range at december  we expect our best estimate to move within the actuarial range from year to year due to changes in our operations and changes within the marketplace 
due to the inherent uncertainty in reserve estimates  there can be no assurance that the actual losses ultimately experienced will fall within the actuarial range 
however  because of the breadth of the actuarial range  we believe that it is reasonably likely that actual losses will fall within such range 
our reserve requirements are also interrelated with product pricing and profitability 
we must price our products at a level sufficient to fund our policyholder benefits and still remain profitable 
because claim expenses represent the single largest category of our expenses  inaccuracies in the assumptions used to estimate the amount of such benefits can result in our failing to price our products appropriately and to generate sufficient premiums to fund our operations 
recognition of profit sharing commissions 
profit sharing commission is calculated and recognized when the loss ratio  as determined by a qualified actuary  deviates from contractual targets 
we receive a provisional commission as policies are produced as an advance against the later determination of the profit sharing commission actually earned 
the profit sharing commission is an estimate that varies with the estimated loss ratio and is sensitive to changes in that estimate 
the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity of the standard commercial p c business unit to the actual ultimate loss ratio for each effective quota share treaty at above and below the current estimate  which we believe is a reasonably likely range of variance in thousands 
treaty effective dates provisional loss ratio estimated ultimate loss ratio recorded at december  effect of actual above estimated loss ratio at december  effect of actual below estimated loss ratio at december  the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity of the e s commercial business unit for each effective quota share treaty at above and below the current estimate  which we believe is a reasonably likely range of variance in thousands 
treaty effective dates provisional loss ratio estimated ultimate loss ratio recorded at december  effect of actual above estimated loss ratio at december  effect of actual below estimated loss ratio at december  the workers compensation business unit earns a profit share commission on a quota share treaty effective july  the provisional loss ratio is and we recorded an estimated ultimate loss ratio of at december  the effect of a movement in the loss ratio above or below the current estimated ultimate loss ratio would result in a million adjustment to our pre tax earnings 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  management overview 
during fiscal  our total revenues were million  representing an approximately increase over the million in total revenues for fiscal the growth in revenue was primarily attributable to increased premium production and resulting earned premium driven largely from our e s commercial business unit and from the acquisition of our workers compensation business unit during the third quarter of the increase in revenue was partially offset by an adverse profit share commission revenue adjustment in our standard commercial p c business unit  combined with lower finance charges and earned premium in our personal segment due mostly to the impact of a reduction of premium written in underperforming states and products exited over the past twelve months 
further offsetting the increase in revenue was lower net realized gains for the period ended december  we reported net income attributable to hallmark of million for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  on a diluted per share basis  net income attributable to hallmark was per share for fiscal as compared to a net loss of per share for fiscal the increase in revenue for the year ended december  was complemented by decreased loss and lae due primarily to improved current accident year loss trends in our standard commercial p c business unit and personal lines business unit as well as million of favorable prior year loss development for the year ended december  as compared to million of adverse reserve development recognized during the prior year

the lower gross loss ratio for the year ended december  was primarily the result of favorable prior year development of million as compared to million of unfavorable development for the same period during the prior year  partially offset by higher current accident year claim activity due in large part to weather related losses of million 
specialty commercial segment 
the million of total revenue for the year ended december  was million higher than the million reported for this increase in revenue was due to higher net premiums earned of million due predominately to increased production in our e s commercial business unit and a new space risk specialty program entered into during the first quarter of in which we can retain up to million per risk for satellite launches 
further contributing to this increased revenue was higher net investment income of million and a lower adverse profit sharing commission adjustment of million for the year ended december  as compared to an adverse million profit share commission adjustment for the same period the prior year  partially offset by lower finance charges of million 
pre tax income for the specialty commercial segment of million was million higher than the million reported in the increase in pre tax income was primarily due to increased revenue discussed above and lower amortization of intangible assets of million and lower non controlling interest of million 
the increase in pre tax income was offset by higher loss and lae expenses of million and higher operating expenses of million 
the increase in operating expense was the combined result of i increased production related expenses of million  ii higher salary and related expenses of million  and iii increased other operating expenses of million  primarily comprised of professional services 
the specialty commercial segment reported a net loss ratio of for as compared to for the gross loss ratio before reinsurance was for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period the prior year 
the higher gross and net loss ratio was impacted by higher current accident year loss trends predominately in our commercial auto and general liability lines of business

net premium written for our personal segment increased million during the year ended december  to million compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in premium written was due mostly to the acquisition of hnic partially offset by a reduction in premium written in florida 
total revenue for the personal segment increased to million for the year ended december  from million the prior year 
higher earned premium of million was the primary reason for the increase in revenue for the period 
increased net investment income of million further contributed to this increase in revenue  partially offset by lower finance charges and commissions and fees of million 
our personal segment reported pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to pre tax loss of million for the same period of the increased revenue  as discussed above  was offset by increased losses and lae of million and increased operating expenses of million due mostly to increased production related expenses of million  increased salary and related expense of million  increased professional service fees of million and increased other operating expenses of million 
also contributing to the increase in pre tax loss was increased amortization of intangible assets of million related to the acquisition of hnic 
the personal segment reported a net loss ratio of for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period of the increase in the net loss ratio was primarily due to higher current accident year loss trends and claims developing much worse than anticipated due to rapid growth in the florida claim volume and the complexity related to florida personal injury protection claims 
the net loss ratio for our florida related business was for the year ended december   which equates to approximately of the net loss ratio reported as of december  during late and into  a number of actions were taken to address the issues in florida 
we increased prices  changed policy renewal terms  suspended new business production  significantly increased our personal lines claims department capabilities and made other increases in our claims staffing  including hiring experienced claims personnel in florida 
also contributing to the increase in the net loss ratio were higher current accident year loss trends in our legacy and expansion states  outside of florida 
we implemented rate increases and changed policy down payment requirements in the underperforming states 
we also exited certain underperforming states and closed unprofitable programs and products in order to focus on states and products where we can achieve desired returns 
the loss and lae during the year ended december  includes million of adverse prior year development as compared to million of adverse prior year development for the same period during the personal segment reported a net expense ratio of for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year 
the increase in the expense ratio is due predominately to increased production expenses related to the renewal and appointment of agents from our acquisition of hnic  increased salary and related expense and increased professional service fees 
corporate 
total revenue for corporate decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease in total revenue was due primarily to gains of million recognized on our investment portfolio for the year ended december  as compared to million of gains recognized during the same period in this decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher net investment income of million and a bargain purchase gain recorded on the acquisition of tbic holding of million reported in other income during the third quarter of corporate pre tax loss was million for the year ended december  as compared to a million pre tax loss for the same period the prior year 
the increase in pre tax loss was the result of the decreased revenue discussed above  higher salary and other related expenses of million due primarily to recent hires  higher professional fees of million and higher occupancy and related expenses of million  partially offset by a million adjustment to the expected earn out payable in conjunction with the acquisition of hnic

comparison of december  to december  on a consolidated basis  our cash and investments  excluding restricted cash and investments  at december  were million compared to million at december  cash from operating activities was the primary reason for this increase 
comparison of years ended december  and december  net cash provided by our consolidated operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to higher premiums collected during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in and a million federal income tax refund during the second quarter of cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the prior year

long term contractual obligations set forth below is a summary of long term contractual obligations as of december  amounts represent estimates of gross undiscounted amounts payable over time 
in addition  certain unpaid losses and lae are ceded to others under reinsurance contracts and are  therefore  recoverable 
such potential recoverables are not reflected in the table 
estimated payments by period in thousands total after notes payable   subordinated debt securities  interest on notes payable interest on subordinated debt securities   unpaid losses and lae    operating leases     purchase obligations    the payout pattern for unpaid losses and lae is based upon historical payment patterns and does not represent actual contractual obligations 
the timing and amount ultimately paid will likely vary from these estimates 
based on budgeted and year to date cash flow information  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our projected insurance obligations  operational expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our results of operations  except for the effect that inflation may have on interest rates and claim costs 
the effects of inflation are considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
the actual effects of inflation on results of operations are not known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation  we are exposed to the upward trend in the judicial awards for damages 
we attempt to mitigate the effects of inflation in the pricing of policies and establishing reserves for losses and lae 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that interest rate risk  credit risk and equity risk are the types of market risk to which we are principally exposed 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio consists largely of investment grade  fixed income securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the primary market risk exposure to these securities is interest rate risk 
in general  the fair value of a portfolio of fixed income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in market interest rates  while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates 
the fair value of our fixed income securities as of december  was million 
the effective duration of our portfolio as of december  was years 
should interest rates increase  our fixed income investment portfolio would be expected to decline in market value by  or million  representing the effective duration multiplied by the change in market interest rates 
conversely  a decline in interest rates would be expected to result in a  or million  increase in the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
credit risk 
an additional exposure to our fixed income securities portfolio is credit risk 
we attempt to manage the credit risk by investing primarily in investment grade securities and limiting our exposure to a single issuer 
as of december   our fixed income investments were in the following us treasury bonds  municipal bonds  collateralized corporate bank loans  corporate bonds  and asset backed 
as of december   of our fixed income securities were rated investment grade by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to reinsurers to whom we have ceded underwriting risk 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage it assumes  we remain obligated to our policyholders in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
in order to mitigate credit risk to reinsurance companies  most of our reinsurance recoverable balance as of december  is with reinsurers that have an am best rating of a or better 
equity price risk 
investments in equity securities that are subject to equity price risk made up of our portfolio as of december  the carrying values of equity securities are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported fair value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
the fair value of our equity securities as of december  was million 
the fair value of our equity securities would increase or decrease by million assuming a hypothetical increase or decrease in market prices as of the balance sheet date 
this would increase or decrease stockholders equity by 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what should be considered the best or worse case scenario
