table of contents our business is highly cyclical in nature 
the pulp business is highly cyclical in nature and markets are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance  which in turn affects prices 
pulp markets are highly competitive and are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy  industry capacity and foreign exchange rates  all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our operating results 
the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macro economic conditions and levels of industry capacity 
pulp is a commodity that is generally available from other producers 
because commodity products have few distinguishing qualities from producer to producer  competition is generally based upon price  which is generally determined by supply relative to demand 
industry capacity can fluctuate as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle production capacity or permanently close mills 
in addition  to avoid substantial cash costs in idling or closing a mill  some producers will choose to operate at a loss  sometimes even a cash loss  which can prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply 
oversupply of our products can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable pricing trends 
demand for pulp has historically been determined primarily by general global macroeconomic conditions and has been closely tied to overall business activity 
from to mid  pulp prices steadily improved 
however  the global economic crisis in the latter half of resulted in a sharp decline of pulp prices from a high of per admt to per admt at the end of pulp prices began to increase in the second half of and continued to increase to record levels through june of  before declining slightly in the fourth quarter of pulp prices again rebounded to record levels in the first half of but declined sharply in the latter part of the year  primarily due to economic uncertainty in europe and credit tightening in china 
economic uncertainty in europe and china  respectively  impacted both demand and prices 
in  list prices were on average approximately lower than at the end of  list prices for nbsk pulp were approximately in europe  in north america and in china 
accordingly  prices for pulp are driven by many factors outside our control  and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
because market conditions beyond our control determine the price for pulp  prices may fall below our cash production costs  requiring us to either incur short term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our mills 
therefore  our profitability depends on managing our cost structure  particularly raw materials which represent a significant component of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control 
if the prices of our products decline  or if prices for our raw materials increase  or both  our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our level of indebtedness could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million relates to the stendal loan facility 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our high debt levels may have important consequences for us  including  but not limited to the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  general corporate and other purposes or to fund future operations may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all  a significant amount of our operating cash flow is dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness  thereby diminishing funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and for other purposes  increasing our vulnerability to current and future adverse economic and industry conditions  a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or increase in our expenses could make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements  which could force us to modify our operations  
table of contents our leveraged capital structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage by hindering our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions or by making us vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy in general  causing us to offer debt or equity securities on terms that may not be favorable to us or our shareholders  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes and opportunities in our business and our industry  and our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal or interest due in respect of our indebtedness 
the indenture governing our senior notes and our bank credit facilities contain restrictive covenants which impose operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries 
these restrictions will affect  and in many respects will limit or prohibit  our ability to  among other things  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or enter into sale leaseback transactions  pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock or redeem or repurchase capital stock  make investments or acquisitions  create liens and enter into mergers  consolidations or transactions with affiliates 
the terms of our indebtedness also restrict our ability to sell certain assets  apply the proceeds of such sales and reinvest in our business 
certain of the agreements governing our indebtedness  including the stendal loan facility  have covenants that require us to maintain prescribed financial ratios and tests 
failure to comply with such covenants could result in events of default and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future financial and operating performance 
our performance  in turn  will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions  as well as financial  business  legislative  regulatory  industry and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our ability to meet our future debt service and other obligations  in particular the stendal loan facility  may depend in significant part on the extent to which we can implement successfully our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized 
a weakening of the global economy could adversely affect our business and financial results and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
principally  as pulp demand has historically been determined by general global macroeconomic activities  demand and prices for our product have historically decreased substantially during economic slowdowns 
additionally  restricted credit availability restrains our customers ability or willingness to purchase our products resulting in lower revenues 
depending on their severity and duration  the effects and consequences of a global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources  including our ability to raise capital  if needed  and otherwise negatively impact our business and financial results 
cyclical fluctuations in the price and supply of our raw materials could adversely affect our business 
our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs 
such fiber is cyclical in terms of both price and supply 
the cost of wood chips and pulp logs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber 
demand for these raw materials is generally determined by the volume of pulp and paper products produced globally and regionally 
since  generally higher energy prices and a focus on  and governmental initiatives related to  green or renewable energy have led to an increase in renewable energy projects in europe  including germany 
demand for wood residuals from such energy producers  combined with lower harvesting rates  has generally put upward pressure on prices for wood residuals such as wood chips in germany and its neighboring countries 
this has resulted in higher fiber costs for our german mills and such trend could continue to put further upward pressure on wood chip prices 

table of contents similarly  north american sawmill activity declined significantly during the recession  reducing the supply of chips and availability of pulp logs to our celgar mill 
additionally  north american energy producers are exploring the viability of renewable energy initiatives and governmental initiatives in this field are increasing  all of which could lead to higher demand for sawmill residual fiber  including chips 
the cyclical nature of pricing for these raw materials represents a potential risk to our profit margins if pulp producers are unable to pass along price increases to their customers or we cannot offset such costs through higher prices for our surplus energy 
we do not own any timberlands or have any long term governmental timber concessions and we currently have few long term fiber contracts at our german operations 
raw materials are available from a number of suppliers and we have not historically experienced material supply interruptions or substantial sustained price increases 
however  our requirements have increased and may continue to do so as we expand capacity through capital projects or other efficiency measures at our mills 
as a result  we may not be able to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our production requirements at prices acceptable to us during times of tight supply 
in addition  the quantity  quality and price of fiber we receive could be affected as a result of industrial disputes  material curtailments or shut down of operations by suppliers  government orders and legislation including new taxes or tariffs  weather conditions  acts of god and other events beyond our control 
an insufficient supply of fiber or reduction in the quality of fiber we receive would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition to the supply of wood fiber  we are dependent on the supply of certain chemicals and other inputs used in our production facilities 
any disruption in the supply of these chemicals or other inputs could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and could harm our reputation 
any material increase in the cost of these chemicals or other inputs could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
we sell our pulp globally  with a large percentage sold in europe  north america and asia 
the markets for pulp are highly competitive 
a number of other global companies compete in each of these markets and no company holds a dominant position 
our pulp is considered a commodity because many companies produce similar and largely standardized products 
as a result  the primary basis for competition in our markets has been price 
many of our competitors have greater resources and lower leverage than we do and may be able to adapt more quickly to industry or market changes or devote greater resources to the sale of products than we can 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be competitive in the future 
prices for our products are affected by many factors outside of our control and we have no influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
our profitability with respect to these products depends  in part  on managing our costs  particularly raw material and energy costs which represent significant components of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control 
the global pulp market has historically been characterized by considerable swings in prices which have and will result in variability in our earnings 
prices are typically denominated in us dollars 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations 
the majority of our sales are in products quoted in us dollars while most of our operating costs and expenses  other than those of the celgar mill  are incurred in euros 
in addition  all of the products sold by the celgar mill are quoted in us dollars and the celgar mill costs are primarily incurred in canadian dollars 
our results of operations and financial condition are reported in euros 
as a result  our revenues are adversely affected by a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and to the canadian dollar 
such shifts in currencies relative to the euro and the canadian dollar reduce our operating margins and the cash flow available to fund our operations and to service our debt 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents in  stendal entered into variable to fixed interest rate swaps to fix interest payments under the stendal loan facility  which has kept stendal from benefiting from the general decline in interest rates that ensued 
these derivatives are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and all unrealized gains and losses are recognized as earnings or losses for the relevant reporting periods 
we use derivatives to manage certain risk which has caused significant fluctuations in our operating results 
we use derivative instruments to limit our exposure to interest rate and pulp price fluctuations 
concurrently with entering into the stendal financing  stendal entered into variable to fixed rate interest swaps for the full term of our stendal loan facility to manage its interest rate risk exposure with respect to the full principal amount of this facility 
because we effectively fixed the rate on our stendal loan facility  the value of our derivative position moves inversely to interest rates 
we have also recently entered into fixed price pulp swap contracts with a bank 
we record unrealized gains or losses on our derivative instruments when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled 
these unrealized and realized gains and losses can materially impact our operating results for any reporting period 
if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize are not effective  we may incur losses which may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
the purpose of our derivative activity may also be considered speculative in nature  we do not use these instruments with respect to any pre set percentage of revenues or other formula  but either to augment our potential gains or reduce our potential losses depending on our perception of future economic events and developments 
we are subject to extensive environmental regulation and we could have environmental liabilities at our facilities 
our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws as well as permits  guidelines and policies 
these laws  permits  guidelines and policies govern  among other things unlawful discharges to land  air  water and sewers  waste collection  storage  transportation and disposal  hazardous waste  dangerous goods and hazardous materials and the collection  storage  transportation and disposal of such substances  the clean up of unlawful discharges  land use planning  municipal zoning  and employee health and safety 
in addition  as a result of our operations  we may be subject to remediation  clean up or other administrative orders or amendments to our operating permits  and we may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings or inquiries 
future orders  proceedings or inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental laws and land use laws and regulations are constantly changing 
new regulations or the increased enforcement of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  compliance with regulatory requirements is expensive  at times requiring the replacement  enhancement or modification of equipment  facilities or operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our profitability by offsetting any increased costs of complying with future regulatory requirements 

table of contents we are subject to liability for environmental damage at the facilities that we own or operate  including damage to neighboring landowners  residents or employees  particularly as a result of the contamination of soil  groundwater or surface water and especially drinking water 
the costs of such liabilities can be substantial 
our potential liability may include damages resulting from conditions existing before we purchased or operated these facilities 
we may also be subject to liability for any offsite environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances that we or our predecessors arranged to transport  treat or dispose of at other locations 
in addition  we may be held legally responsible for liabilities as a successor owner of businesses that we acquire or have acquired 
except for stendal  our facilities have been operating for decades and we have not done invasive testing to determine whether or to what extent environmental contamination exists 
as a result  these businesses may have liabilities for conditions that we discover or that become apparent  including liabilities arising from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners 
because of the limited availability of insurance coverage for environmental liability  any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant capital expenditures 
we may be unable to generate sufficient funds or access other sources of capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
our business is subject to risks associated with climate change and social and government responses thereto 
currently  there are differing scientific studies and opinions relating to the severity  extent and speed at which climate change is or may be occurring around the world 
as a result  we are currently unable to identify and predict all of the specific consequences of climate change on our business and operations 
to date  the potential and or perceived effects of climate change and social and government responses to it have created both opportunities  such as enhanced sales of surplus green energy  and risks for our business 
while all of the specific consequences from climate change are not yet predictable  we are subject to risks that government and social focus on and demand for carbon neutral or green energy will create greater demand for the wood residuals or fiber that is consumed by our pulp mills as part of their production process 
in addition  governmental initiatives or legislation may also increase both the demand and prices for wood residuals 
as governments pursue green energy initiatives  they may implement financial  tax  pricing or other legislated incentives for renewable energy producers that cannibalize or materially adversely affect fiber supplies for existing traditional users  such as lumber and pulp and paper producers 
such additional demand for wood residuals and or governmental initiatives may materially increase the competition and prices for wood residuals over time 
this could increase our fiber costs and or restrict our ability to acquire fiber at competitive prices or at all during times of shortages 
if our fiber costs increase and we cannot pass on these costs to our customers or offset them through higher prices for our sales of surplus energy  it will negatively affect our operating margins  results of operations and financial position 
if we cannot obtain the fiber required to operate our mills  we may have to curtail and or shut down production 
this could have a material adverse effect on operations  financial results and financial position 
other potential risks to our business from climate change include a greater susceptibility of northern softwood forest to disease  fire and insect infestation  which could diminish fiber availability  the disruption of transportation systems and power supply lines due to more severe storms  the loss of water transportation for logs and our finished goods inventories due to lower water levels  decreases in quantity and quality of processed water for our mill operations  the loss of northern softwood boreal forests in areas in sufficient proximity to our mills to competitively acquire fiber  and 
table of contents lower harvest levels decreasing the supply of harvestable timber and  as a consequence  wood residuals 
the occurrence of some or all of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations and or financial results 
our operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to maintain adequate capital resources to provide for all of our capital requirements 
our business is capital intensive and requires that we regularly incur capital expenditures to maintain our equipment  improve efficiencies and  as a result of changes to environmental regulations that require capital expenditures  bring our operations into compliance with such regulations 
in addition  our senior management and board of directors may approve projects in the future that will require significant capital expenditures 
increased capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
if our available cash resources and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to fund our operating needs and capital expenditures  we would have to obtain additional funds from borrowings or other available sources or reduce or delay our capital expenditures 
recent global credit conditions and the downturn in the global economy have resulted in a significant decline in the credit markets and the overall availability of credit 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  limit our operations and impair our ability to raise additional capital 
if this occurs  we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
if we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment as may be required from time to time  we may become unable to manufacture products that compete effectively 
an inability to make required capital expenditures in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on our growth  business  financial condition or results of operations 
future acquisitions may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business 
in order to grow our business  we may seek to acquire additional assets or companies 
our ability to pursue selective and accretive acquisitions will be dependent on management s ability to identify  acquire  and develop suitable acquisition targets in both new and existing markets  but  in certain circumstances  acceptable acquisition targets might not be available 
in pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities  we face competition from other companies having similar growth strategies  many of which may have substantially greater resources than us 
competition for these acquisitions or investment targets could result in increased acquisition or investment prices  higher risks and a diminished pool of businesses or assets available for acquisition 
acquisitions also frequently result in recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
furthermore  the costs of integrating acquired businesses including restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions  as well as other acquisition costs  such as accounting fees  legal fees and investment banking fees could significantly impact our operating results 
although we perform diligence on the businesses we purchase  in light of the circumstances of each transaction  an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses 
we may not be able to ascertain the value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired businesses and their operations until we assume operating control of the assets and operations of these businesses 
furthermore  any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of risks  including problems with the effective integration of operations  inability to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships  increased operating costs  exposure to substantial unanticipated liabilities  and difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings 

table of contents in addition  geographic and other expansions  acquisitions or joint ventures may require significant managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations 
if we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
credit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results  actions that we take  their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy 
actions taken by the rating agencies can include maintaining  upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing the company on a watch list for possible future downgrading 
downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading could limit our access to the credit markets  increase our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 
project blue mill may not generate the results or benefits we expect 
project blue mill is subject to customary risks and uncertainties inherent for large capital projects which could result in the project not completing on schedule or as budgeted 
the stendal mill could experience operating difficulties or delays during the start up period when the new mw turbine is being ramped up 
project blue mill may not increase the stendal mill s pulp production and energy generating capacity to the levels we had planned 
cost overruns  equipment breakdowns or failures to perform to design specifications could have a material adverse effect on our stendal mill s results of operations and financial performance 
we are subject to risks related to our employees 
the majority of our employees are unionized and we have collective agreements in place with our employees at all of our mills 
although we have not experienced any work stoppages in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable collective agreements or other satisfactory arrangements with our employees upon the expiration of our collective agreements 
this could result in a strike or work stoppage by the affected workers 
the registration or renewal of the collective agreements or the outcome of our wage negotiations could result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members 
accordingly  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher on going labor costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we rely on government grants and guarantees and participate in european statutory programs 
we currently benefit from a subsidized capital expenditure program and lower cost of financing as a result of german federal and state government grants and guarantees at our stendal mill 
should either the german federal or state governments be prohibited from honoring legislative grants and guarantees at stendal  or should we be required to repay any such legislative grants  this may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
since  our german mills have benefitted from sales of emission allowances under the eu ets 
as a result of our rosenthal and stendal mills eligibility for special tariffs under the renewable energy act  the amount of emissions allowances granted to our german mills under the eu ets has been reduced 
additionally  all such german legislation is subject to amendment or change which could adversely affect the eligibility of our rosenthal and stendal mills to participate in this statutory program and or the tariffs paid thereunder 
as a result we cannot predict with any certainty the amount of future sales of surplus energy we may be able to generate 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our future success depends  to a large extent  on the efforts and abilities of our executive and senior mill operating officers 
such officers are industry professionals many of whom have operated through multiple business cycles 
our officers play an integral role in  among other things sales and marketing  
table of contents reducing operating costs  identifying capital projects which provide a high rate of return  and prioritizing expenditures and maintaining employee relations 
the loss of one or more of our officers could make us less competitive in these areas which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance for any of our executive or senior mill operating officers 
we may experience material disruptions to our production 
a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our pulp and energy sales and or negatively impact our results of operations 
any of our mills could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including unscheduled maintenance outages  prolonged power failures  equipment failure  employee errors or failures  design error or employee or contractor error  chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railway tracks  tunnels  canals and ports  fires  floods  earthquakes or other natural catastrophes  prolonged supply disruption of major inputs  labor difficulties  and other operational problems 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if any of our facilities were to incur significant downtime  our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if our long lived assets become impaired  we may be required to record non cash impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
should the markets for our products deteriorate or should we decide to invest capital differently or should other cash flow assumptions change  it is possible that we will be required to record non cash impairment charges in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events  including the emergence of a pandemic  terrorist attacks or natural disasters 
the occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events  including the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency  terrorist attacks or natural 
table of contents disasters  could create economic and financial disruptions  could lead to operational difficulties including travel limitations that could impair our ability to manage or operate our business and adversely affect our results of operations 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate 
we have obtained insurance coverage that we believe would ordinarily be maintained by an operator of facilities similar to our mills 
our insurance is subject to various limits and exclusions 
damage or destruction to our facilities could result in claims that are excluded by  or exceed the limits of  our insurance coverage 
additionally  the weak global and financial markets have also reduced the availability and extent of credit insurance for our customers 
if we cannot obtain adequate credit insurance for our customers  we may be forced to amend or curtail our planned operations which could negatively impact our sales revenues  results of operations and financial position 
we rely on third parties for transportation services 
our business primarily relies upon third parties for the transportation of pulp to our customers  as well as for the delivery of our raw materials to our mills 
our pulp and raw materials are principally transported by truck  barge  rail and sea going vessels  all of which are highly regulated 
increases in transportation rates can also materially adversely affect our results of operations 
further  if our transportation providers fail to deliver our pulp in a timely manner  it could negatively impact our customer relationships and we may be unable to sell it at full value 
if our transportation providers fail to deliver our raw materials in a timely fashion  we may be unable to manufacture pulp in response to customer orders 
also  if any of our transportation providers were to cease operations  we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including those described above and the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of new products  capacity changes  significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic investments  our growth rate and our competitors growth rates  the financial market and general economic conditions  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us  our competitors or the forest products industry generally or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock  sales of common stock by our executive officers  directors and significant stockholders  and changes in accounting principles 
in addition  there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the forest products industry that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them 
if litigation of this type is brought against us  it could result in substantial costs and would divert management s attention and resources

the million rosenthal working capital facility is secured by certain land at the rosenthal mill 
the other working capital loan facilities established for the rosenthal and celgar mills are secured by first charges against the inventories and receivables at the respective mills 
item legal proceedings in october  our wholly owned subsidiary  zellstoff celgar limited  received a re assessment for real property transfer tax payable in british columbia  canada  in the amount of approximately million c million in connection with the acquisition of the celgar mill 
we are currently contesting the re assessment and we currently expect the supreme court of british columbia to hold a hearing on this matter in the reassessment has been fully paid and the amount  if any  that may be reimbursed to us in connection with this matter remains uncertain 
in september of  the celgar mill received a letter from the upper columbia river natural resources trustee council  an organization consisting of aboriginal groups and us government representatives  referred to as the council  alleging that  based on their preliminary assessment the preliminary assessment  between to  the celgar mill had discharged chlorinated organic compounds into the columbia river 
the preliminary assessment was conducted to evaluate the need to conduct a formal natural resource damage assessment under the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  referred to as cercla 
although we did not acquire the celgar mill until  and the celgar mill s alleged discharges occurred prior to our acquisition of the mill  the council determined to proceed with a formal natural resource damage assessment under the cercla 
although at this time it is unclear as to whether any harm was caused by these alleged discharges and  in any event  we do not believe we are liable  due to the preliminary nature of the assessment  we cannot at this time quantify the costs  if any  associated with this matter 
in january  we served a notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration on the government of canada  referred to as the nafta notice  for breaches by it of its obligations under the north american free trade agreement  referred to as nafta 
the company s nafta claim  referred to as the nafta claim  relates to its investments in the celgar mill and arises from the treatment of the celgar mill s energy generation assets and operations by the province of british columbia  primarily through the actions of bc hydro  a provincially owned and controlled enterprise  and the british columbia utilities commission  a provincial government regulatory agency 
our nafta claim is against the government of canada  rather than the province of british columbia as  under nafta  the canadian federal government is responsible for the actions of its provinces 
our nafta claim alleges that our celgar mill has received unfair and discriminatory treatment regarding the mill s ability to purchase and sell energy compared to other pulp mills and entities that generate and sell electricity within the province of british columbia 
subsequent to the filing of the nafta notice  our representatives met with representatives of the government of canada and the province of british columbia to attempt to settle our nafta claim through consultation and negotiation  as required under nafta article however  no resolution was achieved 
as a result  we served a request for arbitration on the government of canada under nafta in order to meet the applicable filing deadline and to preserve and progress our nafta claim 
under our nafta claim  we are seeking approximately c million in damages consisting of past losses of approximately c million per year accruing since and the net present value of projected losses that would result from the ongoing application of discriminatory provincial policies should the status quo remain 
table of contents unchanged 
our nafta claim is being instituted under chapter of nafta and will be heard by a tribunal appointed in accordance with article of nafta 
at this time  there can be no assurance whether we will be successful in such claim and we cannot quantify the amount we may recover  if any  under such proceedings if we were successful 
in  as a result of a regular tax field audit for the stendal mill  german public authorities commenced a preliminary investigation into a past and the current managers of the mill relating to whether certain settlement amounts received by the stendal mill in  and from the main contractor under the engineering  procurement and construction contract for the construction of the stendal mill should have reduced the assessment base for the original investment subsidies granted to the mill by german authorities 
the payments were made by the contractor to the stendal mill to settle certain warranty  performance and remediation claims that the stendal mill made against the contractor after completion of mill construction in the amounts currently under review aggregate approximately million 
investment subsidies received by the stendal mill were generally based upon a percentage of the assessment base for subsidies of the mill 
if the settlement payments received by the stendal mill result in a reduction of the assessment base for subsidies under applicable german rules there could be a proportionate reduction in the investment subsidies and the difference could be repayable by the stendal mill 
the stendal mill believes that it has properly recorded the settlement amounts received from the contractor and that the same do not reduce the assessment base for subsidies of the mill 
however  at this time  there can be no certainty as to the outcome of the current investigation 
we are also subject to routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not believe that the outcome of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations for the years ended december   and is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward looking statements 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
results of operations general we operate in the pulp business and our operations are located in germany and western canada 
our mills have a current combined annual production capacity of approximately million admts of nbsk pulp and mw of electrical generation 
markets for nbsk pulp are global  cyclical and commodity based 
our financial performance depends on a number of variables that impact sales and production costs 
sales and production results for kraft pulp are influenced largely by the market price for nbsk pulp  fiber costs and foreign currency exchange rates 
kraft pulp markets are highly cyclical  with prices determined by supply and demand 
in general  kraft pulp is a globally traded commodity 
pricing and demand are influenced by the balance between supply and demand  as affected by global macroeconomic conditions  changes in consumption and industry capacity  the level of customer and producer inventories and fluctuations in exchange rates 
the average european list prices for nbsk pulp between and ranged from a low of per admt in to a high of  per admt in in  the supply demand balance for softwood market pulp improved due to strong demand in china and supply reductions resulting from the closure of several older mills and the residual effect of earthquakes in chile 
during the year  several increases lifted prices to record levels in the middle of the year 
although pulp list prices continued to increase through the first half of  economic uncertainty in europe and credit tightening in china resulted in a decline in pulp prices commencing in the fourth quarter of in  there was continuing economic uncertainty in europe and credit tightening in china in the first half of the year 
further  in the latter part of  weak demand for paper in europe resulted in some integrated producers curtailing their paper production and selling their pulp on the market  primarily in china 
these factors negatively impacted demand and supply and list prices for nbsk pulp 
on average  nbsk list prices in europe were down approximately in compared to at the end of  list prices were approximately in europe and and in north america and china  respectively  at the end of our sales realizations are list prices  net of customer discounts  commissions and other selling concessions 
our reported average sale price realizations are affected by nbsk price movements between the order and shipment dates 
surplus energy and chemicals are by products of our pulp production and the volumes generated and sold are primarily related to the rate of pulp production 
prices for our energy and chemical sales are generally stable and unrelated to cyclical changes in pulp prices 
production and sales of surplus energy and chemicals are key revenue sources for us 
in  and  our mills generated  mwh   mwh and  mwh  respectively  of surplus energy  primarily from a renewable carbon neutral source 
initiatives to increase our generation and sales of surplus renewable energy and chemicals will continue to be a key focus for us 
project blue mill at our stendal mill is expected to both increase pulp production and efficiencies through debottlenecking and increase surplus electricity production by approximately  mwh 
further initiatives to increase energy generation and chemical sales may require additional capital spending 

table of contents our production costs are influenced by the availability and cost of raw materials  energy and labor  and our plant efficiencies and productivity 
our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs 
wood chip and pulp log costs are primarily affected by the supply of  and demand for  lumber and pulp  which are both highly cyclical 
higher fiber costs could affect producer profit margins if they are unable to pass along price increases to pulp customers or purchasers of surplus energy 
overall weak lumber markets in  and most of resulted in reduced sawmill activity and log harvesting in the regional fiber baskets for our mills 
this has reduced the supply of both wood residuals such as chips and pulp logs 
this cyclical supply reduction put upward pressure on fiber prices 
additionally  higher energy prices and a focus on green or renewable energy  while benefiting our surplus power sales  has also led to an overall increase in demand for wood residuals from other renewable energy producers such as pellet producers 
a recovery in us housing starts which commenced in the latter part of has resulted in increased sawmill activity and is expected to increase the supply of woodchips for the celgar mill 
production costs also depend on the total volume of production 
high operating rates and production efficiencies permit us to lower our average cost by spreading fixed costs over more units 
higher operating rates also permit us to increase our generation and sales of surplus renewable energy and chemicals 
our production levels are also dependent on  among other things  the number of days of scheduled and unscheduled downtime at our mills 
unexpected production downtime  which has not materially affected us during any of the periods described in this discussion  can be particularly disruptive in our industry 
our product mix is also important because premium grades of nbsk pulp generally achieve higher prices and profit margins 
our financial performance for any reporting period is impacted by changes in the us dollar to euro and canadian dollar exchange rates and in interest rates 
changes in currency rates affect our operating results because the price for our principal product  nbsk pulp  is generally based on a global industry benchmark that is quoted in us dollars  even though a significant portion of the sales from our german mills is invoiced in euros and we report our results in euros 
therefore  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar will generally reduce the amount of our pulp operations revenues 
most of our operating costs at our german mills  including our debt obligations under the stendal loan facility  are incurred in euros 
most of our operating costs at the celgar mill  including the mill s working capital facility  are in canadian dollars 
these costs do not fluctuate with the us dollar to euro or canadian dollar exchange rates 
thus  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar tends to reduce our sales revenue  gross profit and income from operations 
conversely  an increase in the us dollar versus the euro and the canadian dollar positively impacts our revenues and increases our operating margins and cash flow 
we also periodically enter into interest rate  foreign currency  pulp price and energy price derivative contracts to partially protect against the effect of such changes 
gains or losses on such derivatives are included in our earnings  either as they are settled or as they are marked to market for each reporting period 
stendal  as required under the stendal loan facility  entered into variable to fixed rate interest swaps  referred to as the stendal interest rate swap contract  in august to fix the interest rate on such indebtedness for the full term of the stendal loan facility 
changes in long term interest rates result in our recording unrealized non cash gains or losses on the stendal interest rate swap contract when it is marked to market on a quarterly basis 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
significant actions in  we took the following significant actions commenced project blue mill at our stendal mill 
the project is expected to increase the mill s production of pulp and green energy 
when completed in the latter part of  it should further enhance our stable stream of income from energy and chemical sales  completed an upgrade to the rosenthal mill s recovery boiler in the second quarter of to reduce the mill s emissions  increase production capacity and lower operating costs  and 
table of contents continued to improve mill operations and efficiencies  which allowed us to achieve record annual pulp production and energy generation 
current market environment economic uncertainty in europe and china negatively impacted demand and list prices for nbsk pulp through in the fourth quarter of  although supply and demand were balanced  prices were generally stagnant with only modest price increases 
we believe that the market is currently balanced and we currently expect that a modest price recovery will continue in as pulp prices are highly cyclical  there can be no assurance that prices will not decline in the future

year ended december  compared to year ended december  in the year ended december   pulp revenues decreased by approximately to million from million in  primarily due to lower average pulp sales realizations  partially offset by higher pulp sales volumes and a stronger us dollar relative to the euro 
in  there was continuing economic uncertainty in europe and credit tightening in china in the first half of the year 
further  in the latter part of  weak demand for paper in europe resulted in some integrated producers curtailing their paper production and selling their pulp on the market  primarily in china 
these factors negatively impacted demand and supply and list prices for nbsk pulp 
nbsk pulp prices remained relatively stable during the first quarter of before decreasing in the middle part of the year and were generally stagnant in the latter part of in  surplus energy and chemicals sales increased by approximately to an annual record of million from million in  primarily as a result of record pulp production 
in  tall oil  which had previously been classified as an offset to operating costs  has been included with revenues as we currently expect proceeds from the sale of tall oil to remain stable in future periods 
list prices for nbsk pulp in europe averaged approximately per admt in  compared to per admt in at the end of  list prices were per admt in europe and and per admt in north america and china  respectively 
average pulp sales realizations decreased by approximately to per admt in from per admt in  primarily due to lower pulp prices  only partially offset by a stronger us dollar relative to the euro 
at the end of  reported global inventories for softwood kraft were approximately days supply  while at the end of inventories for softwood kraft were approximately days supply 
pulp sales volume increased by approximately to a record  admts in from  admts in  primarily as a result of increased sales to china in pulp production increased to a record level of  admts in from  admts in  primarily due to increased pulp production at our stendal and celgar mills 
in and  we took a total of and days scheduled maintenance downtime  respectively  at our mills and expect to take approximately days in costs and expenses marginally decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in  primarily due to lower fiber costs  partially offset by higher pulp sales volumes in our costs and expenses in included approximately million for regularly scheduled maintenance costs  compared to million in several competing producers and members of the peer group that we benchmark our performance against now report their financial results in accordance with international financial reporting standards which permit a significant portion of such maintenance costs to be capitalized instead of expensed 
such costs are not charged to ebitda by the peer group companies but instead are expensed as depreciation 
on average  in  our per unit fiber costs decreased by approximately compared to  primarily due to lower fiber costs in germany caused by decreased demand from the european particle board industry and other regional residual fiber users 
fiber costs at our celgar mill were higher  primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange changes more than offsetting improved wood chip availability for the region 
we currently expect fiber costs at our german mills to increase slightly in the short to mid term  primarily due to higher demand from pellet and board producers which has been compounded by winter weather conditions limiting wood supply  though we expect these costs to be partially offset by price decreases in canada as a result of strong sawmill activity in british columbia 

table of contents operating depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in selling  general and administrative expenses marginally decreased to million in from million in for the year ended december   operating income decreased to million from million in  primarily due to lower average pulp sales realizations  partially offset by a stronger us dollar relative to the euro and lower fiber costs 
interest expense in decreased to million from million in  primarily due to reduced debt levels associated with our stendal mill and the conversion of our remaining convertible notes in transportation costs increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of higher sales volumes and the impact of foreign exchange on our shipments from celgar 
in  we recorded an unrealized gain of million on the stendal interest rate swap contract  compared to an unrealized loss of million in  which was primarily the result of an increase in short term european interest rates 
we entered into various fixed pulp swap contracts with a bank in under the first contract   metric tonnes  referred to as mt  of pulp per month was fixed at a price of per mt for each month between may and december of under contracts entered into in november   mt of pulp per month is fixed at prices ranging from to per mt per month and expire in december we recorded a gain of approximately million related to these swap contracts during the year ended december  a portion of our long term debt is denominated and repayable in foreign currencies  principally us dollars 
in  we recorded neither a foreign exchange loss or gain on our debt  compared to a gain of million in we recorded losses on the extinguishment of debt of million in each of and  primarily in connection with the purchase and extinguishment of some of our outstanding senior notes 
in  the noncontrolling shareholder s proportionate interest in the stendal mill s income was million  compared to million in in  deferred tax recoveries were million  compared to deferred tax recoveries of million in  primarily due to the timing of recognizing deferred tax assets based on forecasted income 
in  we reported net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share 
this included an unrealized non cash gain of million on stendal interest rate derivatives and a realized gain of million and an unrealized gain of million on pulp price derivatives 
in  we reported net income of million  or per basic and per diluted share 
this included a non cash loss of million on our stendal interest rate swap contract 
in  operating ebitda decreased to million from million in operating ebitda is defined as operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization and non recurring capital asset impairment charges 
management uses operating ebitda as a benchmark measurement of its own operating results  and as a benchmark relative to its competitors 
management considers it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because depreciation expense and non recurring capital asset impairment charges are not an actual cash cost  and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that management considers largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities 
in addition  we believe operating ebitda is commonly used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance 

table of contents operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income loss attributable to common shareholders  including financing costs and the effect of derivative instruments 
operating ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  referred to as gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or income loss from operations as a measure of performance  nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
operating ebitda has significant limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are that operating ebitda does not reflect i our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ii changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital needs  iii the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our outstanding debt  iv noncontrolling interest on our stendal nbsk pulp mill operations  v the impact of realized or marked to market changes in our derivative positions  which can be substantial  and vi operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of impairment charges against our investments or assets 
because of these limitations  operating ebitda should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
see the statement of cash flows set out in our consolidated financial statements included herein 
because all companies do not calculate operating ebitda in the same manner  operating ebitda as calculated by us may differ from operating ebitda or ebitda as calculated by other companies 
we compensate for these limitations by using operating ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance and by relying primarily on our gaap financial statements

nbsk pulp is a global commodity that is priced in us dollars  whose markets are highly competitive and cyclical in nature 
as a result  our earnings are sensitive to nbsk pulp price changes 
based upon our sales volume and assuming all other factors remained constant  each per tonne change in nbsk pulp prices yields a change in operating ebitda of approximately million 
foreign exchange 
as nbsk pulp is principally quoted in us dollars  the amount of revenues we generate fluctuates with changes in the value of the us dollar to the euro 
based upon our revenues  each change in the value of the us dollar yields a change in annual gross sales revenue of approximately million 
seasonal influences 
we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these factors are common in the nbsk pulp industry 
we generally have weaker pulp demand in europe during the summer holiday months and in china in the period relating to its lunar new year 
we typically have a seasonal build up in raw material inventories in the early winter months as the mills build up their fiber supply for the winter when there is reduced availability

we operate in a cyclical industry and our operating cash flows vary accordingly 
our principal operating cash expenditures are for labor  fiber  chemicals and debt service 
working capital levels fluctuate throughout the year and are affected by maintenance downtime  changing sales patterns  seasonality and the timing of receivables and the payment of payables and expenses 
generally  finished goods inventories are increased prior to scheduled maintenance downtime to maintain sales volume while production is stopped 
our fiber inventories exhibit seasonal swings as we increase pulp log and wood chip inventories to ensure adequate supply of fiber to our mills during the winter months 
changes in sales volume can affect the level of receivables and influence overall working capital levels

sources and uses of funds our principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand and the revolving working capital loan facilities for our celgar and rosenthal mills 
our principal uses of funds consist of operating expenditures  payments of principal and interest on the stendal loan facility  capital expenditures and interest payments on our outstanding senior notes 
as at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  compared to cash and cash equivalents and short term german federal government bonds aggregating million at the end of as at december   we had approximately million and c million available under our rosenthal and celgar facilities  respectively

in  we committed to implementing project blue mill at a cost of million  which will primarily be funded through million of non refundable german government grants and the million blue mill facility 
the balance of project blue mill will be funded through operating cash flow of the stendal mill and up to an aggregate million in pro rata shareholder loans from us and stendal s noncontrolling shareholder 
as at december   other then planned capital expenditures  we had no material commitments to acquire assets or operating businesses 
based upon the current level of operations and our current expectations for future periods in light of the current economic environment  and in particular  current and expected pulp pricing and foreign exchange rates  we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under our celgar working capital facility and rosenthal loan facility  will be adequate to meet the future liquidity needs during the next months 
in the future we may make acquisitions of businesses or assets or commitments to additional capital projects 
to achieve the long term goals of expanding our assets and earnings  including through acquisitions  capital resources will be required 
depending on the size of a transaction  the capital resources that will be required can be substantial 
the necessary resources will be generated from cash flow from operations  cash on hand  borrowing against our assets or the issuance of securities

certain of our long term obligations contain various financial tests and covenants customary to these types of arrangements 
the stendal loan facility contains an annual debt service cover ratio which  pursuant to the terms of the amendment  must not fall below x for the period from december  to december  and x for the period after january  until maturity on september  the amendment also implements a permitted leverage ratio of total debt to ebitda which is effective from december  this ratio is set to decline over time from x on its effective date to x on june  failure to comply with either ratio constitutes an event of default  but may be cured by the shareholders of stendal with a once per fiscal year ratio deficiency cure through a capital contribution or subordinated loan in the amount necessary to cure such deficiency 
the stendal blue mill facility requires the stendal mill to maintain similar debt service and leverage ratios as the stendal loan facility and contains similar cure provisions

principally comprised of german federal government bonds with a maturity of less than one year 
sources and uses of funds of the restricted group the restricted group s principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand and the revolving working capital loan facilities for our celgar and rosenthal mills 
the restricted group s principal uses of funds consist of operating expenditures  capital expenditures and interest payments on our outstanding senior notes 
as at december   the restricted group s cash and cash equivalents were million  compared to cash and cash equivalents and short term german federal government bonds aggregating million at the end of as at december   we had million available under the credit facilities related to the rosenthal mill and c million under the celgar working capital facility 
in  excluding amounts being financed by governmental grants  we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately million  primarily for various small projects at the rosenthal and celgar mills 
we expect the restricted group to meet its interest and debt service obligations and meet the working and maintenance capital requirements for its current operations from cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand  the rosenthal loan facility and the celgar working capital facility 
in the future we may make acquisitions of businesses or assets or commitments to additional projects 
to achieve the long term goals of expanding our assets and earnings  including through acquisitions  capital resources will be required 
depending on the size of a transaction  the capital resources that will be required can be substantial 
the necessary resources will be generated from cash flow from operations  cash on hand  borrowing against our assets or the issuance of securities 
credit ratings of senior notes standard poor s rating services  referred to as s p  and moody s investors service  inc  referred to as moody s  base their assessment of the credit risk on our senior notes on the business and financial profile of the restricted group only 
factors that may affect our credit rating include changes in our operating performance and liquidity 
credit rating downgrades can adversely impact  among other things  future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 

table of contents during the second quarter of  we were subject to improved rating actions by s p 
in july  s p raised its ratings on the senior notes to b from b and improved its recovery rating from to 
the improved ratings reflect our balance sheet deleveraging in the first half of and s p s belief that demand for nbsk pulp should remain robust and that our liquidity position should continue to improve

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the amount and the timing of recording of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying note disclosures 
our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our audited annual consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annual report 
while all of the significant accounting policies are important to the consolidated financial statements  some of these policies may be viewed as having a high degree of judgment 
on an ongoing basis using currently available information  management reviews its estimates  including those related to accounting for  among other things  doubtful accounts and reserves  depreciation and amortization  future cash flows associated with impairment testing for long lived assets  derivative financial instruments  environmental conservation and legal liabilities  asset retirement obligations  pensions and post retirement benefit obligations  income taxes  contingencies  and inventory obsolescence and provisions 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the following accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and are subject to a fair degree of measurement uncertainty 
derivative instruments 
we occasionally enter into derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  electricity forward contracts  interest rate swaps and pulp price swaps to limit exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  energy prices  interest rates  and pulp prices 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments 
derivative instruments are measured at fair value and reported in our balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the change in fair value of electricity derivative contracts is included in operating costs in our consolidated statement of operations and any changes in the fair value of foreign currency  interest rate and pulp price derivative contracts are recognized in gain loss on derivative instruments in our consolidated statement of operations 
periodically  we enter into derivative contracts to supply materials for our own use  which are exempt from mark to market accounting 
in  we reported an unrealized non cash holding gain of million before noncontrolling interest in respect of the stendal interest rate swap contract and our pulp price swap contracts 
impairment of long lived assets 
we state property  plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of buildings and production equipment is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets and is computed using the straight line method 
buildings are depreciated over to years and production equipment and other primarily over years 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management to make subjective 
table of contents judgments 
in addition  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity of the assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
our management considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  actual impairment losses could vary materially  either positively or negatively  from estimated impairment losses 
the costs of major rebuilds  replacements and those expenditures that substantially increase the useful lives of existing property  plant  and equipment are capitalized  as well as interest costs associated with major capital projects until ready for their intended use 
the cost of repairs and maintenance as well as planned shutdown maintenance performed on manufacturing facilities  composed of labor  materials and other incremental costs  is charged to operations as incurred 
leases which transfer to us substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item are capitalized at the present value of the minimum lease payments 
capital leases are depreciated over the lease term 
operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations on a straight line basis over the lease term 
we provide for asset retirement obligations when there is a legislated or contractual basis for those obligations 
obligations are recorded as a liability at fair value  with a corresponding increase to property  plant  and equipment  and are amortized over the remaining useful life of the related assets 
the liability is accreted using a risk free interest rate 
as a result of current market conditions  we concluded that there were no impairment indicators 
accordingly  we did not undertake a long lived asset impairment review in deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred tax assets which are comprised primarily of tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  both of which will reduce taxable income in the future 
the amounts recorded for deferred tax are based upon various judgments  assumptions and estimates 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a periodic basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized  based on currently available information  including  but not limited to  the following the history of the tax loss carryforwards and their expiry dates  future reversals of temporary differences  our historical and projected earnings  and tax planning opportunities 
if we believe that it is more likely than not that some of these deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on currently available information  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets 
additionally  based on guidance noted in fasb accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  tax assets are not permitted to be recognized where the entity does not have a strong history of profitability 
as at december   we had million in deferred tax assets and million in deferred tax liabilities  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
our tax assets are net of a million valuation allowance 
for the year ended december   our review concluded that it was appropriate to increase the valuation allowance against loss carryforwards by approximately million  after considering expected future earnings and reversals of temporary differences 
if market conditions improve or tax planning opportunities arise in the future  we will reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax benefits 
if market conditions deteriorate in the future  we will increase our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax expenses 
any change in tax laws will change the valuation allowances in future periods 

table of contents government grants 
we record investment grants from federal and state governments when the conditions of their receipt are complied with and there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received 
grants related to assets are government grants whose primary condition is that the company qualifying for them should purchase  construct or otherwise acquire long term assets 
secondary conditions may also be attached  including restricting the type or location of the assets and or other conditions that must be met 
grants related to assets are deducted from the asset costs in our balance sheet 
grants related to income are government grants which are either unconditional  related to reduced environmental emissions or related to our normal business operations  and are reported as a reduction of related expenses in our consolidated statement of operations when received 
we are required to pay certain fees based on water consumption levels at our german mills 
unpaid fees can be reduced by wastewater grants upon the mills demonstration of reduced environmental emissions 
the fees are expensed as incurred and the grants are recognized once the german regulators have evaluated and accepted the measurement of the wastewater emission reduction 
there may be a significant period of time between recognition of the wastewater expense and recognition of the wastewater grant 
to the extent that government grants have been received and not applied  these grants are recorded in cash with a corresponding adjustment to accounts payable and other in our consolidated balance sheet due to the short term nature of the related payments 
foreign operations and currency translation 
we translate foreign assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries  other than those denominated in euros  at the rate of exchange at our balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange throughout the year 
transaction gains and losses related to net assets primarily located in canada are recognized as unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity  until all of the investment in the subsidiaries is sold or liquidated 
the translation adjustments do not recognize the effect of income tax when we expect earnings of the foreign subsidiary to be indefinitely reinvested 
the income tax effect on currency translation adjustments related to foreign subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested is recorded as a component of deferred taxes in our consolidated balance sheet with an offset to other comprehensive income 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are included in costs and expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
where inter company loans are of a long term investment nature  the after tax effect of exchange rate changes are included as an unrealized foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
inventory provisions 
inventories of nbsk pulp and logs and wood chips are valued at the lower of cost  using the weighted average cost method  or net realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value based on future cash flows expected to result from the sale of our product nbsk pulp 
the cash flows are estimated based on the expected time it will take to exhaust the respective inventory  including estimates of additional costs that will need to be incurred to bring that inventory to a salable state 
the future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management to make subjective judgments 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows  actual inventory provisions could vary materially  either positively or negatively  from estimated inventory provisions 
as at december   we did not record an inventory provision against any of our finished goods and raw materials inventories 
environmental conservation 
liabilities for environmental conservation are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and their fair value can be reasonably estimated 
any potential recoveries of such liabilities are recorded when there is an agreement with the reimbursing entity and recovery is assessed as likely to occur 

table of contents cautionary statement regarding forward looking information the statements in this annual report on form k that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended 
these statements appear in a number of different places in this report and can be identified by words such as estimates  projects  expects  intends  believes  plans  or their negatives or other comparable words 
also look for discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements include statements regarding the outlook for our future operations  forecasts of future costs and expenditures  the evaluation of market conditions  the outcome of legal proceedings  the adequacy of reserves  or other business plans 
you are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees and may involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements due to risks facing us or due to actual facts differing from the assumptions underlying our estimates 
some of these risks and assumptions include those set forth in reports and other documents we have filed with or furnished to the sec  including in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  we advise you that these cautionary remarks expressly qualify in their entirety all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf

inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on revenues or income during 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar and the euro 
changes in these rates may affect our results of operations and financial condition and  consequently  our fair value 
we seek to manage these risks through internal risk management policies as well as the use of derivatives 
we use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to interest rate and currency risks 
we also use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to fluctuations in pulp prices 
we use derivatives to reduce our potential losses or to augment our potential gains  depending on our management s perception of future economic events and developments 
these types of derivatives are generally highly speculative in nature 
they are also very volatile as they are highly leveraged given that margin requirements are relatively low in proportion to notional amounts 
many of our strategies  including the use of derivatives  and the types of derivatives selected by us  are based on historical trading patterns and correlations and our management s expectations of future events 
however  these strategies may not be effective in all market environments or against all types of risks 
unexpected market developments may affect our risk management strategies during this time  and unanticipated developments could impact our risk management strategies in the future 
if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize is not effective  we may incur significant losses 
derivatives derivatives are contracts between two parties where payments between the parties are dependent upon movements in the price of an underlying asset  index or financial rate 
examples of derivatives include swaps  options and forward rate agreements 
the notional amount of the derivatives is the contract amount used as a reference point to calculate the payments to be exchanged between the two parties and the notional amount itself is not generally exchanged by the parties 
the principal derivatives we use are foreign exchange derivatives  interest rate derivatives  pulp price derivatives and energy derivatives 
foreign exchange derivatives include currency swaps which involve the exchange of fixed payments in one currency for the receipt of fixed payments in another currency 
such cross currency swaps involve the exchange of both interest and principal amounts in two different currencies 
they also include foreign exchange forwards which are contractual obligations in which two counterparties agree to exchange one currency for another at a specified price for settlement at a pre determined future date 
forward contracts are effectively tailor made agreements that are transacted between counterparties in the over the counter market 
interest rate derivatives include interest rate forwards forward rate agreements which are contractual obligations to buy or sell an interest rate sensitive financial instrument on a future date at a specified price 
they also include interest rate swaps which are over the counter contracts in which two counterparties exchange interest payments based upon rates applied to a notional amount 
pulp price derivatives include fixed price pulp swaps which are contracts in which two counterparties exchange payments based upon the difference between the market price of pulp and the notional amount in the contract 
energy derivatives include fixed electricity forward sales and purchase contracts which are contractual obligations to buy or sell electricity at a future specified date 
our mills produce surplus electricity that we sell to third parties 
as a result  we monitor the electricity market closely 
where possible and to the extent we think it is advantageous  we may sell into the forward market through forward contracts 

table of contents we occasionally use foreign exchange derivatives to convert some of our costs including currency swaps relating to our long term indebtedness from euros to us dollars as our principal product is priced in us dollars 
we have also converted some of our costs to us dollars by issuing long term us dollar denominated debt in the form of our senior notes 
we use interest rate derivatives to fix the rate of interest on indebtedness  including under the stendal loan facility 
the interest rate derivatives we entered into were pursuant to the stendal loan facility which provides facilities for foreign exchange derivatives  interest rate derivatives and commodities derivatives  subject to prescribed controls  including maximum notional and at risk amounts 
the stendal loan facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the stendal mill and has the benefit of certain german governmental guarantees 
this credit facility does not have a separate margin requirement when derivatives are entered into and is subsequently marked to market each period 
the rosenthal loan facility also allows us to enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to its operations but  as at december   we had not entered into any such derivative instruments 
we record unrealized gains and losses on our outstanding derivatives when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled 
we determine market valuations based primarily upon valuations provided by our counterparties 
in august  stendal entered into the stendal interest rate swap contract in connection with its long term indebtedness relating to the stendal mill to fix the interest rate under the stendal loan facility at the then low level  relative to its historical trend and projected variable interest rate 
these contracts were entered into under a specific credit line under the stendal loan facility and are subject to prescribed controls  including certain maximum amounts for notional and at risk amounts 
under the stendal interest rate swap contract  stendal pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate with the interest payments being calculated on a notional amount 
the interest rates payable under the stendal loan facility were swapped into fixed rates based on the eur euribor rate for the repayment periods of the tranches under the stendal loan facility 
stendal effectively converted the stendal loan facility from a variable interest rate loan into a fixed interest rate loan  thereby reducing interest rate uncertainty 
in may  we entered into a fixed price pulp swap contract with a bank 
under the contract   mts of pulp per month is fixed at a price of per mt for each month between may and december of the contract expired in december in november  we entered into two additional contracts 
under the terms of these contracts   mts of pulp per month is fixed at prices which range from to per mt 
these contracts expire in december we are exposed to very modest credit related risks in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivative contracts 
however  we do not expect that the counterparties  which are major financial institutions and large utilities  will fail to meet their obligations

the remaining contract commenced in april for a notional amount of million  with an interest rate of  and the notional amount gradually decreases and the contract terminates upon the maturity of the stendal loan facility in october in may  we entered into a fixed price pulp swap contract with a bank 
under the contract   mts of pulp per month is fixed at a price of per mt for each month between may and december of in november  we entered into two additional contracts under the terms of which  mts of pulp per month are fixed at prices which range from to per mt 
these contracts expire in december interest rate risk fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments which are sensitive to such fluctuations 
a decrease in interest rates may increase the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument assets and an increase in interest rates may decrease the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument liabilities  thereby increasing our fair value 
an increase in interest rates may decrease the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument assets and a decrease in interest rates may increase the fair value of such fixed interest rate financial instrument liabilities  thereby decreasing our fair value 
we seek to manage our interest rate risks through the use of interest rate derivatives
