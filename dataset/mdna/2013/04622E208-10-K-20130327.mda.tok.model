item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company develops  markets and supports service management software solutions  which are licensed to companies that sell and service equipment  or sell and deliver professional services 
the company s principal product offerings  astea alliance and fieldcentrix enterprise suites  integrate and automate sales and service business processes and are designed to assist its users to increase competitive advantages  top line revenue growth and profitability through better management of information  people  assets and cash flows 
we believe that astea alliance offers substantially broader and far superior capabilities over the company s predecessor product  dispatch  which was designed for only field service and customer support management applications 
the company s products and services are primarily used in industries such as information technology  medical devices and diagnostic systems  industrial controls and instrumentation  retail systems  office automation  imaging systems  facilities management and telecommunications 
an eclectic group of other industries  all with equipment sales and service requirements  are also represented in astea s customer base 
the company maintains offices in the united states  united kingdom  australia  israel  japan and the netherlands 
the company generates revenues from two sources software license fees for its software products  and services and maintenance revenues from professional services  which includes consulting  implementation  training and maintenance related to those products 
software license fees accounted for of the company s total revenues in  which was divided between sales of astea alliance at and fieldcentrix at 
software license fee revenues also include some fees from the sublicensing of third party software  primarily knowledge management  mapping and analytical software licenses 
typically  customers pay a license fee for the software based on the number of licensed users 
depending on the contract terms and conditions  software license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
if significant vendor obligations exist at the time of delivery or if the product is subject to uncertain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until no significant obligations remain and or acceptance has occurred 
the remaining component of the company s revenues consists principally of fees derived from professional services associated with the implementation and deployment of the company s software products  and maintenance fees for ongoing customer support  primarily external customer technical support services and product enhancements 
professional services including training are generally charged on an hourly or daily basis and billed on a regular basis pursuant to customer work orders 
training services may also be charged on a per attendee basis with a minimum daily charge 
out of pocket expenses incurred by company personnel performing professional services are typically reimbursed by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are performed unless the services are under a fixed price arrangement 
consulting  training and other services that are sold under fixed price arrangements are recognized using the proportional performance method based on direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated direct labor hours required to complete the project 
consulting services primarily comprise implementation support related to the installation and configuration of the company products and do not typically require significant production  modification or customization of the software 
in arrangements that require significant production  modification or customization of the software and where services are not available from third party suppliers  the consulting and license fees are recognized concurrently 
when total cost estimates exceed revenue in a fixed price arrangement  the estimated losses are recognized immediately in cost of revenue 
maintenance fees are typically paid to the company under written agreements entered into at the time of the initial software license 
maintenance revenue  which is generally invoiced annually  is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its summary of significant accounting policies  note  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below  however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition astea s revenue is principally recognized from two sources i licensing arrangements and ii services and maintenance 
the company markets its products primarily through its direct sales force and resellers 
license agreements do not provide for a right of return  and historically  product returns have not been significant 
the company recognizes revenue from license sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
we utilize written contracts as a means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products support and services are sold to our customers 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs after a license key has been delivered electronically to the customer 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms in excess of one year is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
if collectability is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
our typical end user license agreements do not contain acceptance clauses 
however  if acceptance criteria are required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance has occurred 
if these criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
there may be cases  however  in which there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item s but no such evidence for the delivered item s 
in those cases  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item s equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered item s 
we apply the revenue recognition policies discussed below to each separate unit of accounting 
astea allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the elements respective fair value  determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
specifically  astea determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the price  at the date of sale  if sold separately  which is generally a fixed percentage of the software license selling price 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which the company charges for those services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
if an undelivered element for which evidence of fair value does not exist  all revenue in an arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered or fair value can be determined 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of the revenue recognized upon delivery can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of undelivered elements 
the residual value  after allocation of the fee to the undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  is then allocated to the perpetual software license for the software products being sold 
when appropriate  the company may allocate a portion of its software revenue to post contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non standard rates when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement 
amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products which  in the company s opinion  approximate fair value 
software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the company s standard prices 
the company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer 
the company regularly communicates with its resellers and recognizes revenue based on information from its resellers regarding possible returns and collectability 
however  the company does not have a history of returns from the resellers 
revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally twelve months on a straight line basis 
consulting and training service revenue is generally unbundled and recognized at the time the service is performed 
if the company does have any fixed price arrangements for services the revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method based on direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated direct labor hours required to complete the project 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that the contract has been executed  delivery of the software has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
we believe that our accounting estimates used in applying our revenue recognition are critical because the determination that it is probable that the customer will pay for the products and services purchased is inherently judgmental  the allocation of proceeds to certain elements in multiple element arrangements is complex  the determination of whether a service is essential to the functionality of the software is complex  establishing company specific fair values of elements in multiple element arrangements requires adjustments from time to time to reflect recent prices charged when each element is sold separately  and the determination of the stage of completion for certain consulting arrangements is complex 
changes in the aforementioned items could have a material effect on the type and timing of revenue recognized 
if we were to change our pricing approach in the future  this could affect our revenue recognition estimates  in particular  if bundled pricing precludes establishment of vsoe 
we present taxes assessed by a governmental authority including sales  use  value added and excise taxes on a net basis and  therefore  the presentation of these taxes is excluded from our revenues and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until such amounts are remitted to the taxing authority 
cost of software license fees cost of software license fees includes amortization of the capitalized software development costs and third party licenses sold to customers 
cost of services and maintenance cost of services and maintenance includes compensation and benefits provided to our professional service employees  independent consultants  telecommunication cost  unreimbursed travel expenses and allocated facility costs 
product development product development costs include our research and development expenses which consist primarily of personnel and related costs  including salaries and employee benefits for software engineers 
to date  our product development efforts have been devoted to new products and service offerings and increases in features and functionality of our existing products and services 
sales and marketing sales and marketing costs include compensation  commissions and benefits paid to our sales and marketing teams  telecommunication costs  marketing and sales costs  professional fees and facility costs 
general and administrative costs general and administrative costs include salaries  benefits and related costs for the company s finance  administrative and executive management personnel  external accounting and audit costs  bad debt expense  professional fees  corporate facility costs and other costs associated with being a public company 
depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to ten years for computers and related equipment  furniture and fixtures  software and office equipment  and the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from five to ten years 
deferred revenue deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from post contract support  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered or license revenue which has been deferred until all revenue recognition requirements have been met or services are performed 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its customer accounts that are significantly past due  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the company 
actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on the company s revenue recognition policy  but due to contractual restraints over timing of invoicing  the company does not have the right to invoice the customer 
we believe that our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts is critical because of the significance of our accounts receivable balance relative to total assets 
if the general economy deteriorated  or factors affecting the profitability or liquidity of the industry changed significantly  then this could affect the accuracy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
capitalized software and research and development costs the company capitalizes software development costs incurred during the period subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the product s availability for general release 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to product development expense 
product development expense includes payroll  employee benefits  other headcount related costs associated with product development and any related costs to third parties under sub contracting or net of any collaborative arrangements 
software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis over the greater of the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products beginning with the initial release to customers 
the company s estimated life for its capitalized software products is two years based on current sales trends and the rate of product release 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of the capitalized software development costs should be revised or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on the estimated future revenues of each product 
as of december   management believes that no revisions to the remaining useful lives or write downs of capitalized software development costs are required 
we believe that our estimate of our capitalized software costs and the period for their amortization is critical because of the significance of our balance of capitalized software costs relative to our total assets 
potential impairment is determined by comparing the balance of unamortized capitalized software costs to the sales revenue projected for a capitalized software product 
if efforts to sell that software product are terminated  or if the projected sales revenue from that software product drops below a level that is less than the unamortized balance  then an impairment would be recognized 
goodwill part of the purchase price for the fieldcentrix assets  acquired september   included the acquisition of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october it is also tested between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist  as for example when the company s market capitalization significantly declines for a sustained period  using a fair value based approach 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the company elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of its fourth quarter of on a prospective basis for goodwill impairment tests 
in accordance with the guidance  the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if the company believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary 
if necessary  the company applies a two step method for determining goodwill impairment  the market and income approaches 
the market approach analyzes the market valuations of similar companies in our peer group based on recent market conditions 
the income approach analyzes the company s expectation for future results based on current and expected economic conditions 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of revenue  operating income  depreciation and amortization  cash flows and capital expenditures 
acquired intangible asset acquired intangible asset with a finite life excluding goodwill is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that the asset may be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
no impairment of acquired intangible asset has been identified during any of the periods presented 
stock based compensation option plans the company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing formula and amortizes the estimated option value using an accelerated amortization method where each option grant is split into tranches based on vesting periods 
the company s expected term represents the period that the company s share based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on historical experience regarding similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share based awards and employee termination data 
executive level employees who hold a majority of options outstanding  and non executive level employees each have similar historical option exercise and termination behavior and thus were grouped for valuation purposes 
the company s expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of its traded common stock and places exclusive reliance on historical volatilities to estimate our stock volatility over the expected term of its awards 
the company has historically not paid dividends to common stockholders and has no foreseeable plans to issue dividends 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield from the us treasury zero coupon bonds with an equivalent term 
under the company s stock option plans  options awards generally vest over a four year period of continuous service and have a year contractual term 
the fair value of each option is amortized on a straight line basis over the option s vesting period 
the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes merton option pricing formula 
there were  and  options granted during the year ended december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence which includes  among other things  our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have a stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  against which we provided a valuation allowance 
our net deferred tax assets were generated primarily by operating losses 
accordingly  it is more likely than not  that we will not realize these assets through future operations 
the company prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
estimated interest is recorded as a component of interest expense and penalties are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses 
in  the israel taxing authority ita notified the company that it intended to re examine a transaction that it had previously approved 
during the course of the examination  the ita also reviewed the years through in january  a comprehensive settlement covering the tax years through was completed for a total settlement of  convertible preferred stock on september  the company issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock series a preferred stock to its chief executive officer at a price of per share for a total of  dividends accrue daily on the series a preferred at a rate of and are payable only when  as and if declared by the company s board of directors  quarterly in arrears 
the company paid  in preferred stock dividends for the years ending december  and the series a preferred stock may be converted into common stock at the rate of one share of common for each share of series a preferred stock 
commencing two years after issuance  the company has certain rights to cause conversion of all of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding 
commencing four years after issuance  the company may redeem  subject to board approval  all of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding at a price equal to the greater of i of the purchase price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends and ii the fair market value of such number of shares of common stock which the holder of the series a preferred stock would be entitled to receive had the redeemed series a preferred stock been converted immediately prior to the redemption 
the company recorded the series a preferred stock on the company s consolidated balance sheet within stockholders equity 
recently adopted accounting guidance in june  the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
instead  an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate consecutive statements 
the new guidance also requires entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
in december  the fasb issued guidance which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
we adopted the new guidance beginning january   using two consecutive statements for all periods presented 
adoption of this new guidance only resulted in financial statement presentation changes 
on january   we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
the guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis  and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts 
additionally  the guidance expands the disclosures on level inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions  as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs 
adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  selected financial data and the percentages of the company s total revenues by each line item for the periods presented years ended december  revenues software license fees services and maintenance total revenues cost of revenues cost of software license fees cost of services and maintenance total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses product development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses interest income provision for income tax net loss income comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  software license revenues decreased in  compared to services and maintenance fees for amounted to  a increase from software license fee revenues decreased  or to  in from  in astea alliance license revenues decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of 
the decrease resulted from a decrease in astea license sales in europe and japan  partially offset by an increase in license sales in the us 
the company sold  of fieldcentrix licenses in compared to  in  a decrease of 
the decrease was the result of having one new customer in compared to a greater distribution of sales to new and existing customers in total services and maintenance revenues increased  or to  in from  in service and maintenance revenue increased  or on the astea alliance products 
the increase primarily resulted from increased projects from new customers in the us  as well as increased maintenance revenue from new license sales 
in addition  there were a number of ongoing projects as well as upgrades of existing customers from older versions of the company s software to its latest version 
fieldcentrix service and maintenance revenue increased  or 
the increase is due to existing customers upgrading to the latest version of fieldcentrix compared to the same period in for the year ended december  there were no customers that represented or more of total revenues and for the year ended december  there was one customers that represented or more of total revenues 
costs of revenues costs of software license fees decreased to  in from  in included in the cost of software license fees is the fixed cost of capitalized software amortization 
the principal cause of the decrease results from a decrease in the amortization of capitalized software costs and a decrease in third party costs resulting from a decrease in license sales in amortization of capitalized software decreased to  in from  in this decrease resulted from the end of amortization of certain versions of previous capitalized software development costs 
the gross margin percentage on software license sales was in and in the decline in license gross margin resulted primarily from the decrease in license sales in costs of services and maintenance increased to  in from  in the increase in cost of service and maintenance is attributed primarily to an increase in headcount from last year to this year and salary increase in offset by a decrease in outside consultants used in the us and european locations 
the service and maintenance gross margin percentage was in both and gross profit gross profit decreased to  in from  in as a percentage of revenue  gross profit was for the year ended december  and for year ended december  the year over year decrease in gross profit was largely driven by a decrease in software license revenues that generally have a higher gross profit than service and maintenance revenue 
operating expenses product development product development expense decreased  or  to  in from  in the decrease resulted from an increase in capitalized product development costs of  in compared to and a reduction in product development personnel 
fluctuations in product development expense from period to period can vary due to the amount of product development expense which is capitalized 
software development costs of  were capitalized in compared to  during the same period in in  the company added significant functionality to astea alliance products in development 
gross development expense was  in  an decrease over  spent in the decrease was due to a reduction in headcount 
product development as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in compared to in the decrease in product development costs relative to revenues is due to the increase in capitalized software costs in and lower headcount 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in sales and marketing expense is attributable to an increase in sales force headcount in the us and europe and increases in recruiting fees for the additional headcount 
marketing costs have remained consistent from to the company continues to focus on expanding its market presence through intensified marketing efforts to increase awareness of the company s products including the new service vision that was released in this occurs through the use of webinars focused in the vertical industries in which the company operates  attendance at selected trade shows  and increased efforts in lead generation for its sales force 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly to in compared to in general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of salaries  benefits and related costs for the company s finance  administrative and executive management personnel  legal costs  accounting costs  bad debt expense and various costs associated with the company s status as a public company 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to the increase in salary and benefits expense  operating expenses in our japanese subsidiary  an increase in bad debt expense  an increase in other taxes as well as an increase in outside recruiting fees 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses amounted to in compared to in interest income interest income decreased or  to  in from  in the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the level of investments throughout compared to income tax benefit expense the company recorded a tax benefit of  in and a provision of  in for income taxes 
the tax benefit was due to a reduction from a prior year tax provision from our european operations that was deemed to no longer be necessary 
the tax provision was primarily the result of the tax settlement in israel  as well as  income tax due for income earned in israel because of the company no longer having a tax holiday in israel 
international operations total revenues from the company s international operations decreased by  or to  in from  in the decrease resulted from reduced license sales in the asia pacific region  as well decreases in professional services in europe due to declining demand 
overall  international operations generated a net loss of  for compared to net loss of  in net loss income the company generated a net loss of  for the year ended december  compared to net income of  in the reduction in net income of  is primarily the result of a decrease in revenues and a increase in operating expenses 
the principal cause for the increase in operating expenses was due to increases in both headcount in all regions and travel costs 
in addition  the mix of revenues changed 
license revenues which generate higher profit margins declined while professional services revenues which generate lower profit margins  increased by 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  compared to the year ended december  in which  of cash was generated by operations 
the decrease was attributable to a decrease in net income of  a decrease in accounts payable of  and a decrease in deferred revenue of  offsetting the decreases in cash flow were an increase in cash of  related to collections from accounts receivable  an increase in cash from prepaid expenses of  and an increase in cash from other assets of  in addition  there was a decrease of  related to non cash activities 
investing activities the company used  less for investment activities in compared to the decrease in cash used for investing activities is attributable to a reduction of  short term investments in compared to  a decrease in sales of short term investment of  a decrease of  in capitalized software development costs  and an increase of  in restricted cash offset by a decrease of  in the purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities the company used  less for financing activities in compared to the only financing expenditures in and were payments of  of preferred stock dividends in each year 
financing inflows in and occurred from the exercise of stock options which provided  and  respectively 
due to the weakening of the us dollar related to most other currencies in which the company operates  primarily the australian dollar  japanese yen  the euro  the british pound sterling and the israel shekel  the effect of exchange rates on cash provided an inflow of  in  an increase in cash flow of  compared to at december   the company had a working capital ratio of approximately 
compared to 
at december  the company had  in cash and investments available for sale at december   compared to  at december  the company has projected revenues for that will generate enough funds to sustain its continuing operations 
in addition  the company has continued with a number of cost containment programs which are expected to contain the cost of operating the business 
the company expects its cash from operations to fund all of its financing needs for the upcoming year 
however  if actual results trail expectations  the company has plans in place to reduce operating expenditures appropriately in order to continue to fund all required expenditures 
the board of directors from time to time reviews the company s forecasted operations and financial condition to determine whether and when payment of a dividend or dividends is appropriate 
the company does not plan any significant capital expenditures in other than to replace its existing capital equipment as it becomes obsolete 
in addition  it does not anticipate that its operations or financial condition will be affected materially by inflation 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual and commercial obligations  as of december  payment due by period total and after contractual cash obligations operating leases dividends may be paid on common stock  when and if  declared by the board of directors 
however  no dividend has been paid on common stock since january dividends on convertible preferred stock are payable at a rate of on a quarterly basis  as declared by the board of directors 
off balance sheet transactions there are no off balance sheet transactions that would require disclosure in the above contractual obligations and commercial commitments table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio 
the company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
the company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as a result  as of december   the company s investments consisted of mutual funds 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk all costs associated with the company s foreign operations in europe  asia pacific  japan and israel are denominated in their respective local currencies and translated into us dollars for financial reporting 
as a result  the company is exposed to risks to the extent that the rate of inflation in any of its foreign operating regions differs from the rate of revaluation of their related currencies in relation to the us dollar or if the timing of such revaluations lags behind inflation in these regions 
in such an event  the costs of the company s operations in these regions  measured in us dollars  will change and the us dollar measured results of operations will be affected 
the company does not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or purchased currency options to hedge local currency cash flows or for trading purposes 
all sales arrangements with international customers are denominated in foreign currency 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to foreign currency risk
