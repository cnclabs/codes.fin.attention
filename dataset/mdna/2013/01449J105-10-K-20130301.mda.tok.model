table of contents overview we enable individuals to take greater control of their health at home  under the supervision of their healthcare providers  by combining near patient diagnostics  health monitoring capabilities and information technology solutions 
a leading global provider of point of care diagnostics and services  we have developed a strong commercial presence in cardiology  infectious disease  toxicology  and diabetes 
our products and services help healthcare practitioners make earlier  more effective treatment decisions and improve outcomes for individuals living with chronic disease 
during  we focused on completing the foundation for this business model  a process which we began during with our acquisitions of avee laboratories in october  escreen in april and branan medical in december  our toxicology group is now a full service provider to a broad range of domestic and foreign employers from industries that require rigorous drug testing 
we also built a strong presence in diabetes from the ground up 
following our november acquisitions of axis shield and arriva medical  which effectively established our diabetes business  we acquired several mail order  diabetes home testing product supply businesses 
our diabetes revenues have grown to over million in  and including the effect of acquisitions completed in early  we now service more than  active diabetes customers 
we believe that the strong foundation that we have built in diabetes  specifically in our mail order diabetes testing supply business  provides us with a competitive advantage in dealing with the impact that cms competitive bidding program  which will significantly reduce current reimbursement rates starting in july  will have on competition and pricing in the market for diabetes testing supplies 
core to our strategy are health information technologies that enable diagnostic data to be fed directly into an information exchange that integrates the diagnostic data with other patient related information in a single health record 
in the second half of and in  we focused on acquiring health information technologies that would supplement our internally developed information technologies  including apollo  and improve our ability to execute our business strategy 
specifically during the second half of  we acquired rals  the point of care industry s leading data management solution  and aegispoc  the first web based data management solution designed for critical care settings  which we have since enhanced and renamed rals freedom 
our rals systems provide bidirectional interfaces that connect a hospital s glucose meters and other point of care devices measuring blood gases  prothrombin time  and cardiac parameters to its laboratory and health information systems 
in december  we acquired wellogic  now alere accountable care solutions  or alere acs 
through alere acs  we deliver health information solutions that help provider organizations meet cms meaningful use requirements and improve coordination across multiple venues of care 
these solutions include the alere health information exchange  which harmonizes multiple streams of data from disparate sources in a single patient centered record  and consult ehr  which gives healthcare practitioners greater visibility into a patient s health status 
in july  we acquired medapps  now alere connect 
alere connect develops and sells remote health monitoring solutions designed to collect health readings from compatible medical monitors and transmit them to a user s electronic health record  as well as web based applications to help practitioners manage this data 
alere connect s comprehensive health information platform and suite of cloud based software tools enhance care for patients in both wellness and chronic disease management programs 
in july  we also acquired diagnosisone  now alere analytics 
through alere analytics  we offer a broad array of analytical and clinical decision support tools  which are delivered on our smartpath platform 
as a result  we now offer a variety of software based analytics  clinical decision support tools  and health improvement programs that enable healthcare providers to initiate earlier interventions  personalize treatment plans  lower costs by reducing hospital readmissions  and measure improvements in outcomes at both a patient and population level 

table of contents during  we also continued to build momentum behind our next generation of novel diagnostic platforms that we expect to drive our growth in future years 
our cd platform continues to gain traction and has expanded our global footprint as a leading provider of chronic hiv management diagnostics 
we are currently developing expansions to this rapid molecular platform to address additional areas such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis 
our second near patient molecular platform  which is focused on a broad spectrum of infectious disease targets  continues to progress through us clinical trials 
we anticipate that the first use of this cartridge based system will be rapid flu testing  but applications for additional targets such as group a streptococcus  respiratory syncytial virus  or rsv  and c 
difficile are planned 
with our novel molecular diagnostic platforms launched  or in the late stages of development  we have now begun to refocus our research and development efforts away from long term projects towards product enhancements and menu expansion for our existing platforms

we conducted our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of when conducting step of the impairment analysis  as prescribed by asc  intangibles goodwill and other  or asc  the analysis indicated that the carrying value of the net assets of our health information solutions reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
as a result  we were required to complete step of the impairment analysis  as prescribed by asc  to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment charge 
the step portion of the analysis indicated that we needed to record a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million  which was recorded during the fourth quarter of any further 
table of contents reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in additional charges against earnings  which could materially reduce our reported results of operations in future periods 
further details of the goodwill impairment analysis are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
interest expense 
interest expense includes interest charges  and the amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts associated with certain debt issuances 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in  from million in this increase was partially due to interest expense of million recorded in  in connection with the termination of our former secured credit facility and related interest rate swap agreement  coupled with the amortization of fees paid for certain debt modifications 
contributing to the increase in interest expense recorded in  compared to  was interest expense incurred on our senior subordinated notes issued in september  totaling approximately million in  compared to million in additionally  higher outstanding debt balances during  compared to  contributed to the increase in interest expense during the respective periods

gain on sale of joint venture interest 
in connection with the formation of spd in may  we entered into an option agreement with p g  pursuant to which p g had the right  for a period of days commencing on may   to require us to acquire all of p g s interest in spd at fair market value 
no gain on the proceeds that we received from p g through the formation of spd was recognized in our financial statements until p g s option to require us to purchase its interest in spd expired

table of contents benefit for income taxes 
benefit for income taxes decreased by million  to a million benefit in  from a million benefit in the effective tax rate in was  compared to in the decrease in the benefit for income taxes from to is primarily related to the tax provision associated with the taxes on foreign income 
the increase in the effective tax rate between the two years primarily results from the rate differential on foreign earnings and state income taxes

liquidity and capital resources based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans and expected business conditions  we expect to fund our short and long term working capital needs primarily using existing cash and our operating cash flow  and we expect our working capital position to improve as we improve our future operating margins and grow our business through new product and service offerings and by continuing to leverage our strong intellectual property position 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  of which million was held by domestic subsidiaries and million was held by foreign entities 
we do not plan to repatriate cash held by foreign entities due to adverse tax implications  including incremental us tax liabilities and potential foreign withholding tax liabilities 
we may also utilize our secured credit facility or other new sources of financing to fund a portion of our capital needs and other commitments  including our contractual contingent consideration 
table of contents obligations and future acquisitions 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings totaling million under the million revolving line of credit under our secured credit facility  leaving million available to us for additional borrowings 
our ability to access the capital markets may be impacted by the amount of our outstanding debt and equity and the extent to which our assets are encumbered by our outstanding secured debt 
the terms and conditions of our outstanding debt instruments also contain covenants which expressly restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and conduct other financings 
as of december   we had billion in outstanding indebtedness comprised of billion under our secured credit facility  million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due and million of convertible senior subordinated notes due in february  we redeemed all of the outstanding senior notes 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further information about our outstanding debt balances 
if the capital and credit markets experience volatility or the availability of funds is limited  we may incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments 
in addition  it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets could be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like  or need  to do so  which could have an adverse impact on our ability to refinance maturing debt and or react to changing economic and business conditions 
our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted by unexpected costs associated with integrating the operations of newly acquired companies  executing our cost savings strategies and prosecuting and defending our existing lawsuits and or unforeseen lawsuits against us 
we also cannot be certain that our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will be realized 
in addition  we intend to continue to make investments in our research and development efforts related to the substantial intellectual property portfolio we own 
we may also choose to further expand our research and development efforts and may pursue the acquisition of new products and technologies through licensing arrangements  business acquisitions  or otherwise 
we may also choose to make significant investment to pursue legal remedies against potential infringers of our intellectual property rights 
if we decide to engage in such activities  or if our operating results fail to meet our expectations  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may be available only on terms which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible securities  dilution to then existing stockholders may result

these loss carryforwards and tax credits may be available to reduce future federal  state and foreign taxable income  if any  and are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate tax authorities 
effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard for business combinations 
prior to adoption of this standard  the pre acquisition losses were applied first to reduce to zero any goodwill and other non current intangible assets related to the acquisitions  prior to reducing our income tax expense 
upon adoption of the new accounting standard  the reduction of a valuation allowance is generally recorded to reduce our income tax expense 
furthermore  all domestic losses and credits are subject to the internal revenue service code section  and limitation  respectively  and may be limited in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership interests of significant shareholders over a three year period in excess of 
section and imposes an annual limitation on the use of these losses or credits to an amount equal to the value of the company at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets related to our nols and credits and certain of our other deferred tax assets to reflect uncertainties that might affect the realization of such deferred tax assets  as these assets can only be realized via profitable operations

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by our management and our audit committee to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application depends on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
in addition  the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  include a comprehensive summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we primarily recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue is derived from product sales 
we recognize revenue upon title transfer of the products to third party customers  less a reserve for estimated product returns and allowances 
determination of the reserve for estimated product returns and allowances is based on our management s analyses and judgments regarding certain conditions 
should future changes in conditions prove management s conclusions and judgments on previous analyses to be incorrect  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
certain of our products require specialized installation 
revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period  or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements  and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element  in accordance with authoritative guidance on multiple element arrangements 
additionally  we generate services revenue in connection with contracts with health plans both commercial and governmental and self insured employers  whereby we provide clinical expertise through fee based arrangements 
revenue for fee based arrangements is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 
some contracts provide that a portion of our fees are at risk if our customers do not achieve certain financial cost savings or we do not achieve certain other clinical and operational metrics  over a period of time  typically one year 
revenue subject to refund is not recognized if i sufficient information is not available to calculate performance measurements or ii interim performance measurements indicate that we are not meeting performance targets 
if either of these two conditions exists  we record the amounts as other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  deferring recognition of the revenue until we establish that we are meeting the performance criteria 
if we do not meet the performance targets at the end of the contractual period we are obligated under the contract to refund some or all of the at risk fees 
we also receive license and royalty revenue from agreements with third party licensees 
revenue from fixed fee license and royalty agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the obligation period of the related license agreements 
license and royalty fees that the licensees calculate based on their sales  which we have the right to audit under most of our agreements  are generally recognized upon receipt of the license or royalty payments  unless we are able to reasonably estimate the fees as they are earned 
license and royalty fees that are determinable prior to the receipt thereof are recognized in the period they are earned 
use of estimates for sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts certain sales arrangements require us to accept product returns 
from time to time  we also enter into sales incentive arrangements with our retail customers  which generally reduce the sale prices of our products 
as a result  we must establish allowances for potential future product returns and claims resulting from our sales incentive arrangements against product revenue recognized in any reporting period 
calculation of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances  our management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer and consumer demand and acceptance of our 
table of contents products 
when such analysis is not available and a right of return exists  we record revenue when the right of return is no longer applicable 
material differences in the amount and timing of our product revenue for any reporting period may result if changes in conditions arise that would require management to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
our total provision for sales returns and other allowances related to sales incentive arrangements amounted to million  million and million  or  and  respectively  of net product sales in  and  respectively  which have been recorded against product sales to derive our net product sales 
of these amounts  approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  represent allowances for future deductions which have been provided against our related accruals for such charges with the balance charged directly against net sales 
similarly  our management must make estimates regarding uncollectible accounts receivable balances 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management analyzes specific accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms and patterns 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
inventory we state our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the estimated current market value of the inventory  less cost to sell 
in addition  we periodically review the inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
this provision reduces the carrying value of our inventory and is calculated based primarily upon factors such as forecasts of our customers demands  shelf lives of our products in inventory  loss of customers and manufacturing lead times 
evaluating these factors  particularly forecasting our customers demands  requires management to make assumptions and estimates 
actual product and services revenue may prove our forecasts to be inaccurate  in which case we may have underestimated or overestimated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if  in future periods  our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize the excess value as a charge to our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if  in future periods  our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we would have over reported our cost of sales  or understated our earnings  at the time we recorded the excess and obsolete provision 
our inventory balance was million and million  net of a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   the balances of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization  were million  billion and billion  respectively 
goodwill relates to amounts that arose in connection with our various business combinations and represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to periodic review for impairment 
we test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests  if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  
table of contents current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment test  we utilize the two step approach 
the first step  or step  requires a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units for step  we use a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  or dcf  and calculates the fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after tax cash flows to a present value  using a risk adjusted discount rate 
assumptions used in the dcf require the exercise of significant judgment  including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values  growth rates and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the forecasted cash flows are based on our most recent budget and for years beyond the budget  our estimates are based on assumed growth rates 
we believe our assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 
the discount rates  which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections  used in the dcf are based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  of market participants relative to each respective reporting unit 
the market approach considers comparable market data based on multiples of revenue or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we are required to perform the second step  or step  of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value of its assets and liabilities 
to the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
we based our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  including estimates of future growth rates and operating margins and assumptions about the overall economic climate and the competitive environment for our business units 
there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill and identifiable intangible asset testing as of the time of testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding business plans  competitive environments or anticipated growth rates are not correct  we may be required to record goodwill and or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing or earlier  if an indicator of an impairment is present before our next annual evaluation 
impairment charges related to goodwill have no impact on our cash balances or compliance with financial covenants under our amended and restated credit agreement 
annual goodwill impairment test we conducted our annual impairment test for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of key assumptions which vary by reporting unit used in determining fair value under the discounted cash flow approach included discount rates ranging from to  projected compound average revenue growth rates of to and terminal value growth rates of to 
in determining the appropriate discount rate  we considered the wacc for each reporting unit  which among other factors considers the cost of common equity capital and the marginal cost of debt of market participants 
key assumptions which again vary by reporting unit used in determining fair value under the market approach were based on observed market multiples of enterprise value to revenue and ebitda for both comparable publicly traded companies and recent merger and acquisition transactions involving similar companies to estimate appropriate controlling basis multiples 
table of contents to apply to each of the reporting units 
based on the multiples implied by this market data  we selected multiples of revenue of to times and multiples of ebitda of to times 
in assessing the reasonableness of our estimated fair values of the reporting units  management compared the results of the valuation analyses against our then current market capitalization to imply a control premium 
based on this analysis  the implied control premium was within the range of comparable industry transactions 
the step impairment analysis indicated the estimated fair value of the professional diagnostics  health information solutions and consumer diagnostics reporting units exceeded the carrying value of their reporting unit s net assets by  and  respectively

we completed step  consistent with the procedures described above  and determined that a goodwill impairment charge in the amount of approximately million was required 
the resulting goodwill impairment charge is reflected in operating income loss in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
this impairment was primarily driven by reduced future cash flow expectations from the reporting unit principally as a result of an increasingly competitive business environment for services provided by the reporting unit  including the insourcing of certain services by key customers and a reduction in spending by other customers as a result in part of the continuing difficult economic climate 
also contributing to the impairment charge was the lower valuations ascribed to similar comparable businesses in the public markets

also contributing to the impairment charge was the lower valuations ascribed to similar comparable businesses in the public markets 
valuation of other long lived tangible and intangible assets factors we generally consider important which could trigger an impairment review on the carrying value of other long lived tangible and intangible assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  underutilization of our tangible assets  discontinuance of product lines by ourselves or our customers  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value and goodwill impairment identified during an impairment review 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test for our reporting units during the fourth quarter 
the impairment tests conducted during and indicated there was an impairment of goodwill associated with our health information solutions reporting unit  and thus  a potential impairment of our long lived tangible and intangible assets associated with the same reporting unit 
we conducted an analysis as prescribed under asc property  plant and equipment  utilizing an undiscounted cash flow model 
the analysis conducted during and indicated there was no impairment of the long lived tangible or intangible assets associated with our health information solutions reporting unit 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
our expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected term is based on the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the midpoint of the vesting 
table of contents date and the full contractual term  including data on experience to date 
as stock based compensation expense is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals and lives assigned to long lived and intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within our tax provision 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to the future benefits  if any  from our deferred tax assets related primarily to our foreign businesses and certain us net operating losses  or nols  and tax credits 
this is an increase of million from the valuation allowance of million as of december  the increase is primarily related to domestic state nols and certain foreign nols 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or reduce our current valuation allowance which could materially impact our tax provision 
we established reserves for tax uncertainties that reflect the use of the comprehensive model for the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
we are currently undergoing routine tax examinations by us federal  various state and foreign jurisdictions 
tax authorities periodically challenge certain transactions and deductions we reported on our income tax returns 
we do not expect the outcome of these examinations  either individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
loss contingencies in the section of this annual report on form k entitled part i  item  legal proceedings  we have reported on material legal proceedings  if any 
because of the nature of our business  we may be subject at any particular time to lawsuits or other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  and we expect that this will continue to be the case in the future 
we do not accrue for potential losses on legal proceedings where our company is the defendant when we are not able to reasonably estimate our potential liability  if any  due to uncertainty as to the nature  extent and validity of the claims against us  uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the damages or other relief sought by the plaintiff and the complexity of the issues involved 
our potential liability  if any  in a particular case may become reasonably estimable and probable as the case progresses  in which case we will begin accruing for the expected loss

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and financing activities 
in addition  our ability to finance future acquisition transactions or fund working capital requirements may be impacted if we are not able to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates 
to manage our interest rate exposure  our strategy is to invest in short term  highly liquid investments 
our investment policy also requires investment in approved instruments with an initial maximum allowable maturity of eighteen months and an average maturity of our portfolio that should not exceed six months  with at least  cash available at all times 
at december   our short term investments consisted of money market funds with original maturities of days or less 
at december   our short term investments approximated market value 
at december   under the credit agreement for our secured credit facility we had i term loans in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of billion consisting of a term loans including the delayed draw term loans in the aggregate principal amount of million  b term loans in the aggregate principal amount of million  incremental b term loans in the aggregate principal amount of million and incremental b term loans in the aggregate principal amount of million  ii million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit and iii subject to our continued compliance with the credit agreement  the ability to borrow a maximum of up to an additional million under our revolving line of credit  which includes a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
loans can be either base rate loans or eurodollar rate loans at our election  and interest accrues on loans and our other obligations under the terms of the credit agreement as follows with the terms referenced above and below in this paragraph having the meanings given to them in the credit agreement i in the case of loans that are base rate loans  at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the base rate and the applicable margin  each as in effect from time to time  ii in the case of loans that are eurodollar rate loans  at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the eurodollar rate and the applicable margin  each as in effect for the applicable interest period  and iii in the case of other obligations  at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the base rate and the applicable margin for revolving loans that are base rate loans  each as in effect from time to time 
the base rate is a floating rate which approximates the us prime rate as in effect from time to time 
the eurodollar rate is equal to the libor rate and is set for a period of one  two  three or six months at our election 
applicable margins for our a term loans including the delayed draw term loans and revolving line of credit loans range from i with respect to such loans that are base rate loans  to and ii with respect to such loans that are eurodollar rate loans  to  in each case  depending upon our consolidated secured leverage ratio as determined under the credit agreement 
applicable margins for our b term loans  incremental b term loans and incremental b term loans range from i with respect to such loans that are base rate loans  to and ii with respect to such loans that are eurodollar rate loans  to  in each case  depending upon our consolidated secured leverage ratio 
interest on b term 
table of contents loans  incremental b term loans and incremental b term loans based on the eurodollar rate is subject to a floor with respect to the base eurodollar rate 
assuming no changes in our consolidated secured leverage ratio  the effect of interest rate fluctuations on outstanding borrowings as of december  over the next twelve months is quantified and summarized as follows in thousands interest expense increase interest rates payable by us increase by basis points interest rates payable by us increase by basis points foreign currency risk we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates whenever we  or any of our subsidiaries  enter into transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our  or its  functional currency 
intercompany transactions between entities that use different functional currencies also expose us to foreign currency risk 
during  the net impact of foreign currency changes on transactions was a loss of million 
gross margins of products we manufacture at our foreign plants and sell in us dollars or manufacture in our us plants and sell in currencies other than the us dollar are also affected by foreign currency exchange rate movements 
our gross margin on total net product sales was in if the us dollar had been stronger by  or  compared to the actual rates during  our gross margin on total net product sales would have been  and  respectively 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries  whose functional currencies are other than the us dollar in which we report our consolidated financial results  our earnings could be materially impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates upon the translation of the earnings of such subsidiaries into the us dollar 
if the us dollar had been uniformly stronger by  or  compared to the actual average exchange rates used to translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries  our net product sales and net income would have been impacted by approximately the following amounts in thousands approximate decrease in net revenue approximate decrease in net income if  during  the us dollar was stronger by
