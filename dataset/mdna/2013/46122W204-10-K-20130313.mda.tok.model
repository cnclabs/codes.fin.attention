item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview inuvo is an internet marketing and technology company that develops consumer applications and delivers targeted advertisements onto websites reaching desktop and mobile 
we operate two segments  network and applications 
in  we reorganized operations along these two new operating segments previously referred to as publisher network and software search  respectively 
prior to  our segments were classified as performance marketing and web properties 
the network segment designs  builds  implements  manages and sells the various business to business technology platforms and services that we offer 
the segment also designs  builds and markets to the various web properties we own and operate 
the segment is also responsible for managing the various affiliate technology and programs we manage either directly or indirectly 
the technology that supports this segment facilitates transactions between advertisers and website publishers in an automated and transparent environment 
the majority of the revenue earned within this segment is derived from clicks on advertisements as well as from commissions on the sales of products through the applications  websites and platforms 
we believe that greater transparency and alignment between advertisers and publishers  combined with sophisticated analytic technologies that predict fraud and target offers more effectively  will differentiate service providers in this marketplace 
the applications segment designs  builds and markets the various business to consumer products we offer 
revenue earned within this segment is derived from clicks on advertisements and sponsored advertisements within applications 
on march  we completed the acquisition of vertro  inc vertro  an internet company that owns and operates the alot product portfolio  comprised of both browser based consumer applications and websites 
vertro operations are now part of our applications segment 
in evaluating the merger  we  and the management of vertro  believed that the combination of the two companies could create a stronger  more scalable business  from which to attract advertisers  publishers and consumers 
the merger allowed for greater diversification of revenue streams  mitigating dependence on a single customer  the existing alot install and distribution capability has provided a vehicle for our consumer facing innovations like bargainmatch  the combined business is a greater footprint to access the debt and capital markets  the combining of two experienced digital marketing teams has broadened our ability and reduced time to market  and the elimination of overlapping operating and public company expenses has reduced combined costs by over million per year 
on january   we announced that we had received a grant of million from the state of arkansas to assist with the costs of purchasing equipment and relocating our headquarters to conway  arkansas  as discussed in the next section 
subsequent events on january   we agreed with the state of arkansas to receive a grant of up to million to assist with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to conway  arkansas 
in accepting the grant  we agreed to have at least full time equivalent  permanent positions in arkansas within four years  and maintain that personnel level for another six years at a total average compensation of  per year 
if we fail to meet the requirements of the grant after the initial four year period  we may be required to repay a portion of the grant  up to but not to exceed the full amount of the grant 
in conjunction with the relocation  we will close our clearwater  florida office and plan to sublease our new york city office 
in addition  we will consolidate two data center collocation facilities in new york city into a single collocation facility in arkansas 
a reduced lease space  a single collocation facility  and a generally lower cost of living are expected to have a significant favorable effect on our operating expenses 
on january   we agreed to an early termination of the clearwater office lease 
for a total early termination fee of  the lease will terminate on march  on january  we signed a two year lease for  square feet of office space in conway  ar 
on february  we agreed to a two year services agreement with google inc for advertising and search services 
on march   bridge bank na waived an event of default that occurred in january nyse mkt on may   we received notice from the nyse mkt  llc  formerly nyse amex the exchange that we did not meet certain of the exchange continued listing standards due to stockholders equity of less than million and losses from continuing operations and or net losses in three of the four most recent fiscal years as set forth in section a ii of the nyse mkt company guide 
the exchange accepted our plan to regain compliance with the continued listing standards and on september   we received notification from the exchange that the continued listing deficiencies were resolved 
however  since we had losses from continuing operations and or net losses in five of out most recent fiscal years  the exchange minimum requirement for continued listing becomes a stockholder equity of not less than  at september   our stockholders equity was million and in november  inuvo was notified by the exchange that we were below the exchange continued listing standards 
we were afforded the opportunity to submit a plan of compliance to the exchange by december   that demonstrates our ability to regain compliance with section a iii of the company guide by december  the plan period 
we submitted our plan and were notified on february  that the plan was accepted by the exchange 
we are able to continue our listing during the plan period  though subject to periodic review to determine whether we are making progress consistent with the plan 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting practices gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  goodwill and amortizable intangibles  certain stock based compensation and income taxes  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition general asc 
under asc  we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed and determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the following principles with respect to our different business services search advertising in accordance with asc revenue recognition principal agent considerations asc  we record the gross amount received from advertisers as revenue and the amount paid to the publishers placing the advertisements as cost of sales 
revenue is earned on our owned networks on a per click basis and is recognized when the end user clicks on an advertisement 
affiliate advertising in accordance with asc we recognize revenue as an agent in affiliate marketing transactions in which we are not the primary obligor 
accordingly  service fee revenue is recognized on a net basis because any affiliate expenses are the responsibility of our advertising customer 
in certain instances we assume the position of primary obligor and thus recognize revenue on a gross basis 
revenue is recognized when the related services are performed 
affiliate software we recognize revenue the month in which the software is utilized 
customers are invoiced on the first of the month for the monthly services 
all overages for the month are billed at the end of the month and are included in unbilled revenue 
hosting arrangements we recognize revenue through a monthly hosting fee and additional usage fees as provided 
online membership income we recognize revenue from online membership revenue when payment is received and the service date of providing membership benefits has taken place 
lead sales for lead sales  our revenue recognition varies depending on the arrangement with the purchaser 
where the arrangement provides for delivery only  revenue is recognized when the lead information is provided to the purchaser 
where the arrangement provides for compensation based on sales generated by the purchaser from the lead  we recognize revenue in the period that the purchasing company makes a sale that was derived from the lead we provided 
list management services substantially all of our revenue is recorded at the net amount of its gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a customer 
in most cases  the amount that is billed to customers exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements  because of various pass through expenses 
in compliance with asc  we assess whether we or a third party supplier is the primary obligor 
we have evaluated the terms of our customer agreements and considered other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price  discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor as part of this assessment 
accordingly  we generally record revenue net of pass through charges 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we record our accounts receivable based upon the invoiced amount and they are considered past due when full payment is not received by the specified credit terms 
we estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon those estimates 
the allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying value  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the gross profit approach methodology of valuation that includes the undiscounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets  which result from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed annually for impairment under asc for the year ended december   we had no impairments to our goodwill and other intangible assets  and for the year ended december   we had impairments of our goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million as a result of exiting our call center activities 
deferred taxes we reserve for federal and state income taxes on items included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss regardless of the period when the taxes are payable 
deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis 
in determining our current income tax provision  we assess temporary differences resulting from different treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
in evaluating our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends upon generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax attributes 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we must project future levels of taxable income 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
we examine the evidence related to a recent history of tax losses  the economic conditions in which we operate  recent organizational changes  and our forecasts and projections to make this judgment 
we have adopted certain provisions of asc income taxes 
this statement clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
stock awards and stock based compensation we value stock compensation based on the fair value recognition provisions asc  compensation stock compensation  which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the estimated grant date fair value of option grants over the requisite employee service period 
the merger agreement with vertro required that at closing of the merger  we pay outstanding obligations under our deferred compensation program and bonus agreements to our executive officers  board of directors and certain management employees with our common stock in lieu of cash 
these obligations were satisfied by issuing  shares of our common stock 
at the same time   of the common stock issued to executives  board directors and managers were withheld by us at the same value as issued  to pay for the associated individual income taxes  approximately  those shares withheld were retired 
in the third quarter of  we issued  restricted stock grants to our senior management and board of directors 
we also issued  restricted stock grants to certain other managers 
the grants to the senior management and board of directors were performance based and whose targets were not achieved and were therefore canceled 
the grants to the other managers were fully vested on february  and  shares of restricted stock were distributed 
in december  a restricted stock grant of  shares was granted to our former chief executive officer 
the grant vests fifty percent on each of the next two anniversaries 
during the year ended december   our executive officers  certain of our senior management and our board of directors  voluntarily elected to defer a portion of their compensation 
the amount of the deferred compensation was approximately  as an incentive for officers  management and directors to participate in the elected deferrals  we granted them restricted stock awards rsas with a fair value equal to the amount of the deferred compensation 
the rsas vest upon the earlier of payment of the deferred compensation or one year from the date of grant 
the number of rsas granted in conjunction with the deferred compensation program was  for the year ended december  and were granted at an exercise price ranging from per share to per share on the date of each grant 
with the merger of vertro on march   all the rsas granted vested and subsequently the shares of restricted stock granted in connection with these elected deferrals were issued

results of operations overview of net revenues increased and gross profit increased in compared to the increases were due to our applications segment which is composed largely of the alot products acquired with our merger with vertro 
in  our operating expenses increased by approximately over due primarily to search costs from the applications segment  which increased million 
our net loss from continuing operations for decreased by approximately million or from due to improved gross profit and the cost synergies derived from the merger with vertro 
the financial results for include only ten months of combined financial results of the merger with vertro which took effect on march in  management reorganized operations along two new operating segments  network and applications previously referred to as publisher network and software search  respectively 
prior to  our segments were classified as performance marketing and web properties 
the following tables adjust the financial presentation to reflect the new organization 
net revenue total net revenue from our network and applications segments for and were as follows year ended december  of revenue of revenue change change network applications total net revenue not meaningful net revenue from our network segment decreased over last year primarily due to a decrease in the number of transactions driven through our owned and operated website 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of we experienced traffic irregularities from sources we identified and subsequently eliminated from our platform  contributing to the decline in revenues during as a result  we changed our marketing on the validclick platform to focus on smaller website publishers where we had better visibility to their traffic and could offer them value added services 
net revenue from our applications segment is primarily a result of the merger with vertro on march  net revenue from the applications segment is derived from the alot users conducting searches that produce both algorithmic results and sponsored listings 
both the algorithmic results and sponsored listings are provided by third parties with whom we have contractual relationships 
when users click on a sponsored listing after conducting a search  we earn a percentage of the total click through revenue provided by the third party that placed the advertisement 
this segment also includes the non search revenue generated from the alot products 
the largest portion of non search revenue is derived from display ads presented on the alot homepage 
recently we have seen a decline in click through revenue and display advertising due to implementation changes made by our advertising provider 
a provider of paid search results for our applications segment accounted for approximately of our total net revenues for no revenue from that paid search provider was included in our total net revenue for additionally  the network segment serves hundreds of thousands of individual advertisers within the business 
access to those advertisers comes principally through our relationship with a top three search engine  which accounted for approximately and of total net revenues for and  respectively 
the lower percentage this year is due to the diversification of the revenue streams achieved by merging with vertro in march we believe that the revenue from the network segment will grow as we develop our owned and operated websites as well as continue the focus on smaller publishers in our third party platform  validclick 
our applications segment is historically dependent upon one of the three largest search engines 
this partner changed its search policies in the first quarter of we anticipate these policy changes to have a deleterious effect on the applications segment going forward 
cost of revenue and gross profit cost of revenue  which includes affiliate payments  data acquisition amortization  merchant processing fees and product costs  were as follows year ended december  of revenue of revenue change change affiliate expenses data acquisition merchant processing fees and product costs total cost of revenue the lower affiliate payments in as a percentage of revenue compared to is due to the overall greater revenue in the current year compared to last year and to the fact that of the revenue is from the applications segment which does not have any affiliate payments 
we anticipate that these costs will continue to increase in dollar amounts as revenue from the network segment increases but to decrease as a percentage of revenue as we scale into higher revenue share with partners and expand the number of owned and operated websites which do not have an affiliate payment 
the increase in data acquisition costs for as compared to is due primarily to acquiring bundled downloads to drive revenue through our alot appbar which was acquired in the vertro acquisition in march we do not expect these costs to increase in the future 
the following table provides information on gross profit by operating segment for each of the periods presented year ended december  of gross profit of gross profit change change network applications total gross profit not meaningful gross profit from our network segment decreased for compared to primarily due to lower revenue of owned and operated websites as described above in net revenue 
gross profit from the applications segment increased as a result of the alot operations acquired in the merger with vertro in march operating expenses operating expenses  which consist of search costs  compensation and telemarketing and selling  general and administrative expenses were as follows year ended december  of revenue of revenue change change search costs compensation and telemarketing selling  general and administrative total operating expenses search costs increased for compared to primarily due to the advertising spend to create download traffic for the alot appbar 
this expense is not expected to increase in the future as we focus on stabilizing the alot user base and revenue 
compensation and telemarketing expense decreased for compared to primarily due to the discontinuance of the telemarketing operations in june telemarketing expense was million in this was partially offset by the recording in of a severance charge of  associated with our former ceo 
at december   we had a headcount of employees compared to employees at december  selling  general and administrative expense increased approximately for compared to primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense  higher facilities expense  and the indirect costs associated with the merger with vertro in march we expect that as a result of our decision to relocate to conway  arkansas  close our clearwater  florida office  the anticipated sublease of our office space in new york city and consolidate two data center collocation facilities in new york city into a single collocation facility in arkansas  combined with a generally lower cost of living in arkansas  we will significantly lower operating expenses in the future 
other income expense other income expense includes net interest expense  impairment charges to goodwill and intangible assets  loss on sale of assets  and litigation settlements 
net interest expense  which is related to our borrowings from bridge bank  na  increased by approximately  or in as compared to this increase in interest expense reflects higher overall borrowing balances and includes a  warrant to bridge bank associated with the execution of the second business financing modification agreement 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value 
in  we had an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million associated with our babytobee business as a result of exiting our call center activities 
additionally during we wrote off approximately  of software development costs associated with kidzadu as we have decided to discontinue the launch of this marketing campaign 
during  we settled a lawsuit resulting in a charge of  during  we settled two lawsuits totaling  of which  was settled with issuing shares of our common stock and the remainder was paid by insurance or by us over several months 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax expense the loss from discontinued operations for was approximately  and is primarily attributed to the denial by european authorities to hear our appeal for refunding of value added taxes in germany 
income from discontinued operations for of approximately  was due to the favorable settlement of litigation pertaining to a lease 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the company s future obligations 
at december  and december   we had working capital deficits of approximately million and million  respectively 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations  cash on hand and the bank credit facility 
while we do not have any commitments for capital expenditures which come due within the next months  the merger with vertro in march  and the subsequent investment in search costs to increase the alot users and revenue compelled us to increase our outstanding borrowings 
even after extensive efforts to reduce our cost structure  including savings achieved by merging with vertro  we realized our fixed operating expenses were too high 
on january   we announced that we had received a grant of million from the state of arkansas to assist with the costs of purchasing equipment and relocating our headquarters to arkansas 
we are in the process of relocating headquarters to conway  arkansas 
in conjunction with the relocation  we will close our clearwater office and plan to sublease the former headquarters office in new york city 
we are also in the process of consolidating our data center collocation facilities in new york city into a single collocation facility in arkansas 
we believe a reduced leased space  a single collocation facility and a generally lower cost of living in arkansas will have a significant effect in lowering our operating expenses in the future 
on march  we entered into a new business financing agreement with bridge bank  for a million accounts receivable revolving credit facility the revolving credit line and a million term loan the term loan 
the revolving credit line replaced our then existing million revolving credit facility 
the new credit facility is used primarily to satisfy our working capital needs following the closing of the merger with vertro 
subject to the terms of the new agreement  we are entitled to obtain advances against the revolving credit line up to of eligible accounts receivable balances  which are generally those balances owed by us based customers that are less than days from the date of invoice  plus million up to the credit limit of million 
in addition  subject to the terms of the agreement  we are entitled to borrow up to million under the term loan portion of the credit facility  which is repayable in equal monthly installments beginning june the revolving credit line portion of the credit facility expires on march   at which time all loan advances under the revolving credit line become due and payable 
the term loan expires in february  under the terms of the new agreement  we must maintain certain depository  operating and investment accounts at bridge bank  provide bridge bank a first priority perfected security interest in all of our accounts and personal property  provide various monthly  quarterly and annual reports  and limit additional indebtedness to  of purchase money including capital leases and an additional  of all other indebtedness 
in addition  we must have maintained through may an operating profit of net income plus interest and taxes plus non cash expenses for amortization  depreciation  stock based compensation  discontinued operations  non recurring non cash items and certain closing costs associated with the merger transaction with vertro of not less than  for the immediate proceeding three month period  after may a debt service coverage ratio of at least to tested on the immediate proceeding three month period  and an asset coverage ratio of not less tahn to at all times until september  and to thereafter 
interest on the revolving credit line is payable monthly at prime plus plus a monthly maintenance fee of percentage points on the average daily account balance 
interest on the term loan bears interest at prime plus 
in connection with establishing the credit facility  we incurred fees payable to bridge bank of approximately  the agreement calls for a termination fee until the first anniversary and prepayment fee on the term loan until the first anniversary 
on june  we entered into the first business financing modification agreement with bridge bank the first amendment changing the minimum asset coverage ratio to to for the june  july and august  to for the september  to for the october  to for the november and to beginning december it also changed the minimum operating profit measured monthly on a trailing month basis to not less than  for june   for july   for august and  for september further  the first amendment required from october and thereafter that the debt service coverage ratio be at least to  on a trailing month basis and waived the event of default caused by the non compliance of the asset coverage ratio in april and may on october  we entered into the second business financing modification agreement with bridge bank the second amendment changed the minimum asset coverage ratio to to for september and october  to for november and december and to for each measuring period thereafter beginning january it also changed the minimum operating profit measured monthly on a trailing month basis to not less than  for the september measuring period and  for the october measuring period 
also changed was the minimum debt service ratio  measured monthly on a trailing month basis  to not less than to for november measuring period  to for december and to for each measuring period thereafter beginning january further  the second amendment waived the event of default caused by the non compliance of the operating profit in july and august additionally  pursuant to the second amendment  we issued bridge bank a warrant to purchase  shares of our own common stock exercisable at per share until october the warrant was valued at  and is included in our financing expense 
as of december   we had a balance outstanding of million in the term loan and million in the revolving credit line 
we were in compliance with all terms of the amended bridge bank credit facility 
we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity financings in order to fund our operations  take advantage of favorable business opportunities  develop and upgrade our technology infrastructure  develop new product and service offerings  take advantage of favorable conditions in capital markets  sell certain of our operations or respond to competitive pressures in an effort to maintain our market position 
we cannot be assured that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
if we issue additional equity  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
if we continue to generate losses and are unable to comply with the continued listing standards of nyse mkt  we could be delisted and be unable to raise additional capital at a reasonable cost 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million and availability under our revolving line of credit of approximately million 
we believe with the continued improvement in cash flow  the reduction of duplicate costs with respect to the merger with vertro and the higher limit of the new bank facility  we will have sufficient cash for the next twelve months 
cash flows operating net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  totaled approximately million compared to net cash used in operations of approximately  during the same period in in  the net loss of approximately million was offset by the non cash charge of depreciation and amortization of approximately million  a charge for stock based compensation of approximately  and an increase to the provision for doubtful accounts of approximately  an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million was the largest source of cash by operating activities in  but was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million

a working capital use of  also drove the use of cash by operating activities in additionally  cash flows from operations for the years ended december  was negatively impacted by the net results from discontinued operations of approximately  due to a settlement of litigation
