item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction ruby tuesday  inc  including its wholly owned subsidiaries rti  the company  we and or our  owns and operates ruby tuesday and lime fresh mexican grill lime fresh casual dining restaurants 
we also franchise the ruby tuesday and lime fresh concepts in select domestic and international markets 
our mission is to be the best in the bar grill segment of casual dining by delivering to our guests a high quality casual dining experience with compelling value 
while we are in the bar grill sector because of our varied menu  it is our goal to operate at the higher end of casual dining in terms of the quality of our food and service 
as of june   we owned and operated ruby tuesday restaurants located in states and the district of columbia 
our franchisees operated domestic and international ruby tuesday restaurants in states  guam  and foreign countries 
the company owned and operated restaurants are concentrated primarily in the southeast  northeast  mid atlantic  and midwest regions of the united states 
we consider these regions to be our core markets 
as of june   there were company owned and operated lime fresh restaurants  as well as five domestic and one international lime fresh restaurants operated by franchisees 
references to franchise system revenue contained in this section are presented solely for the purposes of enhancing the investor understanding of the franchise system  which includes our traditional domestic and international franchisees 
franchise system revenue is not included in  and is not  revenue of ruby tuesday  inc however  we believe that such information does provide the investor with a basis for a better understanding of our revenue from franchising activities  which includes royalties  and  in certain cases  support service income 
franchise system revenue contained in this section is based upon or derived from information that we obtain from our franchisees in our capacity as franchisor 
overview and strategies casual dining  the segment of the industry in which we operate  is intensely competitive with respect to prices  services  convenience  locations  employees  advertising and promotion  and the types and quality of food 
we compete with other food service operations  including locally owned restaurants  and other national and regional restaurant chains that offer similar types of services and products as we do 
while we are in the bar and grill sector as a result of our varied menu  we operate at the higher end of casual dining in terms of the quality of our food and service 
we believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business  strengthen our competitive position  enhance our profitability  and create value through the execution of the following strategies enhance sales and margins through repositioning of our core brand in an effort to stabilize and grow our guest counts  same restaurant sales  and profitability  we are in the early stages of new initiatives focused on promoting the ruby tuesday brand as more lively and approachable  including the introduction of new menu items  music soundscape upgrades  lighting improvements  and revitalizing the look and feel of our television advertising and other promotional materials to better reflect the variety on our menu and project a more casual  energetic  and approachable brand personality and dining experience 
our marketing strategy historically has focused mainly on print promotions  digital media and local marketing programs  with a minimal amount spent on television 
however  based on the results from television test markets in fiscal  we deployed a more balanced marketing program in fiscal comprised of a mixture of network and national cable television advertising in tandem with direct mail and other print and electronic promotions 
we believe that having a more lively and approachable perception of our restaurants  communicated through television advertising expense levels more in line with our competitive peer group in tandem with a more balanced approach on our promotional strategies will position us for improvements in same restaurant sales in the future from repeat and new guests 
in order to fund the incremental television advertising  during fiscal we consulted with a leading enterprise improvement firm to assist us in identifying potential savings opportunities in a number of key areas including procurement  occupancy  and maintenance costs 
the majority of these cost savings are being reinvested into our television marketing programs 
focus on low capital intensive potential growth in the fast casual sector we have been focused on growing our company in a low capital intensive manner in the fast casual sector through lime fresh  our mexican fast casual concept 
we initially opened lime fresh restaurants under a licensing agreement and  after over a year of experience that enabled us to better understand the concept s positioning and potential in the high quality fast casual segment  we acquired the business for million in the fourth quarter of fiscal since we believed we could more effectively grow the concept if we owned it 
the fast casual segment of our industry is a proven and growing segment where demand exceeds supply  and we believe opening smaller  inline locations under the lime fresh brand provides a low capital intensive potential growth option for us 
while the concept is still in its early stages  we believe it has the potential to generate attractive returns for us if we are able to realize our revenue and profitability targets 
we opened nine company owned lime fresh restaurants during fiscal strengthen our balance sheet to facilitate growth and value creation during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we further strengthened our balance sheet and created additional financial flexibility by issuing million in senior unsecured notes with an eight year maturity 
as a result of the transaction  we were able to pay off all of our outstanding debt with the exception of certain of our mortgage debt from previous franchise partnership acquisitions  reduce our revolver commitment size from million to million  obtain attractive interest rates  extend the maturity date of the majority of our debt for up to eight years  and build excess cash which we will reinvest in the future 
we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and have a sufficient amount of liquidity 
our strong balance sheet is supported by a high quality portfolio of owned real estate  and during fiscal we commenced a sale leaseback program on a portion of our properties for three primary reasons 
first  the program enabled us through a series of transactions to corroborate the estimated market value of our entire remaining real estate portfolio for both our equity and debt holders 
second  the program enabled us to generate excess cash during fiscal  when our free cash flow was at lower levels  in order to opportunistically pay off debt and repurchase our shares  which we would have been unable to do absent the sale leaseback transactions 
third  we were able to complete the sale leaseback transactions at low capitalization rates with minimal tax leakage 
our sale leaseback program  which was completed subsequent to the end of fiscal  enabled us to raise approximately million of gross proceeds through monetizing restaurants during the entire program tenure  with million of these proceeds being realized in fiscal through the monetization of restaurants 
the sale leaseback proceeds were utilized for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures debt reduction  and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
we have no plans at this time to pursue any additional sale leaseback transactions 
see further discussion of our sale leaseback transactions in the investing activities section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
our objective over the next several years is to continue to reduce outstanding debt levels in order to reduce our leverage  focus on prudent lime fresh restaurant development  and opportunistically repurchase outstanding shares under our share repurchase program 
our success in the key strategic initiatives outlined above should enable us to improve both our return on assets and return on equity  and to create additional shareholder value 
our fiscal year ends on the first tuesday following may and  as is the case once every five or six years  we have a week year 
fiscal was a week year 
all other years discussed throughout this md a contained weeks 
in fiscal  the rd week added million to restaurant sales and operating revenue and to diluted earnings per share in our consolidated statement of operations 
our same restaurant sales for company owned ruby tuesday restaurants decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and our diluted loss per share was in fiscal compared to diluted loss per share of in fiscal throughout this md a  we discuss our fiscal financial results in detail  provide insight for fiscal years and  as well as discuss known events  uncertainties  and trends 
we believe our commentary provides insight as to the factors which impacted our performance 
we remind you  that  in order to best obtain an understanding of our financial performance during the last three fiscal years  this md a should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in part ii  item of this annual report on form k

b as the lime fresh concept restaurants have not been under ruby tuesday management for an amount of time sufficient to meet our same restaurant definition  company same restaurant sales and average restaurant volume information is for our ruby tuesday concept only 
our company restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended june  decreased to  million compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily a result of the impact of a rd week in fiscal  which contributed million in revenue  restaurant closures since the prior year  and a decrease in same restaurant sales at company owned ruby tuesday restaurants  offset by an increase in lime fresh concept revenues of million due to our acquisition of seven lime fresh restaurants on april  and a net increase of seven additional lime fresh restaurants since then 
the decrease in same restaurant sales is attributable to lower guest counts partially offset by an increase in average net check during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in average net check was primarily the result of reduced discounts and price increases since the prior year 
our company restaurant sales and operating revenue for the year ended june  increased to  million compared to the prior year 
the increase primarily resulted from the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees in fiscal coupled with the revenue associated with the rd week in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in ruby tuesday concept same restaurant sales 
included in our restaurant sales and operating revenue for fiscal is million of restaurant sales for restaurants acquired from our franchisees during fiscal these same restaurants generated sales of million in fiscal from the various dates of acquisition through may  the fiscal decrease in same restaurant sales was attributable to lower guest counts  which was partially offset by an increase in average net check compared with the prior year 
the increase in average net check was a result of menu price increases and a shift in menu mix 
franchise development and license fees received are recognized when we have substantially performed all material services and the restaurant has opened for business 
franchise royalties generally to of monthly sales are recognized as franchise revenue on the accrual basis 
franchise revenue increased to million in fiscal and decreased to million in fiscal franchise revenue is predominantly comprised of domestic and international royalties  which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in franchise royalties in fiscal is due in part to higher domestic franchise royalties attributable to our lime fresh franchise restaurants and higher international franchise royalties due to increased sales at certain international restaurants compared to fiscal the decrease in franchise royalties in fiscal is due to a million decline in royalties from our traditional domestic franchisees due in part to a decline in same restaurant sales for domestic franchise ruby tuesday restaurants during fiscal and a million reduction in royalties from our franchise partnerships due to the acquisition of restaurants from our franchise partnerships during fiscal under our accounting policy  we do not recognize franchise fee revenue for any franchise with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary and the franchise has borrowed directly from us 
we also do not recognize additional franchise fee revenue from franchisees with fees in excess of days past due 
accordingly  we have deferred recognition of a portion of franchise revenue from certain franchises 
unearned income for franchise fees was million and negligible as of june  and june   respectively  which are included in accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
the increase in unearned income is primarily attributable to unearned fees associated with a traditional domestic franchisee that emerged from bankruptcy during the current year 
total franchise restaurant sales are shown in the table below 
franchise restaurant sales in thousands ruby tuesday concept lime fresh concept total franchise restaurant sales a franchise restaurant sales growth percentage a includes sales of all domestic and international franchised ruby tuesday and lime fresh restaurants 
the and decreases in franchise restaurant sales for fiscal and  respectively  are primarily due to the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees during fiscal segment profit during fiscal  our new president and chief executive officer  who is our chief operating decision maker codm  with the assistance of our senior management  began to review discrete financial information for both the ruby tuesday and lime fresh restaurant concepts to assess performance and allocate resources 
we consider the ruby tuesday and lime fresh concepts to be our reportable segments as we do not believe they have similar economic and other characteristics to be aggregated into a single reportable segment 
segment profit by reportable segment for fiscal   and are as follows in thousands segment profit ruby tuesday concept lime fresh concept total segment profit segment profit for the ruby tuesday concept decreased million from fiscal to million in fiscal due to increases in advertising spending of million  as we increased our television spending  offset by decreases in closures and impairment expenses of million due to costs in fiscal associated with our decision to close ruby tuesday restaurants 
segment losses for the lime fresh concept increased million from fiscal to million in fiscal due to increased closure and impairment charges of million  primarily associated with four underperforming lime fresh concept restaurants still open and our new management s decision to close four additional lime fresh restaurants during the year 
excluding the increased closure and impairment charges of million  the segment losses for the lime fresh concept would have increased million as compared to the prior year 
the increase in lime fresh segment losses during fiscal excluding closures and impairments was primarily due to lower revenues on a per unit basis  which resulted in the loss of cost leverage on the operating side 
additionally  during the current year we closed four of our internally developed restaurants which were not meeting our revenue or profitability expectations  and whose operating performance was more dilutive to the fiscal segment profit than the prior year 
we have embarked on a number of initiatives during the fourth quarter of fiscal which we believe have the potential to generate incremental sales  including engaging a company to assist with local store marketing efforts  testing menu boards at certain locations to improve the ordering process  and increasing the flavor profile of certain entrees 
segment profit for the ruby tuesday concept decreased million from fiscal to million in fiscal due to increases in advertising spending of million primarily as a result of increased television advertising  higher closures and impairment expenses of million as a result of our decision to close to ruby tuesday restaurants  and a decrease in company owned ruby tuesday concept same restaurants sales 
segment losses for the lime fresh concept increased million to million due to underperformance of several of our first lime fresh concept restaurants  four of which were closed during fiscal the following is a reconciliation of segment profit to loss income from continuing operations before taxes for fiscal   and in thousands segment profit less depreciation and amortization unallocated general and administrative expenses preopening expenses goodwill and trademark impairments interest expense  net other expense  net loss income from continuing operations before income taxes operating profits the following table sets forth selected restaurant operating data as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  for the periods indicated

for fiscal  pre tax loss from continuing operations was million or of total revenue  as compared to pre tax income from continuing operations of million or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in same restaurant sales of at company owned ruby tuesday restaurants  a goodwill impairment charge of million  higher closures and impairments million and interest expense million  and increases  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue or total revenue  as appropriate  of payroll and related costs  and selling  general  and administrative  net

in the paragraphs that follow  we discuss in more detail the components of the changes in pre tax loss income from continuing operations for years ended june  and june  as compared to the comparable prior year 
because a significant portion of the costs recorded in the cost of merchandise  payroll and related costs  other restaurant operating costs  and depreciation categories are either variable or highly correlate with the number of restaurants we operate  we evaluate our trends by comparing the costs as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  as well as the absolute dollar change  to the comparable prior year

for the year ended june   the absolute dollar decrease in cost of merchandise was the result of cost savings negotiated with our primary food distributor coupled with renegotiated contracts and product specification changes on several items with certain vendors since fiscal restaurant closures further contributed to the reduction in cost of merchandise 
partially offsetting these decreases were cost increases on beef  poultry  and certain other products since the prior year

payroll and related costs payroll and related costs decreased million from the prior year to million for the year ended june  as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  payroll and related costs remained consistent with the prior year at 
for the year ended june   the absolute dollar decrease in payroll and related costs was due to restaurant closures  decreases in hourly labor as a result of lower training costs and new staffing guidelines for certain positions in our restaurants  and favorable workers compensation claims experience 
these were partially offset by minimum wage increases in certain states  higher field bonus  and higher management labor due to merit increases since the same periods of the prior year

excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  payroll and related costs decreased million 
for the year ended june   the decrease in absolute dollars not attributable to the restaurant acquisitions is primarily a result of new staffing guidelines for certain positions in our restaurants and lowered staffing levels attributable to reduced guest traffic since fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the increase in payroll and related costs for the year ended june  compared to fiscal is due to higher management labor as a result of merit increases during the current year  minimum wage increases in several states since the prior year  and higher futa tax owed following the failure of several states to repay the federal government for unemployment insurance loans  coupled with the impact on net sales of increased value focused promotional activity and loss of leveraging with lower sales volumes

for the year ended june   the decrease in other restaurant operating costs related to the following in thousands utilities supplies other decreases repairs rent and leasing net reductions for the year ended june   the absolute dollar decrease was primarily a result of lower utilities based on reduced rates and lower supplies expense due to negotiated contract savings with certain vendors 
these decreases were partially offset by higher repairs expense as we transitioned to a new maintenance agreement with a third party provider during the current year and higher rent and leasing charges as a result of sale leaseback transactions

partially offsetting these decreases are net gains on restaurant acquisitions as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and increases in rent and leasing expense due to the sale leaseback of ten restaurants during fiscal depreciation depreciation expense decreased million to million for the year ended june   compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  depreciation expense decreased from to 
in terms of both absolute dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  the decrease for the year ended june  is primarily due to assets that became fully depreciated since the same periods of the prior year coupled with sale leaseback transactions and restaurant closures 
depreciation expense increased million to million for the year ended june   compared to fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales and operating revenue  depreciation expense decreased from to 
excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  depreciation expense decreased million 
for fiscal  the increase in depreciation expense is due to depreciation on the restaurants acquired from franchisees in fiscal  which was partially offset by reduced depreciation on assets that became fully depreciated or were retired from service since fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses  net increased million from the prior year to million for the year ended june  the increase for the year ended june  is due to higher advertising costs million  primarily as a result of increased television advertising 
at the start of fiscal  we deployed a television marketing program which covered the entire system of restaurants for a portion of each quarter with the remaining portion of the quarter supplemented by high end direct mail and other promotions 
the higher advertising costs were partially offset by lower general and administrative costs million due primarily to reduced consulting fees from the prior year 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  net increased million from fiscal to million for the year ended june  excluding the million increase from the restaurants acquired in fiscal  selling  general and administrative  net increased million 
the increase for the year ended june  is due to higher advertising costs million  primarily as a result of increased television advertising  coupled with higher general and administrative expense million 
the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal was due to higher management labor million as a result of executive severance payments and accruals  consulting fees million  primarily relating to cost control projects  lower franchise support service fee income million as a result of franchise partnership acquisitions during fiscal  and higher support center bonus expense million 
these were partially offset by lower share based compensation expense million as a result of the inclusion within a portion of the fiscal share based compensation award of performance conditions for which we expect less than full achievement  compared to the fiscal share based compensation award which contained only service conditions 
closures and impairments  net closures and impairments decreased million to million for the year ended june   as compared to the prior year 
the decrease was due to lower restaurant impairment charges and lease reserve expense from continuing operations million and million  respectively and reductions in other closing expense million 
closures and impairments increased million to million for the year ended june   as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher restaurant impairment charges million due to management s decision in fiscal to close approximately to restaurants  of which were closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal of the million in restaurant impairment charges recorded during fiscal  million is a result of impairments related to the restaurant closures 
the remaining increase is due to higher closed restaurant lease reserve expense million and other closing expense million  which were partially offset by an increase in gains during the current year on the sale of surplus properties million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our closures and impairment charges recorded during fiscal   and goodwill and trademark impairments we concluded during the fourth quarter of fiscal that the goodwill associated with our lime fresh concept was fully impaired and the lime fresh trademark was partially impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a fourth quarter fiscal non cash charge of million million  net of tax representing the full value of our lime fresh concept goodwill and a non cash charge of million representing a partial impairment of the lime fresh trademark 
we concluded during fiscal that the goodwill associated with our ruby tuesday concept was fully impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge during fiscal of million million  net of tax 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our fiscal and goodwill and trademark impairment charges 
interest expense  net interest expense  net increased million to million for the year ended june   primarily due to interest expense on our senior notes which was partially offset by lower expense on our other debt due to pay downs since the prior year 
interest expense  net increased million to million for the year ended june   primarily due to higher interest expense on our mortgage obligations outstanding due to the acquisition of restaurants from the franchise partnerships in fiscal and prepayment premiums on the payoff during fiscal of the series b senior notes and certain mortgage obligations 
discontinued operations in an effort to focus primarily on the successful sales turnaround of our core ruby tuesday concept and secondly  to improve the financial performance of our lime fresh concept  on january   the board of directors of ruby tuesday  inc approved management s plan to close all marlin ray s restaurants as well as the company s one wok hay restaurant in the third quarter of fiscal we closed these restaurants on january  additionally  on the same date we announced our intention to seek a buyer for our two truffles restaurants 
no buyer suitable to our landlords was found and we consequently opted  on april   to close the restaurants instead 
as a result of these decisions  pre tax charges of million were recognized for asset impairments  lease reserves  and other closing costs within closures and impairments expense from discontinued operations for the year ended june  we have classified the results of operations of our company owned marlin ray s  wok hay  and truffles concepts as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the results of operations of our discontinued operations are as follows in thousands june  june  may  restaurant sales and operating revenue loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes loss from discontinued operations provision benefit for income taxes from continuing operations for fiscal we have recorded an income tax expense from continuing operations of million  compared with an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million in the prior year 
included in the income tax expense from continuing operations for fiscal are employment tax credits  primarily the fica tip credit and the work opportunity tax credit wotc  of million 
also included in the fiscal tax expense from continuing operations is a charge of million to establish an income tax valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets  including the deferred tax asset established for the fiscal tax credits 
under accounting standards codification  income taxes  we are required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result of losses from discontinued operations  as well as goodwill and trademark impairment charges  among other charges  we now have a three year cumulative pre tax loss 
a cumulative pre tax loss is given more weight than projections of future income  and a recent historical cumulative loss is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome 
before consideration of the valuation allowance expense  we had an income tax benefit of million  including the tax credits 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be released in future years when we consider that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
to form a conclusion that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  we will need to generate a three year cumulative pre tax income  and we will need to evaluate whether or not all available evidence  such as future taxable income  reversal of temporary differences  and other tax planning strategies provides sufficient positive evidence to offset any other potential negative evidence that may exist at such time 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is released  we would record an income tax benefit for the portion or all of the deferred tax valuation allowance released 
we recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of million in fiscal compared to income tax expense from continuing operations of million in fiscal the change in income taxes was primarily attributable to the fact that the company reported a loss from continuing operations in fiscal compared to income from continuing operations in fiscal fica tip credits and work opportunity tax credits generated in fiscal increased the effective tax rate above the statutory rate 
offsetting this was the write off of goodwill  million of which we estimated would be nondeductible for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
the following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in thousands 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided used by investing activities net cash used by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our cash provided by operations is generally derived from cash receipts generated by our restaurant customers and franchisees

cash provided by operating activities for fiscal decreased million from the prior year to million 
the decrease is due primarily to lower ebitda as a result of a decrease in same restaurant sales at company owned ruby tuesday restaurants and increases in amounts spent on media advertising approximately million  coupled with increases in amounts spent to acquire inventory relating primarily to purchases of lobster and crab to ensure adequate supply approximately million  higher cash paid for taxes million  and higher cash paid for interest million due primarily to interest on the senior notes 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal decreased million from fiscal to million 
the decrease is due to lower ebitda as a result of a decrease in same restaurant sales at company owned ruby tuesday restaurants and higher cash paid for interest million as a result of increased interest on our mortgage obligations outstanding due to the acquisition of restaurants from the franchise partnerships in fiscal and prepayment premiums on the payoff during fiscal of the series b senior notes and certain mortgage obligations 
these were partially offset by a reduction in cash paid for income taxes million and reduced amounts spent to acquire inventory 
our working capital and current ratio as of june  were million and  respectively 
included within the current assets section of our consolidated balance sheet at june   is cash and cash equivalents of million  which primarily consists of excess cash raised in connection with our fiscal sale leasebacks coupled with the senior notes issuance during the fourth quarter of fiscal investing activities we require capital principally for the maintenance and upkeep of our existing restaurants  limited new restaurant construction  investments in technology  equipment  remodeling of existing restaurants  and on occasion for the acquisition of franchisees or other restaurant concepts

in addition  proceeds from the disposal of assets produced million  million  and million of cash in fiscal   and  respectively  following actions taken to more aggressively market surplus properties in order to pay down debt

see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions and similar transactions which have closed subsequent to june  as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of lime fresh  including the assets of seven lime fresh concept restaurants  the royalty stream from five lime fresh concept franchised restaurants one of which was not yet open  and the lime fresh brand s intellectual property for million 
as also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  during fiscal  we spent million  plus assumed debt  to acquire the remaining member or limited partnership interests of franchise partnerships which collectively operated restaurants  one additional restaurant from a twelfth franchise partnership  and three restaurants from a traditional domestic franchisee 
capital expenditures for fiscal are projected to be approximately million to million 
we intend to fund our investing activities with cash currently on hand  cash provided by operations  cash from the final three sale leaseback transactions  or borrowings on our five year revolving credit agreement the credit facility 
financing activities historically our primary sources of cash have been operating activities and refranchising transactions 
when these alone have not provided sufficient funds for both our capital and other needs  we have obtained funds through the issuance of indebtedness or through the issuance of additional shares of common stock 
our current borrowings and credit facilities are described below 
on may   we entered into an indenture the indenture among the company  certain subsidiaries of the company as guarantors and wells fargo bank  national association as trustee  governing the company s million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at a discount of million  which is being amortized using the effective interest method over the eight year term of the notes 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
they rank equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness 
the senior notes are effectively subordinated to all of our secured debt  including borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes 
interest on the senior notes is calculated at per annum  payable semiannually on each may and november  commencing november   to holders of record on the may or november immediately preceding the interest payment date 
accrued interest on the senior notes and our other long term debt and capital lease obligations is included in accrued liabilities rent and other in our consolidated balance sheets 
the senior notes mature on may  at any time prior to may   we may redeem the senior notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus an applicable make whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest 
at any time on or after may   we may redeem the senior notes  in whole or in part  at the redemption prices specified in the indenture plus accrued and unpaid interest 
at any time prior to may   we may redeem up to of the senior notes from the proceeds of certain equity offerings 
there is no sinking fund for the senior notes 
the indenture contains covenants that limit  among other things  our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to i incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  ii declare or pay dividends  redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders  iii make certain investments  iv create liens or use assets as security in other transactions  v merge or consolidate  or sell  transfer  lease or dispose of substantially all of their assets  vi enter into transactions with affiliates  and vii sell or transfer certain assets 
these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications  as described in the indenture  and certain covenants will not apply at any time when the senior notes are rated investment grade by the rating agencies  as defined in the indenture 
the indenture also provides for events of default  which  if any of them occurs  would permit or require the principal  premium  if any  interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding senior notes to be due and payable immediately 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  we agreed to register with the sec notes having substantially identical terms as the senior notes  as part of an offer to exchange freely tradable exchange notes for the senior notes 
the exchange offer was consummated on may on august   we entered into the third amendment to our five year revolving credit agreement the credit facility discussed below which  among other things  allows us to repurchase up to million of the senior notes in any fiscal year 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of the senior notes for million plus million of accrued interest 
we realized a gain of million on these transactions 
the balance on the senior notes was million at june  as a result of these repurchases 
on december   we entered into the credit facility  under which we could borrow up to million with the option to increase our capacity by million to million 
on may   we entered into the second amendment to our credit facility to  among other things  reduce the maximum aggregate revolving commitment to million  secure the credit facility with a lien over the equity interests of certain subsidiaries  modify certain financial covenants and ratios and permit the issuance of the senior notes 
the terms of the credit facility provide for a million letter of credit subcommitment 
the credit facility also includes a million franchise facility subcommitment the franchise facility subcommitment  which covered our previous guarantees of franchise debt 
the franchise facility subcommitment matures no later than december  all amounts guaranteed under the franchise facility subcommitment have been settled 
the interest rate charged on borrowings pursuant to the credit facility can vary depending on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our base rate for borrowings is defined to be the higher of bank of america s prime rate  the federal funds rate plus  or an adjusted libo rate plus  plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
the applicable margin for our eurodollar borrowings ranges from to depending on our total debt to ebitdar ratio 
a commitment fee for the account of each lender at a rate ranging from to depending on our total debt to ebitdar ratio on the daily amount of the unused revolving commitment of such lender is payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and on the termination date of the credit facility 
on the first day after the end of each calendar quarter until the termination date of the credit facility  we are required to pay a letter of credit fee for the account of each lender with respect to such lender s participation in each letter of credit 
the letter of credit fee accrues at the applicable margin for eurodollar loans then in effect on the average daily amount of such lender s letter of credit exposure excluding any portion attributable to unreimbursed letter of credit disbursements attributable to such letter of credit during the period from and including the date of issuance of such letter of credit to but excluding the date on which such letter of credit expires or is drawn in full 
besides the commitment fee and the letter of credit fee  we are also required to pay a fronting fee on the daily amount of the letter of credit exposure excluding any portion attributable to unreimbursed letter of credit disbursements on the tenth day after the end of each calendar quarter until the termination date of the credit facility 
we must also pay standard fees with respect to issuance  amendment  renewal or extension of any letter of credit or processing of drawings thereunder 
we are entitled to make voluntary prepayments of our borrowings under the credit facility at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty 
subject to certain exceptions  mandatory prepayments will be required upon occurrence of certain events  including the revolving credit exposure of all lenders exceeding the aggregate revolving commitment then in effect  sales of certain assets and any additional debt issuances 
under the terms of the credit facility  we had no borrowings outstanding at either june  or june  after consideration of letters of credit outstanding  we had million available under the credit facility as of june  the credit facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that  among others  limit or restrict our ability to incur liens  engage in mergers or other fundamental changes  make acquisitions  investments  loans and advances  pay dividends or other distributions  sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  enter into burdensome agreements or certain hedging agreements  amend organizational documents  change accounting practices  incur additional indebtedness and prepay other indebtedness 
in addition  under the credit facility  we are required to comply with financial covenants relating to the maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of june  the terms of the credit facility require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of no more than to through the fiscal quarter ended june  and to thereafter and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to through and including the fiscal quarter ending june  and to thereafter 
the credit facility terminates on december  upon the occurrence of an event of default  the lenders may terminate the loan commitments  accelerate all loans and exercise any of their rights under the credit facility and any ancillary loan documents 
our million in mortgage loan obligations as of june  consists of various loans acquired upon franchise acquisitions 
these loans  which mature between may and november  have balances which range from million to million and interest rates of to 
many of the properties acquired from franchisees collateralize the loans outstanding 
during fiscal and  we repurchased million and million shares of rti common stock  respectively  at an aggregate cost of million and million  respectively 
as of june   the total number of shares authorized to be repurchased was million 
we did not repurchase any shares of rti common stock during fiscal additionally  there were no dividends paid during fiscal   or significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments long term financial obligations were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years notes payable and other long term debt  including current maturities a senior unsecured notes a interest b operating leases c purchase obligations d pension obligations e total f a see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our debt 
b amounts represent contractual interest payments on our fixed rate debt instruments 
interest payments on our variable rate notes payable with balances of million  as of june  have been excluded from the amounts shown above  primarily because the balances outstanding can fluctuate monthly 
additionally  the amounts shown above include interest payments on the senior notes at the current interest rate of c this amount includes operating leases totaling million for which sublease income from franchisees or others is expected 
certain of these leases obligate us to pay maintenance costs  utilities  real estate taxes  and insurance  which are excluded from the amounts shown above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
d the amounts for purchase obligations include cash commitments under contract for food items and supplies  advertising  utility contracts  and other miscellaneous commitments 
e see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
f this amount excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations 
commercial commitments were as follows as of june  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years letters of credit divestiture guarantees total at june   we had divestiture guarantees  which arose in fiscal  when our shareholders approved the distribution of our family dining restaurant business morrison fresh cooking  inc  mfc and our health care food and nutrition services business morrison health care  inc  mhc 
subsequent to that date piccadilly cafeterias  inc 
piccadilly acquired mfc and compass group compass acquired mhc 
as agreed upon at the time of the distribution  we have been contingently liable for payments to mfc and mhc employees retiring under mfc s and mhc s versions of the management retirement plan and the executive supplemental pension plan the two non qualified defined benefit plans for the accrued benefits earned by those participants as of march we estimated our divestiture guarantees at june  to be million for employee benefit plans all of which resides with mhc following piccadilly s bankruptcy in fiscal 
we believe the likelihood of being required to make payments for mhc s portion to be remote due to the size and financial strength of mhc and compass 
off balance sheet arrangements see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating leases and prior year franchise partnership guarantees 
critical accounting policies our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make subjective or complex judgments that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of any individual restaurant when the cash flows of such restaurant have deteriorated and we believe the probability of continued operating and cash flow losses indicate that the net book value of the restaurant may not be recoverable 
in performing the review for recoverability  we consider the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the restaurant and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the restaurant  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the net book value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
fair value is market participant based upon estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use through the expected disposal date and the expected salvage value 
if a restaurant that has been open for at least one full year shows negative cash flow results  we prepare a plan to reverse the negative performance 
under our policies  recurring or projected annual negative cash flow signals a potential impairment 
both qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments 
at june   we had restaurants that had been open more than one year with rolling month negative cash flows  of which have been impaired to salvage value 
of the which remained  we reviewed the plans to improve cash flows at each of the restaurants and determined no impairment was necessary 
the remaining net book value of these restaurants was million at june  should sales at these restaurants not improve within a reasonable period of time  further impairment charges are possible 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows  including cash flows from continuing use  terminal value  closure costs  salvage value  and sublease income 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from our estimates 
we perform tests for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a variety of methodologies in conducting these impairment assessments  including cash flow analyses that are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use  estimates of sales proceeds and other measures  such as fair market price of our common stock  as evidenced by closing trading price 
where applicable  we use an appropriate discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows 
if market conditions deteriorate  or if operating results decline unexpectedly  we may be required to record impairment charges 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we tested the goodwill associated with our lime fresh concept during the fourth quarter of fiscal the results of the first step indicated a potential goodwill impairment as the fair value of the lime fresh concept was less than its carrying value 
we determined the fair value of the lime fresh concept using the discounted cash flow method 
the results of the second step indicated that all goodwill recorded in connection with the lime fresh acquisition was impaired as the implied fair value of the goodwill was less than the carrying value by more than the amount recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at the time of the testing 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a charge of million million  net of tax representing the full value of our lime fresh concept goodwill 
as also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  using an approach similar to that for goodwill  we tested the lime fresh trademark for impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal we determined that the lime fresh trademark was partially impaired and recorded a fiscal charge of million accordingly 
our normal timing for the annual testing of goodwill is as of the end of our third fiscal quarter 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  given our lowered stock price and the continuation of negative same restaurant sales in fiscal  we tested our ruby tuesday concept goodwill throughout the year and determined it to be fully impaired 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million million  net of tax during fiscal  representing the full value of our ruby tuesday concept goodwill 
income tax valuation allowances and tax accruals we record deferred tax assets for various items and a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets when current available information raises doubt as to their ultimate realization 
despite the existence of long carryforward periods for some of our largest deferred tax assets  such as unused employment tax credits and federal and or state net operating losses  and a history of realizing our deferred tax assets by utilizing those credits and losses in subsequent or carryback years  a three year cumulative pre tax loss is an example of negative evidence that raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
to determine the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance  we schedule a year by year estimation of the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences in order to determine the availability of future taxable income which would allow for the realization of our existing deferred tax assets 
while we are able to incorporate tax planning strategies into our analysis  we do not factor projected future income until such time that the positive evidence supporting realization outweighs the negative evidence most significantly  the three year cumulative pre tax loss 
we recorded a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
included in income tax expense from continuing operations is the expense from the additional valuation allowance of million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
additionally  a valuation allowance expense of million was included in income tax expense from discontinued operations in fiscal given that we recorded pre tax income in fiscal and pre tax losses in fiscal and  we will likely not be able to reverse the significant valuation allowance recorded in fiscal in the near future 
upon such time that we are able to reverse the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  income tax expense will be reduced  and net income will correspondingly be increased  by the amount we are able to reverse 
segment reporting operating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities with discrete financial information available that is regularly reviewed by the codm in order to assess performance and allocate resources 
our codm is the company s president and chief executive officer 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined our ruby tuesday concept and lime fresh concept are reportable operating segments 
discontinued operations as previously discussed in this md a  in an effort to focus primarily on the successful sales turnaround of our core ruby tuesday concept and secondly  to improve the financial performance of our lime fresh concept  on january   the board of directors of ruby tuesday  inc approved management s plan to close all marlin ray s restaurants as well as the company s one wok hay restaurant in the third quarter of fiscal we closed these restaurants on january  additionally  on the same date we announced our intention to seek a buyer for our two truffles restaurants 
no buyer suitable to our landlords was found and we consequently opted  on april   to close the restaurants instead 
as a result of these decisions and in accordance with gaap  we have included the results of operations of the discontinued marlin ray s  wok hay  and truffles concepts within discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income 
share based employee compensation share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock awards based on the closing price of our common stock on the date prior to approval of the award by our board of directors 
the majority of our stock option awards outstanding as of june  were measured at their grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
during fiscal we awarded performance based stock options to our current ceo and estimated the grant date fair value using the monte carlo simulation method 
both the black scholes option pricing model and the monte carlo simulation method require various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation 
business combinations we account for business combinations using the acquisition method  which requires  among other things  that most assets and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition date fair values 
we record goodwill when the purchase price exceeds the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the determination of estimated fair values of assets and liabilities requires significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the estimated future cash flows  estimated useful lives of assets  and appropriate discount rates 
lease obligations we lease a significant number of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the earlier of the restaurant open date or the commencement of rent payments 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon possession of the premises  and we record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as deferred escalating minimum rent 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments  called contingent rents  when the associated restaurants sales volumes exceed agreed upon levels 
we recognize contingent rental expense in annual as well as interim periods prior to the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rental expense  provided that achievement of that target is considered probable 
we record the estimated future lease obligations on closed leased restaurants for which we have not sublet or settled the lease with the respective landlord as of a quarter end date 
inherent in these estimates is an assumption on the time period we anticipate it will take to reach a settlement with our landlord or to execute on a sublease agreement 
we calculate the lease obligation as the present value of future minimum net lease or settlement payments using a discount rate that takes into account the remaining time period prior to the estimated date of resolution 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our estimated lease obligations for closed restaurants as of june  and june  were million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition for franchisees we charge our franchisees various monthly fees that are calculated as a percentage of the respective franchise s monthly sales 
our ruby tuesday concept franchise agreements allow us to charge up to a royalty fee  a support service fee  a marketing and purchasing fee  and an advertising fee of up to 
we defer recognition of franchise fee revenue for any franchise with negative cash flows at times when the negative cash flows are deemed to be anything other than temporary 
we also do not recognize additional franchise fee revenue from franchisees with fees in excess of days past due 
unearned income for franchise fees was million and negligible as of june  and june   respectively  which is included in accrued liabilities rent and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
estimated liability for self insurance we self insure a portion of our current and past losses from workers compensation and general liability claims 
we have stop loss insurance for individual claims for workers compensation and general liability in excess of stated loss amounts 
insurance liabilities are recorded based on third party actuarial estimates of the ultimate incurred losses  net of payments made 
the estimates themselves are based on standard actuarial techniques that incorporate both the historical loss experience of the company and supplemental information as appropriate 
the analysis performed in calculating the estimated liability is subject to various assumptions including  but not limited to  a the quality of historical loss and exposure information  b the reliability of historical loss experience to serve as a predictor of future experience  c the reasonableness of insurance trend factors and governmental indices as applied to the company  and d projected payrolls and revenue 
as claims develop  the actual ultimate losses may differ from actuarial estimates 
therefore  an analysis is performed quarterly to determine if modifications to the accrual are required 
known events  uncertainties  and trends financial strategy and stock repurchase plan our financial strategy is to utilize a prudent amount of debt  including operating leases  letters of credit  and any guarantees  to minimize the weighted average cost of capital while allowing financial flexibility 
this financial flexibility has periodically allowed us to repurchase our common stock 
during the year ended june   we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
as of june   the total number of remaining shares authorized to be repurchased was million 
to the extent not funded with cash on hand  cash from operating activities  or proceeds from stock option exercises  future repurchases  if any  may be funded by sale leaseback transactions and borrowings on the credit facility 
the repurchase of shares in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future 
repurchases of senior notes and mortgage loan payoffs on august   we entered into an amendment of our credit facility which allows us to prepay up to million of indebtedness in any fiscal year to various holders of the senior notes 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we repurchased million of the senior notes during fiscal for million plus million of accrued interest 
we realized a million gain on these transactions 
as of the date of this filing  we may repurchase an additional million of the senior notes during the remainder of fiscal future repurchases of the senior notes  if any  will be funded with available cash on hand  additional sale leaseback transactions  or borrowings on the credit facility 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we repurchased million of the senior notes and prepaid and retired various mortgage loan obligations subsequent to june  sale leaseback transactions over the last several fiscal quarters  we have been pursuing sale leaseback transactions on a portion of our real estate in order to create financial flexibility 
our sale leaseback program  which was completed subsequent to the end of fiscal  enabled us to raise approximately million of gross proceeds through monetizing restaurants during the entire program tenure  with million of these proceeds being realized in fiscal through the monetization of restaurants 
the sale leaseback proceeds were utilized for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  debt reduction  and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
we have no plans at this time to pursue any additional sale leaseback transactions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of sale leaseback transactions which occurred during fiscal and and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of sale leaseback transactions which occurred subsequent to june  but prior to the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
dividends during fiscal  our board of directors approved a dividend policy as an additional means of returning capital to our shareholders 
the payment of a dividend in any particular future period and the actual amount thereof remain at the discretion of the board of directors  and no assurance can be given that dividends will be paid in the future 
fiscal year our fiscal year will contain weeks and end on june  impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  supplies  utilities  real estate  and construction costs could adversely impact our operating results 
historically  we have been able to recover certain inflationary cost increases through increased menu prices coupled with more efficient purchasing practices and productivity improvements 
competitive pressures may limit our ability to completely recover such cost increases 
historically  the effect of inflation has not significantly impacted our net income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
the interest rate charged on our credit facility can vary based on the interest rate option we choose to utilize 
our base rate for borrowings is defined to be the higher of bank of america s prime lending rate  the federal funds rate plus  or an adjusted libo rate plus  plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
the applicable margin for our eurodollar borrowings ranges from to 
as of june   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in short term interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of an insignificant amount per year  assuming a consistent capital structure 
many of the ingredients used in the products we sell in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
this volatility may be due to factors outside our control such as weather and seasonality 
we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients 
historically  and subject to competitive market conditions  we have been able to mitigate the negative impact of price volatility through adjustments to average check or menu mix
