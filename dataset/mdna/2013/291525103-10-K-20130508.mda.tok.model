item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general the following discussion pertains to emmis communications corporation ecc and its subsidiaries collectively  emmis or the company 
we own and operate radio and publishing properties located in the united states 
our revenues are mostly affected by the advertising rates our entities charge  as advertising sales represent more than of our consolidated revenues 
these rates are in large part based on our entities ability to attract audiences subscribers in demographic groups targeted by their advertisers 
arbitron inc generally measures radio station ratings weekly for markets measured by the portable people meter tm and four times a year for markets measured by diaries 
because audience ratings in a station s local market are critical to the station s financial success  our strategy is to use market research  advertising and promotion to attract and retain audiences in each station s chosen demographic target group 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are usually lowest in our fourth fiscal quarter 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  stations typically exchange advertising time for goods or services  which can be used by the station in its business operations 
these barter transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the product or service received 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
the following table summarizes the sources of our revenues for the past three years 
the category non traditional principally consists of ticket sales and sponsorships of events our stations and magazines conduct in their local markets 
the category other includes  among other items  revenues generated by the websites of our entities  and barter 
year ended february  of total of total of total net revenues local national political publication sales non traditional lma fees other total net revenues a significant portion of our expenses varies in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our costs that do not vary as much in relation to revenue are mostly in our programming and general and administrative departments  such as talent costs  syndicated programming fees  utilities  office expenses and salaries 
lastly  our costs that are highly discretionary are costs in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience and market share 
known trends and uncertainties although advertising revenues have stabilized following the recent global recession  radio revenue growth remains challenged 
management believes this is principally the result of two factors the proliferation of advertising inventory caused by the emergence of new media  such as various media distributed via the internet  telecommunication companies and cable interconnects  as well as social networks and social coupon sites  all of which are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media and the perception of investors and advertisers that satellite radio and portable media players diminish the effectiveness of radio advertising 

table of contents the company and the radio industry have begun several initiatives to address these issues 
the radio industry is working aggressively to increase the number of portable digital media devices that contain an fm tuner  including smartphones and music players 
in many countries  fm tuners are common features in portable digital media devices 
the radio industry is working with leading united states network providers  device manufacturers  regulators and legislators to ensure that fm tuners are included in future portable digital media devices 
including fm as a feature on these devices has the potential to increase radio listening and improve perception of the radio industry while offering network providers the benefits of a proven emergency notification system  reduced network congestion from audio streaming services  and a host of new revenue generating applications 
emmis is at the leading edge of this initiative and has developed tagstation  a cloud based software platform that allows a broadcaster to manage album art  meta data and enhanced advertising on its various broadcasts  and nextradio  a hybrid radio smartphone application  as an industry solution to make the user experience of listening to free over the air radio broadcasts on their enabled smartphones a rich experience 
the company has also aggressively worked to harness the power of broadband and mobile media distribution in the development of emerging business opportunities by becoming one of the fifteen largest streaming audio providers in the united states  developing highly interactive websites with content that engages our listeners  using sms texting and delivering real time traffic to navigation devices 
along with the rest of the radio industry  the majority of our stations have deployed hd radio 
hd radio offers listeners advantages over standard analog broadcasts  including improved sound quality and additional digital channels 
to make the rollout of hd radio more efficient  a consortium of broadcasters representing a majority of the radio stations in nearly all of our markets have agreed to work together in each radio market to ensure the most diverse consumer offering possible and to accelerate the rollout of hd radio receivers  particularly in automobiles 
in addition to offering secondary channels  the hd radio spectrum allows broadcasters to transmit other forms of data 
we are participating in a joint venture with other broadcasters to provide the bandwidth that a third party uses to transmit location based data to hand held and in car navigation devices 
it is unclear what impact hd radio will have on the markets in which we operate 
the results of our radio operations are heavily dependent on the results of our stations in the new york and los angeles markets 
these markets account for nearly of our radio net revenues 
during fiscal  both kpwr fm in los angeles and wqht fm in new york experienced revenue growth that was better than their overall markets 
our results in new york and los angeles are often more volatile than our larger competitors due to our lack of scale in these markets 
relative to our competitors  we are overly dependent on the performance of one station in each of these markets  and as the competitive environment shifts  our ability to adapt is limited 
furthermore  some of our competitors that operate larger station clusters in new york and los angeles are able to leverage their market share to extract a greater percentage of available advertising revenue through discounting unit rates and may be able to realize operating efficiencies by programming multiple stations in these markets 
as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 
however  emmis operating company s the company s principal operating subsidiary  hereinafter eoc credit agreement substantially limits our ability to make acquisitions 
we also regularly review our portfolio of assets and may opportunistically dispose of assets when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of various dispositions that occurred during the three years ended february critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that encompass significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially derive materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
revenue recognition broadcasting revenue is recognized as advertisements are aired 
publication revenue is recognized in the month of delivery of the publication 
both broadcasting revenue and publication revenue recognition is subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time the advertisement is aired for broadcasting revenue and upon delivery of the publication for publication revenue 
advertising revenues presented in the financial statements are reflected on a net basis  after the deduction of advertising agency fees  usually at a rate of of gross revenues 

table of contents fcc licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to fcc licenses and goodwill assets 
as of february   we have recorded approximately million in goodwill and fcc licenses  which represents approximately of our total assets 
in the case of our radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our fcc licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective periods  and we expect that all fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
we consider our fcc licenses to be indefinite lived intangibles 
we do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets  but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
when evaluating our radio broadcasting licenses for impairment  the testing is performed at the unit of accounting level as determined by accounting standards codification asc topic in our case  radio stations in a geographic market cluster are considered a single unit of accounting  provided that they are not being operated under a local marketing agreement by another broadcaster 
we complete our annual impairment tests on december of each year and perform additional interim impairment testing whenever triggering events suggest such testing is warranted 
valuation of indefinite lived broadcasting licenses fair value of our fcc licenses is estimated to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
to determine the fair value of our fcc licenses  the company uses an income valuation method when it performs its impairment tests 
under this method  the company projects cash flows that would be generated by each of its units of accounting assuming the unit of accounting was commencing operations in its respective market at the beginning of the valuation period 
this cash flow stream is discounted to arrive at a value for the fcc license 
the company assumes the competitive situation that exists in each market remains unchanged  with the exception that its unit of accounting commenced operations at the beginning of the valuation period 
in doing so  the company extracts the value of going concern and any other assets acquired  and strictly values the fcc license 
major assumptions involved in this analysis include market revenue  market revenue growth rates  unit of accounting audience share  unit of accounting revenue share and discount rate 
each of these assumptions may change in the future based upon changes in general economic conditions  audience behavior  consummated transactions  and numerous other variables that may be beyond our control 
the projections incorporated into our license valuations take current economic conditions into consideration 
assumptions incorporated into the annual impairment testing as of december  were similar to those used in our december  annual impairment testing 
below are some of the key assumptions used in our annual and interim impairment assessments 
the methodology used to value our fcc licenses has not changed in the three year period ended february  december  december  december  discount rate long term revenue growth rate mature market share operating profit margin in connection with the lma of fm in new york previously discussed  the company separated its two new york stations into separate units of accounting 
the company performed an interim impairment test of those licenses during the quarter ended may   and recorded an interim impairment charge of million 
no further impairment of our fcc licenses was recorded as a result of our december  annual test 
valuation of goodwill asc topic requires the company to test goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step process 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of impairment 
the company conducts the two step impairment test on december of each fiscal year  unless indications of impairment exist during an interim period 
when assessing its goodwill for impairment  the company uses an enterprise valuation approach to determine the fair value of each of the company s 
table of contents reporting units radio stations grouped by market and magazines on an individual basis 
management determines enterprise value for each of its reporting units by multiplying the two year average station operating income generated by each reporting unit current year based on actual results and the next year based on budgeted results by an estimated market multiple 
the company uses a blended station operating income trading multiple of publicly traded radio operators as a benchmark for the multiple it applies to its radio reporting units 
there are no publicly traded publishing companies that are focused predominantly on city and regional magazines as is our publishing segment 
therefore  the market multiple used as a benchmark for our publishing reporting units is based on recently completed transactions within the city and regional magazine industry or analyst reports that include valuations of magazine divisions within publicly traded media conglomerates 
for the annual assessment performed as of december   the company applied a market multiple of times and to times the reporting unit s operating performance for our radio and publishing reporting units  respectively 
management believes this methodology for valuing radio and publishing properties is a common approach and believes that the multiples used in the valuation are reasonable given our peer comparisons and market transactions 
to corroborate the step one reporting unit fair values determined using the market approach described above  management also uses an income approach  which is a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
this enterprise valuation is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit for the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
if the reporting unit exhibits impairment  the company proceeds to the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
for its step two testing  the enterprise value is allocated among the tangible assets  indefinite lived intangible assets fcc licenses valued using a direct method valuation approach and unrecognized intangible assets  such as customer lists  with the residual amount representing the implied fair value of the goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the difference is recorded as an impairment charge in the statement of operations 
the methodology used to value our goodwill has not changed in the three year period ended february  during our december  annual goodwill impairment test  the company wrote off million of goodwill associated with our indianapolis monthly publication 
declining operating performance of indianapolis monthly resulted in a step one indication of impairment for indianapolis monthly on both the market and income approaches 
upon completing the step two analysis  the company determined that the full carrying amount of indianapolis monthly goodwill of million was impaired 
sensitivity analysis based on the results of our december  annual impairment assessment  the fair value of our broadcasting licenses was approximately million which was in excess of the million carrying value by million  or 
the fair values exceeded the carrying values of all of our units of accounting 
should our estimates or assumptions worsen  or should negative events or circumstances occur in the units that have limited fair value cushion  additional license impairments may be needed 
radio broadcasting licenses as of unit of accounting december  carrying value december  fair value percentage by which fair value exceeds carrying value wqht fm new york fm new york austin cluster st 
louis cluster indianapolis cluster kpwr fm los angeles terre haute cluster total our annual impairment testing on december  resulted in a million impairment charge related to goodwill of our indianapolis monthly publication 
if we were to assume a basis points change in any of our three key assumptions a reduction in the long term revenue growth rate  a reduction in local commercial share or an increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our broadcasting licenses on december   the resulting impairment charge would have been million  million and million  respectively 
also  if we were to assume a market multiple decrease of one or a decrease in the two year average station operating income  two of the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our goodwill on december   the resulting 
table of contents estimates of enterprise valuations would still exceed the carrying values of the enterprises 
as such  step two of the goodwill impairment testing would not be required  thus no goodwill impairment would be recognized if these two key assumptions were lowered 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
income taxes are recognized during the year in which the underlying transactions are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities as recorded for financial reporting purposes and amounts recorded for income tax purposes 
after determining the total amount of deferred tax assets  the company determines whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if the company determines that a deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized  a valuation allowance will be established against that asset to record it at its expected realizable value 
insurance claims and loss reserves the company is self insured for most healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
the company had million and million accrued for employee healthcare claims as of february  and  respectively 
the company also maintains large deductible programs ranging from thousand to thousand per occurrence for workers compensation  employment liability  automotive liability and media liability claims 
acquisitions  dispositions and investments the transactions described below impact the comparability of operating results for the three years ended february  sale of slovakia radio operations on february   emmis completed the sale of its slovakian radio network to bauer ausland gmbh for million in cash 
emmis believed the sale of its international radio properties would better enable the company to focus its efforts on its domestic radio stations 
the sale of our bulgarian radio network on january  created a one time tax benefit that we could use if we sold the slovakian network on or before february  in connection with the sale  emmis recorded a gain on sale of assets of approximately million  which is included in income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
finalization of the transaction is subject to further working capital adjustments 
sale of bulgarian radio operations on january   emmis completed the sale of its bulgarian radio network to reflex media eeod for million in cash 
emmis believed the sale of its international radio properties would better enable the company to focus its efforts on its domestic radio stations 
in connection with the sale  emmis recorded a loss on sale of assets of approximately million  which is included in income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the loss on disposal primarily resulted from the reclassification of accumulated currency translation adjustments 
sale of emmis interactive inc on october   emmis completed the sale of emmis interactive inc  a subsidiary of emmis that provided a content management system  data analytic tools and related services  to marketron broadcast solutions  llc marketron for no net proceeds 
the sale of emmis interactive inc allowed emmis to mitigate expected future operating losses and focus its efforts on its domestic radio operations and other promising technology initiatives 
marketron had assumed operating control of emmis interactive  inc  on october  in connection with the sale  emmis recorded a loss on sale of assets of approximately million  which is primarily related to severance for former employees and is included in income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents sale of sampler publications on october   emmis completed the sale of country sampler magazine  smart retailer magazine  and related publications altogether the sampler publications and certain real estate used in their operations to subsidiaries of drg holdings  llc 
emmis believed the sale of the sampler publications  which were niche crafting publications  would enable it to more clearly focus on its core city and regional publications 
emmis received gross proceeds from the sale of million  incurred approximately million in transaction expenses and tax obligations  and used the remaining million to repay term loans under the company s credit agreement 
in connection with the sale  emmis recorded a gain on sale of assets of approximately million  which is included in income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations sale of kxos fm on august   emmis completed the sale of kxos fm in los angeles for million in cash 
in connection with the sale  emmis recorded a gain on sale of assets of approximately million  which is included in income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
kxos fm had previously been operating pursuant to a local programming and marketing agreement  which is discussed in more detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sale of controlling interest in wrxp fm  wkqx fm and wlup fm on september   the company completed the sale of a controlling interest in merlin media  llc merlin media  which owned the following radio stations i wkqx fm  mhz  channel  chicago  il fin  ii wrxp fm  mhz  channel  new york  ny fin and iii wlup fm  mhz  channel  chicago  il fin collectively the merlin stations 
the company received gross cash sale proceeds of million in the transaction  and incurred approximately million of expenses  principally consisting of severance  state and local taxes  and professional and other fees and expenses 
the company used the net cash proceeds to repay approximately of the term loans then outstanding under its credit facility 
emmis also paid a million exit fee to canyon related to the repayment of extended term loans on september  on september   subsidiaries of emmis entered into the nd amended restated limited liability company agreement the llc agreement of merlin media  together with merlin holdings  llc merlin holdings  an affiliate of investment funds managed by gtcr  llc  and benjamin l 
homel aka randy michaels together with merlin holdings  the investors 
in connection with the completion of the disposition of assets to merlin media and sale of a controlling interest in merlin media pursuant to the purchase agreement dated june  among the company  merlin holdings and mr 
homel the purchase agreement  the company retained preferred equity and common equity interests in merlin media  the terms of which are governed by the llc agreement 
the company s common equity interests in merlin media represented of the initial outstanding common equity interests of merlin media and are subject to dilution if the company fails to participate pro rata in future capital calls 
the fair value of the company s common equity ownership of merlin media llc as of september  was approximately million  and accounted for under the equity method 
the company s preferred equity interests in merlin media consist of approximately million at par of non redeemable perpetual preferred interests  on which a preferred return accretes quarterly at a rate of per annum 
the fair value of this preferred equity interest as of september   was approximately million and is accounted for under the cost method 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion of our investments in merlin media 
the preferred interests held by the company are junior to initial non redeemable perpetual preferred interests held by the investors of approximately million  on which a preferred return accretes quarterly at a rate of per annum 
the preferred interests held by the company and the investors are both junior to an initial million senior secured note issued to an affiliate of merlin holdings 
the note matures five years from closing  and interest accrues on the note semi annually at a rate of per annum  payable in cash or in kind at merlin media s election 
distributions in respect of merlin media s common and preferred interests are made when declared by merlin media s board of managers 
given the company s continued equity interests in the stations  it is precluded from reclassifying the operating results of the stations to discontinued operations 
upon deconsolidation  emmis recorded the retained common and preferred equity interests at fair value 
the fair value of our investments in merlin media llc was calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model s inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument in a current period transaction based upon estimated future cash flows and other estimates at september  inputs to the model include stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the derivatives and risk free interest rates 
results from the valuation model in one period may not be indicative of future period measurements 
merlin media changed the format of wkqx fm in chicago and wrxp fm in new york from a music intensive format to a news talk format 
both stations incurred substantial start up losses well in excess of the original business model used in the september  
table of contents valuation 
both stations underperformed through february   so much so that station cash flows were expected to be substantially lower than the estimated cash flows used in the september  valuation of our retained common and preferred equity interests 
as such  emmis reassessed the fair value of the retained common and preferred equity interests using the same valuation methodology described above with updated assumptions  and determined that our equity interests were fully impaired 
the company believes that the magnitude of the impairment and the potentially prolonged recovery period indicate that the impairment is other than temporary 
as such  emmis wrote off the remaining carrying value of its investments in merlin media llc 
the total equity method loss and other than temporary impairment loss recognized related to merlin media llc of million is recognized in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended february   merlin media sold wrxp fm in new york to a third party and changed the format of wkqx fm in chicago to a music intensive format 
under the llc agreement  the company is entitled initially to appoint one out of five members of merlin media s board of managers and has limited consent rights with respect to specified transactions 
the company has no obligation to make ongoing capital contributions to merlin media  but as noted above is subject to dilution if it fails to participate pro rata in future capital calls 
as of february   due to our nonparticipation in capital contributions to merlin media  our common equity ownership interest is approximately 
merlin media is a private company and the company will have limited ability to sell its interests in merlin media  except pursuant to customary tag along rights with respect to sales by merlin media s controlling investor or  after five years  in a private sale to third parties subject to rights of first offer held by the controlling investor 
the company has customary registration rights and is subject to a drag along right of the controlling investor 
on september   the compensation committee of the company s board of directors approved a discretionary bonus of million to certain employees that were key participants in the merlin media transaction 
the discretionary bonus is reflected in corporate expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended february  sale of glendale  ca tower site on april   emmis sold land  towers and other equipment at its glendale  ca tower site to richland towers management flint  inc for million in cash 
in connection with the sale  emmis recorded a gain on sale of assets of approximately million 
net proceeds from the sale were used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
results of operations year ended february  compared to year ended february  net revenues for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands net revenues radio publishing total net revenues radio net revenues decreased principally due to the july  commencement of an lma related to the merlin stations and the ultimate sale of a controlling interest in these stations on september  during the time these stations were operated pursuant to the lma  emmis recorded  as net revenue  a million monthly lma fee  but did not record advertising sales during this period 
given the company s continued equity interests in the stations  it is precluded from reclassifying the operating results of the stations to discontinued operations 
also  the operating results for fm formerly known as wrks fm in new york as an adult urban station through april  and the lma fee revenue recognized since april  have not been classified as discontinued operations 
excluding the merlin stations and fm for both periods presented  radio net revenues would have increased million or 
we typically monitor the performance of our stations against the aggregate performance of the markets in which we operate based on reports for the periods prepared by miller kaplan 
miller kaplan reports are generally prepared on a gross revenues basis and 
table of contents exclude revenues from barter arrangements 
a summary of market revenue performance and emmis revenue performance in those markets for the year ended february  is presented below for the year ended february  overall market emmis market revenue performance revenue performance new york los angeles st 
louis indianapolis austin all markets publishing net revenues were flat for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  during the year ended february   the publishing division made an effort to increase the percentage of its advertising sales settled in cash and reduce the amount settled in barter 
in prior periods  the level of barter activity was significantly higher than the level of barter activity during fiscal excluding barter revenue  publishing net revenues for the year ended february  would have increased approximately million or 
station operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands station operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense radio publishing total station operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense radio station operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  decreased principally due to the lma and eventual sale of the merlin stations as previously discussed as well as our lma of fm in new york 
in connection with the lma of fm in april  emmis operating expenses related to that station were reduced dramatically 
excluding the merlin stations and fm  radio station operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense would have increased million or 
this increase is due to continued targeted investments in sales training and enhancements in our digital capabilities  coupled with higher operating expenses associated with wqht fm in new york as shared costs that had previously been spread across three stations in new york are now borne by wqht fm 
publishing operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  increased predominately due to increases in advertising expenses 
emmis revenue performance in new york reflects only wqht fm and los angeles reflects only kpwr fm 
table of contents corporate expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands corporate expenses excluding depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended february   corporate expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  included the following non recurring items i approximately million of indirect costs associated with the preferred stock transactions discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  ii approximately million of costs associated with the rd amendment to the company s credit agreement discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  iii a million bonus paid to certain employees in connection with the sale of the merlin stations and iv a million discretionary bonus paid to substantially all corporate employees during the quarter ended august  during the year ended february   corporate expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  included million of costs incurred related to preferred stock litigation  a million discretionary bonus paid to substantially all corporate employees and million related to the forgiveness of a loan to our ceo in connection with his december employment agreement 
these increases were partially offset by a favorable resolution of an accrued expense  resulting in a million reduction to corporate expenses 
hungary license litigation expense for the year ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands hungary license litigation expense on october   the hungarian national radio and television board ortt announced that it was awarding to another bidder the national radio license then held by our majority owned subsidiary  slager 
slager ceased broadcasting effective november  the company believes that the awarding of the license to the other bidder was unlawful 
in october  emmis filed for arbitration with the international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid seeking resolution of its claim 
the increase in slager litigation expense and related costs during the year ended february  is due to additional rd party legal costs incurred by emmis in the prosecution of its claim 
impairment loss on intangible assets for the year ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands impairment loss on intangible assets   n a in connection with our april lma of fm in new york and in accordance with the company s accounting policy  the company decoupled its two new york fcc licenses into separate units of accounting 
the company performed an interim impairment test of the fm in new york given its carrying value exceeded the fair value of a single new york fcc license as of our december impairment test 
the company recorded an million impairment loss in connection with the interim review 
in connection with our annual impairment review conducted on december   the company determined that the goodwill of its indianapolis monthly publication was fully impaired and recorded a million loss 
absent further changes in the company s determination of units of accounting due to the execution of an lma or a significant change in the company s assumptions used in determining the fair value of its fcc licenses  the company believes that continued 
table of contents growth of radio revenues makes it unlikely that further impairment losses will be recorded related to its fcc licenses 
furthermore  barring a significant change in the company s assumptions used in determining the fair value of its goodwill  the operating performance of our entities with recorded goodwill makes it unlikely that material amounts of goodwill will be written off in future periods 
accordingly  we do not expect historical operating results to be indicative of future operating results 
depreciation and amortization for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands depreciation and amortization radio publishing corporate total depreciation and amortization the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for our radio segment is mostly attributable to the sale of a controlling interest in the merlin stations on september  the increase in corporate depreciation and amortization is mostly due to the implementation of a new customer management system that was internally developed

operating income for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands operating income radio publishing corporate total operating income most of the change in operating income is related to the effect of the sale of a controlling interest in the merlin media stations and the lma of fm 
as previously discussed  the operations of the merlin media stations remain in continuing operations given the company s retained investment in the stations 
the operating loss for these stations during fiscal was approximately million 
also contributing to the increase in operating income was the fm lma in new york 
in connection with the lma  the company s

the impairment losses recorded during the year ended february  are mostly negated by the gain on sale of wrks fm s intellectual property 
interest expense for the years ended february  change change as reported  amounts in thousands interest expense although we repaid a significant amount of long term debt during the year ended february   interest expense increased due to interest incurred on the senior unsecured notes which were issued late in fiscal and exit fees paid on our extended term loans during fiscal the company refinanced its debt on december  and expects that interest expense for fiscal will be materially lower than prior periods

smulyan participates that do not constitute a change of control transaction  to cause the holders of the preferred stock to no longer have such ability  changed the ability of the holders of the preferred stock to convert all of such preferred stock to class a common stock upon a change of control at specified conversion prices to cause the holders of the preferred stock to no longer have such ability  changed the ability of holders of the preferred stock to vote as a separate class on a plan of merger  share exchange  sale of assets or similar transaction to the ability to vote with the common stock on an as converted basis except as may otherwise be required by law  and changed the conversion price adjustment applicable to certain merger  reclassification and other transactions to provide that the preferred stock converts into the right to receive property that would have been receivable had such preferred stock been converted into class a common stock immediately prior to such transaction 
as a result of the elimination of the rights of holders of preferred stock to require emmis to repurchase all of such holders preferred stock in certain going private transactions  the preferred stock was reclassified from temporary equity to permanent equity

as of may   we had million available for additional borrowing under our credit facility 
availability under the credit facility depends upon our continued compliance with certain operating covenants and financial ratios 
emmis was in compliance with these covenants as of february  as part of our business strategy  we continually evaluate potential acquisitions of radio stations  publishing properties and other businesses that we believe hold promise for long term appreciation in value and leverage our strengths 
however  emmis operating company s credit facility substantially limits our ability to make acquisitions 
we also regularly review our portfolio of assets and may opportunistically dispose of assets when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of various dispositions that occurred during the three years ended february intangibles as of february   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as fcc broadcast licenses  goodwill  and trademarks  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations for compliance with regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our fcc licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all of our fcc licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements  other than presentation and disclosure 
seasonality our results of operations are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations  which result in higher second and third quarter revenues and operating income 
for our radio operations  this seasonality is due to the younger demographic composition of many of our stations 
advertisers increase spending during the summer months to target these listeners 
in addition  advertisers generally increase spending across all segments during the months of october and november  which are part of our third quarter  in anticipation of the holiday season 
inflation the impact of inflation on operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect on operating results  particularly since a significant portion of our senior bank debt is comprised of variable rate debt 
off balance sheet financings and liabilities other than interest rate swap agreements  which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and lease commitments  legal contingencies incurred in the normal course of business  contractual commitments to purchase goods and services and employment contracts for key employees  all of which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not have any material off balance sheet financings or liabilities
