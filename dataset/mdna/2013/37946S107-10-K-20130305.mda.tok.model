item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial information section of this form k and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  which are incorporated herein by reference 
overview we provide an integrated suite of seismic data solutions to the global oil and gas industry  including our high resolution rgd seismic solutions 
our seismic data solutions consist primarily of seismic data acquisition  microseismic monitoring  data processing and interpretation services 
through these services  we deliver data that enables the creation of high resolution images of the earth s subsurface and reveals complex structural and stratigraphic details 
these images are used primarily by oil and gas companies to identify geologic structures favorable to the accumulation of hydrocarbons  to reduce risk associated with oil and gas exploration  to optimize well completion techniques and to monitor changes in hydrocarbon reservoirs 
we integrate seismic survey design  data acquisition  processing and interpretation to deliver enhanced services to our clients 
in addition  we own and market a growing seismic data library and license this data to clients on a non exclusive basis 
we provide seismic data acquisition for land  transition zone and shallow marine areas  including challenging environments such as marshes  forests  jungles  arctic climates  mountains and deserts worldwide 
our management team has significant operational experience in most of the major us shale and tight reservoir plays  including the haynesville  barnett  bakken  fayetteville  eagle ford and woodford  where we believe our high resolution rgd seismic solutions are particularly well suited 
our seismic solutions are used by many of the world s largest and most technically advanced oil and gas exploration and production companies  including national oil companies nocs  major integrated oil companies iocs  and large independent oil and gas companies 
we provide seismic data acquisition on a worldwide basis for land  transition zone and shallow marine areas  including challenging environments such as marshes  forests  jungles  arctic climates  mountains and deserts 
we also have significant operational experience in most of the major us shale plays  including the haynesville  barnett  bakken  fayetteville  eagle ford and woodford  and tight reservoir plays 
we believe this experience positions us well to serve our customers as they expand their involvement in these plays outside the us as of december   we owned approximately  recording channels 
our recording channels and systems are interoperable providing operational scalability and efficiency  enabling us to execute on large and technologically complex projects 
we generate revenues primarily by providing proprietary services and multi client services to our clients 
our proprietary services generate revenues by conducting geophysical surveys for our clients on a contractual basis where our clients generally acquire all rights to the seismic data obtained through such survey 
we also generate revenues by providing microseismic monitoring  data processing and interpretation services 
our multi client services generate revenues by selling licenses  on a non exclusive basis  to data we own as a part of our seismic data library 

table of contents key accomplishments we have grown at a rapid pace since commercial operations began in may  finishing with million in revenues 
during this period  we continued to expand not only our operational capabilities but also our service offerings to include land  transition zone and shallow marine seismic data acquisition  processing and interpretation services and multi client services 
other recent highlights include operating income for the year ended december  was of revenues  compared to for the same period of net book value of the multi client library was million at december  compared to million at december  increasing our seismic data library to approximately  square miles as of december  compared with approximately  square miles as of december  the following table summarizes gross margin by segment in thousands year ended december  proprietary services multi client services corporate total revenues operating expenses gross margin sg a operating income gross margin year ended december  revenues operating expenses gross margin sg a operating income gross margin corporate operating expenses represent gain loss on sale of assets

multi client services revenues represented and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
proprietary services 
we generate revenues by conducting geophysical surveys for our clients on a contractual basis where our clients generally acquire all rights to the seismic data obtained through such survey 
we also generate revenues by providing microseismic monitoring  data processing and interpretation services on a similar basis 
most of our proprietary services  microseismic monitoring  data processing and interpretation services business is obtained through competitive bidding 
we generally require approximately days of preparation and diligence in order to prepare and submit a bid in response to a request for proposal 
in certain circumstances  various factors  such as the difficulty of the terrain involved or remoteness of the survey area  may require considerably more time to prepare and submit a bid 
our clients usually ask us to quote a turnkey rate for each completed unit of recorded data  or less frequently  they may ask for a term rate bid 
when we perform work on a turnkey basis a defined amount and scope of work is provided by us for a fixed price and extra work  which is subject to client approval  is billed separately  whereas when we perform work on a term rate basis  one of our seismic crews is hired for a fixed fee per day 
current market conditions drive our portfolio of outstanding contracts in terms of pricing turnkey  term rate or a combination of the two 
we also enter into contracts that combine different pricing elements  such as a term rate contract with bonus incentives for early completion or achievement of certain performance metrics to maximize the economic incentives for both us and our client 
we have entered into master service agreements with many of our clients 
these agreements specify payment terms  establish standards of performance and allocate certain operational risks through indemnity and related provisions and are supplemented on a project by project basis with pricing terms and other project specific terms 
revenues from our proprietary services segment are recognized when they are realizable and earned as services are performed based on the proportionate performance method 
we defer unearned revenues until earned  and recognize losses in full when they occur 
our contracts typically provide that we remain responsible for the majority of costs and expenses associated with a particular project 
we seek to manage the risk of delays through the inclusion of standby rate provisions 
these provisions are included in most of our contracts and require payment to us of a reduced rate for a limited amount of time if we are unable to record seismic data as a result of weather conditions or certain other factors outside our control 
the pricing for any proprietary services  microseismic monitoring  data processing or interpretation services project is primarily determined by the data quality requirement  resolution  program parameters  complexity and conditions including the timing  location and terrain and equipment required to complete the project 
multi client services 
we generate multi client revenues by granting a license to seismic data 
this allows our clients to have access to seismic data at a cost that is generally less than acquiring data on a proprietary basis 
our multi client services differ from our proprietary services projects in that we set the specifications of the program  generally handle all aspects of the seismic data acquisition and maintain ownership of the seismic data and its corresponding revenue stream 
the seismic data sets that we have acquired through our multi client services are included in our seismic data library 
revenues under our arrangements are generated as pre commitments  late sales and or data swaps  or a combination thereof  from the licensing of multi client data 
the terms of the license typically set pricing on a per square mile basis  specify a defined survey area  and include limitations on transferability of the underlying data 
we retain ownership of the seismic data acquired and licensed in multi client services which remains available for late sales 
historically  we achieved pre commitments levels of of our cash investment in the portfolio 
for programs commencing in  we began to target pre commitment levels of or greater to further reduce our risk exposure in new multi client services projects 
we may receive additional cash amounts as certain project milestones are reached 
the cash inflows from these pre commitments generally correspond to the timing of our cash expenses on a project 

table of contents the following table summarizes data for our multi client services in millions year ended december  multi client services revenues cash investment in multi client library assets capitalized depreciation non cash data exchange total investment in multi client library assets year ended december  cumulative total investment in multi client library assets less accumulated amortization of multi client library assets multi client net book value at period end represents capitalized cost of the equipment owned or leased under capital leases and utilized in connection with a multi client seismic shoot 
how we evaluate our operations we evaluate our land  transition zone and shallow marine projects on a project basis and as a whole using similar performance metrics 
in addition  our management utilizes a variety of financial and productivity metrics to analyze and monitor our performance 
these metrics include  but are not limited to  the following safety performance rates  miles or kilometers of acquired data  ebitda  cash flow from operations  cash flow after investments  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of revenues  our ebit in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenues  and the level of pre commitment funding and late sales for our multi client projects 

table of contents the information generated using the foregoing metrics is an important part of our operational analysis 
we apply these metrics to monitor operations separately for each of our projects and analyze trends to determine the relative performance of each 
we seek to have strong centralized financial analysis and controls to allocate our crews  combined with local decision making and flexibility in the delivery of services to maximize client satisfaction 
recent trends affecting our business the seismic data services industry historically has been cyclical 
volatility in oil and gas prices can produce significant changes in the demand for seismic services and the prices seismic contractors can negotiate for their services 
oil and gas exploration  development  exploitation and production spending levels traditionally have been heavily influenced by expected future prices of oil and natural gas 
in connection with increases in crude price levels  there have been planned increases in capital expenditures by oil and gas companies throughout the world 
we expect the increases in capital expenditure spending to result in increased demand for seismic services 
the seismic industry is transitioning from legacy cabled recording systems to autonomous nodal technologies 
we have benefited from this transition through improved operating efficiency and expanded seismic offerings 
we are also observing the continued emergence of microseismic recording technologies and services 
we expect to utilize our capabilities and technologies to provide offerings for this emerging field 
financial operations overview revenues 
a portion of our revenues are generated from either large projects or multiple projects from a limited number of clients 
as a result  a small number of clients typically represent a significant amount of our revenues in any particular period 
for the year ended december   we had one client which represented more than of our revenues 
because we work on different projects for various clients on a regular basis  it is not uncommon for our top clients to change from year to year 
the table below presents the concentration of revenues among our clients representing or more of our revenues for the years ended december   and year ended december  of total revenues largest client second largest client third largest client top three clients less than presented for comparison purposes in this table 
revenues generated from our international operations are primarily attributable to providing proprietary services 
the percentage of revenues that we derive from international operations has increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we believe the international seismic data services market continues to provide significant growth opportunities in the markets we choose to serve 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are primarily a function of our seismic data recording crew count  make up and utilization levels on a project by project basis 
our productivity depends largely on the equipment utilized  seismic survey design  operating efficiency and external factors such as weather and third party delays 
our seismic data acquisition services are performed outdoors and are therefore subject to seasonality 
shorter winter days  competing uses of land and adverse weather negatively affects our ability to provide services in certain regions 
in order to minimize the effect of seasonality on our assets  we have diversified our operations in a manner such that our equipment is mobile between regions and countries and our common platform of equipment also works to improve crew productivity by allowing us to move equipment and people between crews as needed with minimal compatibility issues 
certain costs  such as equipment rentals and leases  depreciation  certain labor  some repair and maintenance  and interest payments  are fixed and are incurred regardless of utilization  and account for a significant percentage of our costs and expenses 
accordingly  downtime or low productivity resulting from weather interruptions  reduced demand  equipment failures or other causes can result in significant operating losses

taxes 
our effective tax rate has varied widely  and has trended significantly higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of for a number of reasons  including us foreign tax credit limitations  state income tax liabilities  the disallowance of certain per diem payments and other expenses for tax purposes  and valuation allowances provided for losses and foreign tax credits related to our international operations 
in addition  as a result of our operations in various foreign jurisdictions  we are subject to a number of different tax regimes that have significantly affected our effective tax rates in some cases 
for example  in some countries we are subject to a withholding tax on our revenues regardless of our profits 
we expect that our overall effective tax rate in future periods will generally trend higher than the us federal statutory rate 
in late  the company restructured some foreign entities for tax purposes 
however  we cannot assure you that our effective tax rate will decline 
we could experience significantly higher effective rates in different periods as a result of the factors described above 
gross profit margin 
our gross profit margins for the years ended december   and  were  and  respectively 
the gross profit margin increase in as compared to is attributable to the decrease in operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of increased gains on sale of assets and decreased multi client amortization expense 
backlog 
our backlog consists of contracted seismic data acquisition and multi client unrecognized pre commitments 
our estimated backlog as of december  was approximately million as compared to million as of december  backlog estimates are based on a number of assumptions and estimates including assumptions related to foreign exchange rates  and proportionate performance of contracts and our valuation of assets  such as seismic data  to be received by us as payment under certain agreements the realization of our backlog estimates are further affected by our performance under term rate contracts  as the early or late completion of a project under term rate contracts will generally result in decreased or increased  as the case may be  revenues derived from these projects 
contracts for services are occasionally modified by mutual consent and may be cancelable by the client under the circumstances described in business narrative description of business service contracts 
consequently  backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual operating results for any future period 
see risk factors our backlog estimates are based on certain assumptions and are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and thus may not be timely converted to revenues in any particular fiscal period  if at all  or be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  such as backlog 
we continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determining our financial condition and operating results 
estimates are based upon information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 

table of contents revenue recognition proprietary services 
our proprietary services are provided under cancelable service contracts  which vary in terms and conditions 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the terms of the contract 
these contracts are turnkey or term agreements or a combination of the two 
under turnkey agreements or the turnkey portions thereof  we recognize revenues based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as square miles or linear kilometers of data acquired 
under term agreements or the term portions thereof  period revenues are recognized on a day rate basis 
under certain contracts where the client pays separately for the mobilization of equipment to the project site  we recognize these mobilization fees as revenues during the performance of the seismic acquisition  using the same quantifiable measures of progress as for the acquisition work 
we also receive reimbursements for certain other out of pocket expenses under the terms of our service contracts 
we record amounts billed to clients in revenues as the gross amount including out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by the client 
in some instances  customers are billed in advance of services performed which we record as deferred revenue 
multi client services 
revenues are recorded under our arrangements from the licensing of our multi client data as pre commitments  late sales and or data swap transactions 
once a contract is signed  it is either classified as a pre commitment  or a late sale and the entire contract will follow revenue recognition as described below 
revenues from the creation of our multi client projects are recognized when i we have a licensing arrangement with the customer that is validated by a signed contract  ii the sales price is fixed and determinable  iii collection is reasonably assured  and iv delivery  as defined in the paragraph below  has occurred 
when the above criteria have been satisfied  we recognize revenues using the proportionate performance method based upon quantifiable measures of progress such as square mile or linear kilometer of data acquired 
revenues associated from a data swap transaction are recognized when i we have an arrangement with the customer that is validated by a signed contract  ii the value is determined based on the value which is more readily determinable between the two data sets  and iii the asset exchanged for has been received 
delivery is defined as data is made available to the customer to view 
if the data is subject to any incremental processing  we hold back a portion of the revenues to be recognized upon the delivery of the processed data to the customer 
this hold back is calculated as a percentage of the data processing cost remaining to complete over the entire cost of the project 
pre commitment revenues 
pre commitments represent one classification of revenues 
pre commitment revenues are contractual obligations whereby a client commits funds in advance of our acquisition of seismic data 
in return for these pre commitments  our clients typically have some input with respect to project specifications and receive preferential pricing 
we record pre commitment payments as deferred revenue when they are received and record them as revenues on the basis of proportionate performance 
late sale revenues 
late sales represent another classification of multi client revenues 
for any contract  if all or any portion of the data has been acquired by the company and it can be made available to view by the customer  it will be classified as a late sale 
for late sale contracts  any portion associated with data which has not been acquired will be deferred and recognized as revenues on the basis of proportionate performance 
we establish amortization rates based on the estimated future revenues both from pre commitments and late sales on an individual survey basis 
the underlying estimates that form the basis for the sales forecast depend on historical and recent revenue trends  oil and gas prospects in particular regions  current and future expectations about commodity prices for oil and gas  general economic conditions affecting our customer base  expected changes in technology and other factors 
the estimation of future cash flows and fair value is highly subjective and inherently imprecise 
estimates can change materially from period to period based on many factors  including those described in the preceding paragraph 
accordingly  if conditions change in the future  an impairment loss may be recorded relative to the seismic data library  which could be material to any particular reporting period 
however  under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a four year straight line amortized value 
this is accomplished by comparing the cumulative amortization recorded for each survey to the cumulative straight line amortization 
if the cumulative straight line amortization is higher for any specific survey  additional amortization expense is recorded  resulting in accumulated amortization being equal to the cumulative straight line amortization for such survey 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable billed and unbilled based on our past experience of historical write offs  our current client base and our review of past due accounts 
however  the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of our clients 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and our multi client data library if facts and circumstances indicate that any of those assets might be impaired 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such property and multi client data library is necessary 
the effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such property and its carrying value 
for the multi client data library  the impairment evaluation is based first on a comparison of the undiscounted future cash flows over each project s remaining estimated useful life with the carrying value of each project 
if the undiscounted cash flows are equal to or greater than the carrying value of such project  no impairment is recorded 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of any project  the forecast of future cash flows related to such project is discounted to fair value and compared with such project s carrying amount 
the difference between the project s carrying amount and the discounted future value of the expected revenue stream is recorded as an impairment charge 
there were no impairment charges recognized in our statements of operations during the years ended december   and depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment 
our property  plant and equipment are capitalized at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
our estimation of the useful life of a particular asset is based on circumstances that exist in the seismic industry and information available to our management at the time of the purchase of the asset 
the technology of the equipment used to gather data in the seismic industry has historically evolved such that obsolescence does not occur quickly 
as circumstances change and new information becomes available these estimates could change 
we amortize these capitalized items using the straight line method 
capital assets are depreciated over one to ten years depending on the classification of the asset 
tax accounting 
the company follows asc income taxes 
under the asset and liability method required by this guidance  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a deferred tax asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance when  based on the company s estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period 
the realization of our deferred tax assets depends on recognition of sufficient future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions during periods in which those temporary differences are deductible 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts the company believes are more likely than not to be recovered 
in evaluating our valuation allowance  the company considers the reversal of existing temporary differences  the existence of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies and future taxable income for each of our taxable jurisdictions  the latter two of which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
changes to our valuation allowance have significantly impacted current year results of operations and could significantly impact future results of operations 
we have liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions connected with ongoing examinations and open tax years 
changes in our assessment of these liabilities may require us to increase the liability and record additional tax expense or reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit which would negatively or positively  respectively  impact our effective tax rate 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance asc compensation stock compensation  which requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
in so doing  we use the black scholes merton option pricing model  which requires various assumptions as to interest rates  volatility  dividend yields and expected lives of stock based awards

table of contents ebitda 
we define ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indication of operating performance

our management team believes ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because this measure is widely used by investors in the energy industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon  among other factors  accounting methods  book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
we believe ebitda helps investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure and asset base from our operating structure 
ebitda is also used as a supplemental financial measure by our management in presentations to our board of directors  as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting  and as a component for setting incentive compensation

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated by the proprietary services and multi client services we provide to our clients  debt and equity offerings  our revolving credit facility  and equipment financings such as capital leases 
our primary uses of capital include the acquisition of seismic data recording equipment  seismic vehicles and vessels  other equipment needed to outfit new crews and to enhance the capabilities of and maintain existing crews energy sources  and investments in multi client services data for our library 
we also use capital to fund the working capital required to launch new crews and operate existing crews 
our cash position  consistent with our revenues  depends to a large extent on the level of demand for our services

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s in the normal course of operations  we are exposed to market risks primarily from credit risk  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk  consist primarily of unsecured trade receivables 
in the normal course of business  we provide credit terms to our customers 
accordingly  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for possible losses which  when realized  have been within the range of our expectations 
we believe that our unreserved trade receivables at december   are collectible and our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 
we generally provide services to a relatively small group of key customers that account for a significant percentage of our accounts receivable at any given time 
our key customers vary over time 
we extend credit to various companies in the oil and natural gas industry  including our key customers  for the acquisition of seismic data  which results in a concentration of credit risk 
this concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in the economic or other conditions of our key customers and may accordingly impact our overall credit risk 
our cash bank balance may exceed federally insured limits 
interest rate risk fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable debt obligations expose us to market risk 
we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates affecting our adjustable rate debt  and any future refinancing of our fixed rate debt and our future debt 
at december   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our credit facilities carrying variable interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in many foreign countries 
we are subject to foreign exchange risks because our contracts may  from time to time  be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar while a significant portion of our operating expenses and income taxes accrue in other currencies 
movements in the exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may adversely affect our financial results 
historically  we have not attempted to hedge foreign exchange risk 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were recorded in foreign currencies  and we recorded net foreign exchange loss of million 
we attempt to match our foreign currency revenues and expenses in order to balance our net position of receivables and payables in foreign currency 
nevertheless  during the past three years  foreign denominated revenues have exceeded foreign denominated payables primarily as a result of contract terms required by our national oil company clients 
our management believes that this will continue to be the case in the future 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our business  financial condition  or results of operations during the most recent three years
