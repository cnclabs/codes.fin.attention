neogen corporation management does not provide forecasts of future financial performance 
while management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial results 
any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  seeks  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors  including competition  recruitment and dependence on key employees  impact of weather on agriculture and food production  identification and integration of acquisitions  research and development risks  patent and trade secret protection  government regulation and other risks detailed from time to time in the company s reports on file at the securities and exchange commission  that could cause neogen corporation s results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements  including those detailed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in addition  any forward looking statements represent management s views only as of the day this report on form k was first filed with the securities and exchange commission and should not be relied upon as representing management s views as of any subsequent date 
while management may elect to update forward looking statements at some point in the future  it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so  even if its views change 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates  including but not limited to those related to receivable allowances  inventories and intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies reflect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from products and services is recognized when a purchase order has been received  the product has been shipped or the service performed  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection of any receivable is probable 
to the extent customer payment is received before all recognition criteria has been met  these revenues are initially deferred and later recognized in the period that all recognition criteria has been met 
where right of return exists  allowances are made at the time of sale to reflect expected returns based on historical experience 
accounts receivable allowance management attempts to minimize credit risk by reviewing customers credit history before extending credit and by monitoring credit exposure on a regular basis 
an allowance for possible losses on accounts receivable is established based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
collateral or other security is generally not required for accounts receivable 
once a receivable balance has been determined to be uncollectible  that amount is written off to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory has been established and is reviewed at least quarterly based on an analysis of the inventory taking into account the current condition of the asset as well as other known facts and future plans 
the amount of reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted as conditions change 
product obsolescence may be caused by shelf life expiration  discontinuance of a product line  replacement products in the marketplace or other competitive situations 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses after amounts are allocated to other identifiable intangible assets 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  trademarks  licenses  trade names  covenants not to compete and patents 
amortizable intangible assets are amortized on either an accelerated or a straight line basis over five to years 
the company reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets annually  or when indications of impairment exist  to determine if such assets may be impaired 
if the company s qualitative assessment concludes that it is probable that an impairment exists  or the company skips the qualitative assessment  then the company performs a quantitative assessment 
if the carrying amounts of these assets are deemed to be less than fair value based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and comparison to comparable ebitda multiples of peer companies  such assets are reduced to their estimated fair value and a charge is made to operations 

table of contents long lived assets management reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used  including definite lived intangible assets  for possible impairment whenever events or changes in business conditions warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
in such an event  fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and if lower than the carrying value  impairment is recognized through a charge to operations 
equity compensation plans asc compensation stock compensation addresses the accounting for share based employee compensation 
further information on the company s equity compensation plans  including inputs used to determine fair value of options is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
asc requires that share options awarded to employees and shares of stock awarded to employees under certain stock purchase plans be recognized as compensation expense based on their fair value at grant date 
the fair market value of options granted under the company s stock option plans was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for inputs such as interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and specific employee exercise behavior patterns based on statistical data 
some of the inputs used are not market observable and have to be estimated or derived from available data 
use of different estimates would produce different option values  which in turn would result in higher or lower compensation expense recognized 
to value options  several recognized valuation models exist 
none of these models can be singled out as being the best or most correct one 
the model applied by the company is able to handle some of the specific features included in the options granted  which is the reason for its use 
if a different model were used  the option values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using a different valuation model could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options 
fair value could be either higher or lower than the ones produced by the model applied and the inputs used

consolidated gross margins increased from in to in  due primarily to shifts in product mix within the company s animal safety segment  and to a lesser extent  a higher proportion of overall sales growth derived from the food safety segment  which has higher than average gross margins 
margins improved in the animal safety segment as the result of higher sales of a canine thyroid replacement product  a recovery in rodenticide sales from a weak  and new product revenues from acquisitions  all of which are higher gross margin products within the segment 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased from in to in  as the company continued to make investments in personnel and other infrastructure initiatives  which it believes should lead to increased market penetration and improved operating performance in future periods 
the animal safety segment benefitted from acquisitions in  with revenue from acquisitions totaling million during the year 
the uniprim product line of veterinary antibiotics  acquired from macleod pharmaceuticals in october  helped to improve gross margins within animal safety 
geneseek added to its offerings and capabilities with the igenity acquisition in late fiscal year and the scidera acquisition in january neogen europe recorded a revenue increase of more than in sales were particularly strong in germany  where unusually wet  cool weather during the fall growing season resulted in a mycotoxin outbreak in the small grain crops  growth in the united kingdom was due to increased meat speciation testing in the second half of the year  the result of mislabeled meat products 
neogen europe also achieved significant increases in sales of services to genomics customers in the eu 
neogen latinoamerica and neogen do brasil continued to build out their sales and operations infrastructures  resulting in improved market presence  and recorded revenue gains of more than and  respectively  in over  albeit from relatively small bases

allergen test kit revenues continued to achieve solid growth with an increase of in fiscal compared to fiscal this 
table of contents product line had core growth of this year  and also benefitted from a significant increase in demand for meat speciation testing in europe in the second half of the year  the result of the discovery of mislabeled meat products 
originally  horse meat was found in products labeled as beef  further testing also found instances of pork and other meat products in beef  as well as tilapia being sold as whitefish 
these are all examples of economic adulteration of food  which has become quite problematic within the food safety industry  and should result in higher ongoing levels of speciation testing in the future 
also in this category  sales of drug residues products  primarily used to determine the presence of antibiotics in raw fluid milk from dairy animals  increased compared to the prior year 
sales of bacterial and general sanitation products increased in  compared with within this category  general sanitation products  designed to measure environmental cleanliness  achieved growth of  increased sales of filters and ampoule media products  the result of increased penetration in the beverage segment  more than offset lower equipment sales to international markets

rodenticide and disinfectant revenues increased by compared to rodenticide sales increased due to seasonal conditions  new product formulations  marketing campaigns  and a prior year which was negatively affected by epa labeling changes 
almost entirely offsetting this increase was an decrease in lower margin sales of cleaners and disinfectants 
the decrease was primarily due to competition from lower priced generics  particularly internationally  lack of disease outbreak for most of the year  which led to lower demand  and timing of large international orders 
veterinary instruments and other revenues increased in fy compared to fy within this category  the company benefitted from sales of the veterinary antibiotic  uniprim  acquired in the macleod pharmaceuticals purchase  and a increase in the small animal supplements line due to new business captured on canine thyroid replacement products 
partially offsetting these gains were a decrease in vitamin supplements  due to unusually high prior year sales caused by products coming off backorder and a decline in the number of cattle  and a decrease in hoof and leg care products  due to lower animal counts and difficult financial conditions in the dairy industry

the increase in cost of goods sold  expressed as a percentage of sales  in compared to was also due to product mix within the animal safety segment 
food safety gross margins were  and in  and  respectively 
the minor changes in margins between periods relate primarily to changes in product mix 
food safety segment sales were of overall sales in compared to in both and the sales shift towards diagnostic products  which have higher margins  contributed to the company s overall gross margin improvement in animal safety gross margins were  and in  and  respectively 
the improvement in the margins from to was due to a shift in product mix resulting from higher sales of small animal supplements  rodenticides and the new uniprim product line acquired from macleod pharmaceuticals 
additionally  geneseek benefitted from higher margins due to new service offerings acquired in the igenity and scidera genomics purchases 
the change in the margins from to was primarily due to product mix  as a decline in rodenticide revenues  which generally have a higher gross margin  were offset by increases in cleaners and disinfectants  which are a lower margin product 

table of contents operating expenses dollars in thousands increase decrease increase decrease sales and marketing general and administrative research and development sales and marketing expenses increased by in and by in  each compared with the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sales and marketing expense increased to in from in and from in the and increases were primarily the result of the significant investment in sales and marketing personnel which the company announced and undertook beginning in late since  positions have been added  an increase of  consisting of additional field sales  marketing  and technical service personnel 
this investment was designed to improve the company s sales and marketing capabilities  increase market penetration and facilitate the company s domestic and international expansion opportunities 
other significant expense increases were for royalties  based on increased sales of products which require royalty payments  shipping expenses  corresponding to the increase in revenues  higher advertising costs and marketing promotions 
general and administrative expenses increased in compared to and by in compared to the increase in resulted primarily from increased salaries due to increases in personnel  investments in information technology infrastructure necessary to support the growth of the company  increased amortization relating to businesses acquired and legal expenses related to the protection of the company s intellectual property 
research and development expenses increased in compared to and decreased by in in comparison with as a percentage of revenue these expenses were in  and although some fluctuation in research and development expenses will occur across periods  management expects research and development expenses to approximate to of revenues 
certain company products  particularly on the animal safety side of the business  require relatively less investment in research and development expenses 
for those products requiring support by research and development  the company estimates that it spends to of revenues in its research and development efforts 
the increase in is the result of the significant costs resulting from the testing and commercialization of the new products introduced during the year 
operating income dollars in thousands increase decrease increase decrease operating income during fiscal year  the company s operating income increased by compared to and decreased in by when compared to as a percentage of revenues it was  and in  and respectively 
the increase in operating income in was driven by the increase in revenues which  when combined with the improved gross margins  more than offset the increased operating expenses 
the decline in operating income in was due primarily to the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  which more than offset the higher gross margins resulting from increased revenue 
in general  the company has been successful in improving its operating income from revenue and gross margin growth from existing products and acquisitions and through control of manufacturing  distribution and administrative costs 
in each of the last two fiscal years  the company s operating expenses have risen  on a percentage basis  faster than the increase in revenues 
this is the result of the investment the company has been making in its sales  marketing and operations infrastructure  to position the company for future growth opportunities

in december  neogen europe purchased oswald hall  a  square foot building in ayr  scotland  for approximately  to accommodate its future growth needs 
the company completed construction of a warehouse in randolph  wisconsin in early it also purchased a  square foot warehouse facility in lexington  kentucky in august for million 
these facilities are generally believed to be adequate to support the company s existing operations in the near term 
neogen has been profitable from operations for its last quarters and has generated positive cash flow from operations during this period 
however  the company s cash on hand and current borrowing availability may not be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements to commercialize products currently under development or its plans to acquire additional businesses  technology and products that fit within the company s strategic plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company has interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure and no long term fixed rate investments or borrowings 
the company s primary interest rate risk is due to potential fluctuations of interest rates for variable rate borrowings and short term investments 
because neogen markets and sells its products throughout the world  it could be affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce the demand for its products 
sales in certain foreign countries as well as certain expenses related to those sales are transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound and the euro 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
neogen has assets  liabilities and operations outside of the united states that are located primarily in ayr  scotland where the functional currency is the british pound sterling 
to a lesser extent it also has assets  liabilities and operations in mexico where the functional currency is the mexican peso and in brazil where the functional currency is the real 
the company s investment in its foreign subsidiaries is considered long term  accordingly  it does not hedge the net investment nor does it generally engage in other foreign currency hedging activities 
it does  however  use strategies to reduce the exposure to currency fluctuations related to payables and receivables
