the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains certain forward looking information 
see special note regarding forward looking statements above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements 
our financial statements are prepared in us dollars and in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in the research  development  manufacturing and sales of human plasma based pharmaceutical products in china 
we have two majority owned subsidiaries  shandong taibang  a company based in tai an  shandong province and guizhou taibang  a company based in guiyang  guizhou province 
we also hold a minority equity interest in huitian  a company based in xi an  shaanxi province 
the human plasma based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in china is highly regulated by both provincial and central governments 
accordingly  the manufacturing process of our products is strictly monitored from the initial collection of plasma from human donors to finished products 
our principal products are human albumin and immunoglobulin products 
albumin has been used for almost years to treat critically ill patients by replacing lost fluid and maintaining adequate blood volume and pressure 
immunoglobulin is used for certain disease prevention and treatment by enhancing specific immunity 
these products use human plasma as the principal raw material 
human albumin and human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection  or ivig products  are our top selling products 
sales of human albumin products represented approximately  and of our total sales for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales of ivig products represented approximately  and of our total sales for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
all of our products are prescription medicines administered in the form of injections 
we sell our products primarily to hospitals and inoculation centers in the prc directly or through approved distributors 
we usually sign short term contracts with customers and therefore our largest customers have changed over the years 
for the years ended december   and  our top customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total sales 
as we continue to diversify our geographic presence  customer base and product mix  we expect that our largest customers will continue to change from year to year 
we operate and manage our business as a single segment 
we do not account for the results of our operations on a geographic or other basis 
recent development in june  we received the manufacturing approval certificate from sfda for fviii 
in october  we obtained the gmp certification for our production facility of fviii from sfda and commenced the commercial production of fviii shortly thereafter 
fviii is widely used in the treatment of hemophilia a 
in an announcement published in september the adjustment  ndrc adjusted retail price ceilings for oncology  immunology and hematology drug products  which came into effect on october  two of our approved products  ivig and fviii are affected by the adjustment 
the new retail price ceilings for ivig products are lower than the current prevailing market prices in some of our regional markets while those for fviii are close to the current prevailing market prices 
as a result  some of local governments revised tender price ceilings for ivig products 
we have appealed to local governments for favorable pricing policy in selective regional markets and have successfully gained support from guizhou and shandong provincial governments in lifting the tender price ceilings for ivig products 
in january  ndrc further adjusted retail price ceilings for certain drug products  which came into effect on february  the adjustment 
three of our approved products  human albumin  human rabies immunoglobulin and human tetanus immunoglobulin are affected by the adjustment 
the adjustment slightly increased retail price ceilings for both human albumin and human tetanus immunoglobulin products and subject human rabies immunoglobulin products to a retail price ceiling for the first time 
the retail price ceiling imposed on human rabies immunoglobulin products by the adjustment is close to the prevailing market retail price 
in january  shandong taibang obtained the approval from relevant prc authorities to establish a wholly owned subsidiary  cao xian plasma company  to operate a plasma collection station in shandong province 
we expect to obtain the operating permits and commence plasma collection by the end of june the new gmp standard  which has significantly increased standards for quality control  documentation  and overall manufacturing processes  will become applicable to all of our production facilities by the end of year we had planned to construct a new production facility for guizhou taibang at a new site to meet the new gmp standard 
however  due to delays in government approval procedures with respect to the land use rights  the construction of the new production facility may not be completed as planned 
in order to minimize operation disruption  we plan to upgrade the current production facility at guizhou taibang to meet the new gmp standard 
such upgrade is expected to commence in june or july and complete in six to nine months 
guizhou taibang s production will be suspended during this process 
to mitigate the negative impact of production suspension of guizhou taibang on our business operation  we have been increasing inventory level in the past few quarters  adjusted product shipment plans for and have been and will continue to increase production volume during the first half of we will also work closely with local authorities to speed up the approval procedures of the land use rights for the new manufacturing facility to ensure the production expansion in the long run 
see item a risk factors risk related to our business one of our production facilities will suspend production for technical upgrade in order to meet the new gmp standard  which may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and result of operations 
financial performance highlights the following are some financial highlights for the fiscal year ended december  sales sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased by to for from for income from operations income from operations increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  net income attributable to company net income attributable to company increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  fully diluted net income per share fully diluted net income per share was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  principal factors affecting our financial performance the following are key factors that affect our financial condition and results of operations and we believe them to be important to the understanding of our business raw material supply and prices the primary raw material used in the production of our albumin and immunoglobulin products is human plasma 
the collection of human plasma in china is generally influenced by a number of factors such as government regulations  geographical locations of plasma collection stations  sanitary conditions of plasma stations  living standards of the donors  and cultural and religious beliefs 
if we experience any shortage of plasma supply  we may not be able to fully utilize our production capacity 
as of december   we operate nine plasma collection stations through shandong taibang and two plasma stations through guizhou taibang 
these plasma stations provide us with a stable source of plasma supply 
due to current market conditions  we have generally been able to pass substantially all cost increases in recent years on to our customers 
prices of and demand for our products the demand for our products is largely affected by the general economic conditions in china because the prices of our products are still not affordable to many patients 
a significant improvement in the economic environment in china will likely improve consumer income which in turn would make our products more affordable and consequently increase the demand for our products 
we have been able to expand our product range and consumer base by introducing new products required by customers 
we believe that our technical expertise is important in introducing products that are in demand 
production capacity our sales volume is limited by our annual production capacity 
as we grow our business in the future  our ability to fulfill additional and larger orders will depend on our ability to increase our production capacity 
our plan to expand our production capacity will depend on  inter alia  the availability of capital to meet our needs of expansion or upgrading of production lines  and the availability of stable plasma supply 
as of december   the aggregate production capacity of shandong taibang and guizhou taibang was  metric tons per annum 
we estimate that the production capacity of our major competitors ranges from tons to  tons per annum 
due to the upgrade of the current production facility starting june or july as mentioned above  our production at guizhou taibang will be suspended for six to nine months 
as a result  we expect our total production capacity to decrease in and competition we are subject to intense competition 
there are both local and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of potential substitute or similar biopharmaceutical products as our products in the prc 
these competitors may have more capital  better research and development resources  manufacturing and marketing capability and experience than we do 
in our industry  we compete based upon product quality  product cost  ability to produce a diverse range of products and logistical capabilities 
we believe that we have a strong position in the marketplace with our majority owned operating subsidiary  shandong taibang  majority owned operating subsidiary  guizhou taibang  and equity interest in huitian 
our profitability may be adversely affected if i competition intensifies  ii competitors drastically reduce prices  iii prc government s interference on prices of our products  or iv competitors develop new products or product substitutes with comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects which are more effective or less costly than those produced by us 
please refer to item  business competition for more information regarding this factor 
taxation china biologic is subject to united states tax at a tax rate of 
no provision for income taxes in the united states has been made as china biologic has no taxable income 
taibang biological was incorporated in the bvi  but is not subject to taxation in that jurisdiction

results of operations the following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the periods indicated 
our historical results presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other future period

in addition  foreign exchange translation accounted for of the sales increase 
the following table summarizes the breakdown of sales by significant types of product for the years ended december  change in change amount in human albumin   immunoglobulin products human hepatitis b immunoglobulin   ivig    other immunoglobulin products   placenta polypeptide   others    totals    all of our approved plasma based products recorded price increases ranging from approximately to  except for human hepatitis b immunoglobulin products  which decreased by approximately 
for as compared to  the average price for our approved human albumin products  which contributed to our total sales  increased by approximately and  excluding the foreign exchange translation effect  their average price in rmb term increased by approximately  the average price for our approved ivig products  which contributed to our total sales  increased by approximately  and excluding the foreign exchange translation effect  their average price in rmb term increased by approximately 
the general price increase of our human albumin products and immunoglobulin products other than human hepatitis b immunoglobulin products was primarily attributable to the shortage in supply of such products in as a result of the closure of several plasma collection stations in guizhou in the price decrease of human hepatitis b immunoglobulin products was mainly due to the government program sponsored by prc ministry of health with respect to these products in late the sales prices of participating products in this program are generally lower than normal retail prices for public interest purposes 
the sales volumes of our products in general depend on market demands and our production volumes 
the production volumes of our ivig and human albumin products depend primarily on general plasma supply 
the production volumes of our hyper immune products  which include human rabies immunoglobulin  human hepatitis b immunoglobulin and human tetanus immunoglobulin products  are subject to the availabilities of the specific vaccinated plasma and our production capacity 
the supply of vaccinated plasma in general requires several months of lead time 
each of our production facility currently can only accommodate the production of one type of hyper immune products at any given time and we rotate the production of different types of hyper immune products from time to time in response to market demand 
as such  the sales volume of any given type of hyper immune products may vary significantly from period to period 
sales volume for our human albumin products decreased by in as compared to the decrease in sales volumes of human albumin products was primarily due to the decrease of its production volumes caused by the reduced raw material supply as a result of the closure of several plasma collection stations in guizhou 
sales volume for our ivig products increased by in as compared to the increase in sales volumes of ivig products was primarily due to the increased market demand in and our increased inventory level in the later part of in anticipation of such demand increase 
the market demand for ivig products increased due to its wide utilization for the prevention and treatment of more diseases in  which is in line with the medical practice in europe and the united states 
sales of placenta polypeptide products increased substantially in as compared to we began manufacturing and selling placenta polypeptide products in december prior to december  we provided processing service for guizhou eakan co  ltd 
eakan  an affiliate of one of guizhou taibang s non controlling interest holders  for placenta polypeptide products 
the revenue we derived from the sales of placenta polypeptide products is substantially higher than the processing fees we used to charge for these products 
cost of sales gross profit for the years ended december  change amount cost of sales    as a percentage of total sales gross profit    gross margin our total cost of sales was  or of our sales  for the year ended december   as compared to  or of our sales for the year ended december  our gross profit was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing gross margins of and  respectively 
in general  our cost of sales and gross margin are impacted by the volume and pricing of our finished products  our raw material costs  production mix and respective yields  inventory provisions  production cycles and routine maintenance costs 
the increase in cost of sales was largely in line with the increase of sales 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales and the decrease of gross margin were mainly due to the increase in cost of plasma paid to donors  which is the largest component of our cost of sales 
in an effort to increase plasma collection volume and expand our donor base  we increased the nutrition fees paid to donors in as compared to  which was in line with the industry practice 
we expected the nutrition fees paid to donors continue to increase as a result of improving living standards and the increasing trend of urbanization in china 
consequently  future improvements on margins will need to be derived from increases in product pricing and volumes  product mix  yields and manufacturing efficiency 
recent ndrc announcement on retail price ceiling of our products limits the opportunities for us to increase product selling price 
as such  the combination of the factors mentioned above will most likely result in lower gross margins in future periods 
operating expenses for the years ended december  change amount operating expenses    as a percentage of total sales our total operating expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  we incurred an impairment loss of  in  including both goodwill impairment and abandonment of long lived assets as a result of the closure of several plasma collection stations in guizhou in august no impairment loss was recorded for the year ended december  as a percentage of total sales  total expenses decreased by to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  selling expenses for the years ended december  change amount selling expenses    as a percentage of total sales for the year ended december   our selling expenses decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of total sales  our selling expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  to  from for the year ended december  we took initiative to further control the selling expenses for the year ended december  the aforementioned factors contributed to the decrease in selling expenses as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  change amount general and administrative expenses   as a percentage of total sales for the year ended december   our general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  from  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales decreased by to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in expenses related to payroll and employee benefits as a result of general salary increases and an increase in legal expenses relating to the disputes among guizhou taibang shareholders 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to improvement of cost efficiency as a result of the economies of the scale 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  change amount research and development expenses    as a percentage of total sales for the years ended december  and  our research and development expenses were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
as a percentage of total sales  our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to the completion of the r d tests on fviii in early impairment loss of goodwill for the years ended december  change amount impairment loss of goodwill   as a percentage of total sales following the closure of plasma collection stations of guizhou taibang due to the regulatory notice  we revised our earnings guidance for the year of and experienced incremental decline in our stock price and market capitalization in the third quarter of the occurrence of these events caused us to believe that the fair value of our reporting unit would more likely than not be below its book value 
therefore  we performed a two step goodwill impairment test and concluded that  for the year ended december   a goodwill impairment loss of  was recognized in our single reporting unit since the carrying amount of the reporting unit was greater than the fair value of the reporting unit as determined based on the quoted market price and the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
no impairment of goodwill has been recorded in the year ended december  loss on abandonment and write off of long lived assets for the years ended december  change amount loss on abandonment and write off of long lived assets  as a percentage of total sales as a result of the closure of the plasma stations of guizhou taibang  certain equipment  office furniture  building improvement and plasma collection permits were abandoned or written off during the third quarter of loss on abandonment of guizhou taibang s long lived assets of  was recognized for the year ended december  no loss on abandonment was recorded in the year ended december change in fair value of derivative liabilities for the years ended december  change amount change in fair value of derivative liabilities  as a percentage of total sales our warrants issued in june are classified as derivative liabilities carried at fair value 
for the year ended december   we recognized a gain of  from the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities  as compared to a gain of  for the year ended december  the gain from the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities in was mainly due to a decrease in the price of our common stock from per share as of december  to per share upon the exercise of the warrants on june  all warrants have been exercised by the end of interest expense for the years ended december  change amount interest expense    as a percentage of total sales our interest expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the decrease of the average loan balances for as compared to interest income for the years ended december  change amount interest income    as a percentage of total sales our interest income increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income is primarily due to our investment in certain short term financial products with higher interest rates as well as the increase in our total cash deposit

comparison of fiscal years ended december  and sales our total sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in sales during was primarily attributable to a mix of price and volume increases in certain of our plasma based products 
in addition  foreign exchange translation accounted for of the sales increase

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap  requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements  including the following use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of fixed assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the fair value determinations of financial and equity instruments and the valuation of share based compensation  assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  deferred tax assets and inventories  the recoverability of goodwill  intangible asset  land use right and property  plant and equipment  and reserves for income tax uncertainties and other contingencies 
the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition revenue represents the invoiced value of products sold  net of value added taxes vat 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the relevant receivable is probable 
the company mainly sells human albumin and human immunoglobulin to hospitals  inoculation centers and pharmaceutical distributors 
for all sales  the company requires a signed contract or purchase order which specify pricing  quantity and product specifications 
delivery of the product occurs when customer receives the product  which is when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
delivery is evidenced by signed customer acknowledgement 
the company s sales agreements do not provide the customer the right of return  unless the product is defective in which case the company allows for an exchange of product or return 
for the periods presented  defective product returns were immaterial 
fair value measurements we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible 
we determine fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market 
when considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs  which are categorized in one of the following levels level inputs unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets accessible to the entity at the measurement date 
level inputs other than quoted prices included in level  inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available  thereby allowing for situations in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date 
the fair value measurement level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the fair values of the warrants that were exercised on june and june   and outstanding as of december  were determined based on the binominal option pricing model  using the following key assumptions june  june  december  expected dividend yield risk free interest rate time to maturity in years expected volatility fair value of underlying common shares per share accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
amounts collected on trade accounts receivable are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio 
in establishing the required allowance  management considers historical losses  the customers financial condition  the amount of accounts receivable in dispute  the accounts receivable aging and customers payment patterns 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
we generally ask our distributors to pay in advance before we deliver products  with few exceptions for a credit period of no longer than days 
for hospitals and clinics  depending on the relationship and the creditability  we generally grant a credit period of no longer than days with exceptions to customers that we believe are credit worthy up to months 
due to recovery of bad debt that we previously provided an allowance  the decrease in valuation allowance of bad debt was   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
cost of work in progress and finished goods comprise direct materials  direct production costs and an allocation of production overheads based on normal operating capacity 
adjustments are recorded to write down the carrying amount of any obsolete and excess inventory to its estimated net realizable value based on historical and forecasted demand 
we review the inventory periodically for possible obsolete goods and cost in excess of net realizable value to determine if any reserves are necessary 
for the year ended december  and  we wrote off  and  relating to obsolete plasma that may not qualify for production due to the day quarantine period rules implemented by sfda 
share based payment we measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which generally is the vesting period 
the fair value of options granted for the year ended december   and are estimated on the respective dates of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following major assumptions for the years ended december  december  december  expected volatility expected dividends yield expected term in years risk free interest rate fair value of underlying common stock per share the volatility of our common stock was estimated by us based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate was based on treasury constant maturity rates published by the us federal reserve for periods applicable to the estimated term of the options 
the expected dividend yield was based on our current and expected dividend policy 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangible asset subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if circumstances require a long lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment  we first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values and third party independent appraisals  as considered necessary 
we recognized a loss on abandonment and write off of long lived assets totaling  for the year ended december  as described in note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are carried out in the prc and we are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in north america and western europe 
accordingly  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political  economic and legal environments in the prc  and by the general state of the prc economy 
our results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations  anti inflationary measures  currency conversion and remittance abroad  and rates and methods of taxation  among other things 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short term bank loans 
although interest rates of our short term loans are fixed for the terms of the loans  the terms are typically three to twelve months for short term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal 
there were no material changes in interest rates for short term bank loans renewed during the year ended december a hypothetical increase in the annual interest rates for all of our credit facilities under which we had outstanding borrowings as of december  would decrease net income before provision for income taxes by approximately  for the year ended december  management monitors the banks prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign exchange risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and majority of expenses are denominated in rmb 
all of our assets are denominated in rmb  except certain cash balances 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and rmb 
if rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income  a component of stockholder s equity 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the value of the rmb against the us dollar and other currencies is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
since july  the rmb has not been pegged to the us dollar 
although the people s bank of china regularly involved in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar or euro in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in rmb exchange rate and lessen involvement in the foreign exchange market 
account balances we maintain balances at financial institutions which  from time to time  may exceed federal deposit insurance corporation insured limits for the banks located in the united states or may exceed hong kong deposit protection board insured limits for the banks located in hong kong 
balances at financial institutions or state owned banks within the prc are not covered by insurance 
total cash in banks as of december  and december  amounted to  and  respectively   and  of which are covered by insurance  respectively 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and we do not believe that we are exposed to any significant risks on our cash in bank accounts 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our sales and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
market for human albumin and ivig our two major products  human albumin and ivig  accounted for and of the total sales for the year ended december   respectively 
if the market demands for human albumin or ivig cannot be sustained in the future or if there is substantial price decrease in either or both products  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected
