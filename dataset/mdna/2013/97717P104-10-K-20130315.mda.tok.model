executive summary we were the seventh largest sponsor of etfs in the united states based on aum  with aum of approximately billion as of december  an etf is an investment fund that holds securities such as equities or bonds and or other assets such as derivatives or commodities and that generally trades at approximately the same price as the net asset value of its underlying components over the course of the trading day 
etfs offer exposure to a wide variety of investment themes  including domestic  international and global equities  fixed income securities  currencies or commodities  as well as securities in specific industries and countries 
at december  we offered a comprehensive family of etfs  which includes international and domestic equity etfs  five currency etfs  five international fixed income etfs and two alternative strategy etfs 
through our operating subsidiary  we provide investment advisory and other management services to the wisdomtree etfs 
in exchange for providing these services  we receive advisory fee revenues based on a percentage of the etfs average daily net assets under management 
our expenses are predominantly related to selling  operating and marketing our etfs 
we have contracted with third parties to provide certain operational services for the etfs 
we distribute our etfs through all major channels within the asset management industry  including brokerage firms  registered investment advisors  institutional investors  private wealth managers and discount brokers 
we do not target our etfs for sale directly to the retail segment but rather to financial or investment advisor which act as intermediaries between the end client and us 
our revenues have increased substantially since we launched our etfs in june our revenues have grown from million in to a record million in and our financial results have improved from a net loss of million in to net income of million in market environment we have been and continue to operate in an extremely challenging and highly competitive business environment 
since the financial crises in and  equity markets have generally improved  however  the markets continue to experience significant volatility due to a host of factors including underlying concerns regarding unemployment and the rate of economic recovery in the united states  the stability of european economies and their banks  and rising inflation and sustainability of growth in the emerging market countries 
since the end of to the end of  the s p  msci eafe and msci emerging markets indexes increased  and  respectively  however equity markets have fluctuated significantly during that time period 
the following chart reflects the returns for the three broad based equity market indexes and our aum logo investment into the markets have been tepid since the financial crisis as reflected by the flows into long term mutual funds and etfs as indicated on the chart below logo despite the tepid flows  etfs flows experienced a record billion in net inflows 
in fact  over the last five years  etfs have gathered more than of the cumulative aggregate inflows of long term mutual funds and etfs 
logo while both mutual funds and etfs have experienced inflows into fixed income products over the last years  long term mutual funds have experienced significant outflows of billion in equity products 
etfs  on the other hand  have experienced inflows of billion in equity products 
logo we believe this trend in equity flows is indicative that investors are favoring etfs  rather than mutual funds  to obtain their equity exposure 
our results and other business highlights despite a challenging economic environment  our aum has been growing and reaching record levels each year from billion at the end of to billion at the end of our net inflows have also been increasing during that same time period from billion to billion 
we believe this trend is a result of our strong product offerings in emerging markets  new product launches to further diversify our product offering  as well as a longer track record for the funds we launched in and our growth strategy seeks to increase our market share of etf industry inflows through continued product diversification and execution of our marketing and sales strategies 
the following charts reflect certain key operating statistics of our business for the periods indicated logo logo logo logo logo public offerings in february  we completed a public offering of our common stock at per share 
we sold million shares and certain of our stockholders sold million shares 
proceeds to us  less commissions and other direct selling expenses  were approximately million and were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in november  we completed a second public offering of our common stock where certain of our existing stock holders sold million shares at per share 
we did not sell any stock in the second offering and we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders 
we incurred million in expenses in related to the november offering 
price competition in market capitalization weighted index etfs there has been significant price competition in certain broad based market capitalization weighted index etfs sponsored by charles schwab  vanguard and blackrock s ishares 
we believe one of our key competitive strengths is that our equity etfs are based on our own fundamentally weighted index methodology  not market capitalization weighted indexes provided by third parties such as msci  s p dow jones or ftse 
this key competitive strength is apparent when comparing the after fee performance of our equity etfs against their competitive market capitalization weighted indexes  which do not charge a fee 
using our approach  of the billion invested in our equity etfs were in funds that  since their respective inceptions through december   outperformed their market capitalization weighted or competitive benchmarks 
similarly  of our equity etfs have outperformed their market capitalization weighted or competitive benchmarks over the same period 
that is  even after fees  we believe our fundamentally weighted approach can provide investors with better risk adjusted returns over the long term 
we believe our approach differentiates us from our competitors and helps to shield us from the intense price competition occurring in broad based market capitalization weighted index etfs 
patent litigation on december   research affiliates  llc filed suit against us in the united states district court for the central district of california  alleging that the fundamentally weighted investment methodology we employ infringes three of plaintiff s patents  and seeking both unspecified monetary damages in an amount to be determined and an injunction to prevent further infringement 
on november   research affiliates  llc agreed to withdraw its patent infringement suit against us and we agreed to withdraw our counterclaims and entered into a settlement agreement 
under the settlement  all parties exchanged releases for all existing claims 
the other material terms of the settlement are as follows research affiliates agreed not to sue us for any future claims arising under any current patents held by research affiliates  as well as any future patents relating to fundamentally weighted indexes and strategies that may issue under existing or future patent applications that may be filed by research affiliates within the next eight years  subject to reduction by up to three years if research affiliates is acquired 
the covenant not to sue extends to our service providers and customers in connection with our products and services 
we have agreed not to sue research affiliates for any future claims arising under any current patents held by us  as well as any future patents relating to fundamentally weighted indexes and strategies that may issue under existing or future patent applications that may be filed by us within the next eight years  subject to reduction by up to three years if we are acquired 
the covenant not to sue extends to service providers and customers of research affiliates in connection with research affiliates products and services 
research affiliates and we have agreed that the covenants not to sue do not include a right under each party s patents to copy the other party s methodologies 
research affiliates and we have further agreed that it is not copying if research affiliates introduces an index or strategy that uses at least three fundamental factors to weight its indexes and they are not predominantly dividend or earnings weighted  or we introduce an index or strategy that is weighted by less than three fundamental factors 
the parties also agreed not to challenge the other party s patents or patent applications 
research affiliates agreed to a one time payment of million to us 
we and the other defendants were not required to make any current or future payments to research affiliates 
all other terms of the settlement are confidential and the settlement will not affect the current methodologies and fees for wisdomtree etfs 
our insurance carrier funded a significant majority of the cost of defending this patent infringement lawsuit 
the net amount of expense  taking into account legal defense and other associated costs we paid to defend ourselves less any amounts our insurance carrier reimbursed us and the receipt of a settlement payment from research affiliates  we incurred was million in both and expiration of joint venture with bny mellon in  we entered into a mutual participation agreement with mellon capital and dreyfus  wholly owned by bny mellon  in which we agreed to collaborate in developing currency and fixed income etfs under the wisdomtree trust 
under the agreement  we contributed our expertise in operating the etfs  sales  marketing and research  and bny mellon contributed sub advisory  fund administration and accounting services for these collaborated etfs 
all third party costs and profits and losses are shared equally 
this agreement was to expire in march on october   we agreed to terminate the agreement on december  and entered into a new fee arrangement with bny mellon effective january  under the new arrangement  bny mellon will continue to serve as portfolio manager to these etfs under more traditional sub advisory economic terms  which is expected to result in improved gross margins on these etfs at current asset levels 
etf shareholder proxy solicitation in the second quarter of  we initiated the solicitation of proxies from the wisdomtree etf shareholders to obtain approval for us to continue as investment advisor for the wisdomtree etfs if our largest stockholder  michael steinhardt  who beneficially owned of our common stock prior to the second public offering discussed above under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our results and other business highlights public offerings  were to sell or otherwise transfer shares of our common stock resulting in his beneficial ownership falling below 
the investment company act presumes a change in control of our company if mr 
steinhardt s ownership fell below the threshold  which would trigger an automatic termination of our investment advisory agreements with the wisdomtree trust and require approval of the wisdomtree etf shareholders to continue the agreements 
we also sought approval from the wisdomtree etf shareholders to allow us to change sub advisors in the future without further shareholder approval 
we completed the proxy solicitation and obtained the required approvals in august no further shareholder approval was required when  in november  mr 
steinhardt s ownership fell below in connection with a secondary offering we conducted 
we incurred million in proxy related expenses in nasdaq listing on july   we listed our common stock on the nasdaq global market under symbol wetf 
prior to the listing  our common stock was traded on the pink otc market under the symbol wsdt 
we incurred million in expenses related to this listing in components of revenue etf advisory fees the majority of our revenues are comprised of advisory fees we earn from our etfs 
we earn this revenue based on a percentage of the average daily value of aum 
our average daily value of aum is the average of the daily aggregate aum of our etfs as determined by the then current net asset value as defined under investment company act rule a of such etfs as of the close of business each day 
our fee percentages for individual etfs range from to 
a summary of the average advisory fee we earn and aum as of december  by asset class is as follows average advisory fee aum in billions emerging markets equity etfs us equity etfs international developed equity etfs international fixed income etfs currency etfs alternative strategy etfs total average advisory fee and aum we determine the appropriate advisory fee to charge for our etfs based on the cost of operating each particular etf taking into account the types of securities the etfs will hold  fees third party service providers will charge us for operating the etfs and our competitors fees for similar etfs 
generally  our actively managed etfs  such as our alternative strategy and currency etfs  along with our emerging market etfs  are priced higher than our other index based etfs as the former are more costly to operate 
each of our etfs has a fixed advisory fee 
in order to increase the advisory fee  we would need to obtain the approval from a majority of the etf shareholders which may be difficult or not possible to achieve 
there may also be a significant cost in obtaining such etf shareholder approval 
we do not need etf shareholder approval to lower our advisory fee 
until the end of  the advisory fee charged for our currency etfs and one fixed income etf was subject to a joint venture with mellon capital and dreyfus as discussed above under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our results and other business highlights expiration of joint venture with bny mellon 
we have determined that we are the principal participant for transactions under this collaborative arrangement and as such  the advisory fee above reflects the gross fee under this arrangement see notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our etf advisory fee revenue may fluctuate based on general stock market trends which include market value appreciation or depreciation  currency fluctuations against the us dollar and level of inflows or outflows from our etfs 
in addition  these revenues may fluctuate due to increased competition or a determination by the independent trustees of the wisdomtree etfs to terminate or significantly alter the funds investment management agreements with us 
other income other income includes fees from licensing our indexes to third parties and interest income from investing our corporate cash 
these revenues are immaterial to our financial results and we do not expect them to be material in the near term 
components of expenses our operating expenses consist primarily of costs related to selling  operating and marketing our etfs as well as the infrastructure needed to run our business 
compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits expenses are expensed when incurred and include salaries  incentive compensation  and related benefit costs 
virtually all our employees receive incentive compensation which is based on our operating results as well as their individual performance 
therefore  a portion of this expense will fluctuate with our business results 
in order to attract and retain qualified personnel  we must maintain competitive employee compensation and benefit plans 
in normal circumstances  we expect to experience a general rise in employee compensation and benefit expenses over the long term as we grow  however  the rate of increase should be less than the rate of increase in our revenues 
also included in compensation and benefits are costs related to equity awards granted to our employees 
our executive management and board of directors believe very strongly that equity awards are an important part of our employees overall compensation package and that incentivizing our employees with equity in the company aligns the interest of our employees with that of our stockholders 
we use the fair value method in recording compensation expense for restricted stock and options grants 
under the fair value method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
fair value is determined on the date granted using the black scholes option pricing model for the stock options and is determined by the market value of our common stock for restricted stock awards 
at the end of  we changed our employee equity granting policy 
see factors that may affect our future financial results 
fund management and administration fund management and administration expenses are expensed when incurred and are comprised of costs we pay third party service providers to operate our etfs 
under our advisory agreement with the wisdomtree trust  the trustees have approved us and other third parties to provide essential management and administrative services to the trust and each etf in exchange for an advisory fee 
the costs include portfolio management of our etfs sub advisory  fund accounting and administration  custodial services  accounting and tax services  printing and mailing of stockholder materials  index calculation  distribution fees  legal and compliance services  exchange listing fees  trustee fees and expenses  preparation of regulatory reports and filings  insurance  certain local income taxes  and other administrative services 
of significance  we have contracted with bny mellon to act as sub advisor for of of our etfs and provide portfolio management  fund administration  custody and accounting related services for all the wisdomtree etfs 
the fees we pay bny mellon and other sub advisors have minimums per fund which range from  to  per year depending on the nature of the etf 
in addition  we pay additional fees ranging between and of average daily aum at various breakpoint levels 
the fees we pay for accounting  tax  index calculation and exchange listing are based on the number of etfs we have 
the remaining fees are based on a combination of both assets under management and number of funds  or as incurred 
marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expenses are recorded when incurred and include the following costs advertising and product promotion campaigns that are initiated to promote our existing and new etfs as well as brand awareness  development and maintenance of our website  and creation and preparation of marketing materials 
our discretionary advertising comprises the largest portion of this expense and we expect these costs to increase in the future as we continue to execute our growth strategy and compete against other etf sponsors and new market entrants 
we generally decrease our level of advertising in the third quarter due to a general slowdown of trading activity in the market during the summer months  but we may change that strategy going forward based on our financial results  competitive pressures and market conditions 
in addition  we may incur expenditures in certain periods to attract inflows  the benefit of which may or may not be recognized from increases to our assets under management in future periods 
however  due to the discretionary nature of some of these costs  they can generally be reduced if there were a decline in the markets 
sales and business development sales and business development expenses are recorded when incurred and includes the following costs travel and entertainment or conference related expenses for our sales force  market data services for our research team  sales related software tools  and legal and other advisory fees associated with the development of new funds or business initiatives 
professional and consulting fees professional fees are expensed when incurred and consist of fees we pay to corporate advisors including accountants  tax advisors  legal counsel  investment bankers  human resources or other consultants 
these expenses fluctuate based on our needs or requirements at the time 
certain of these costs are at our discretion and can fluctuate year to year 
also included in professional fees is stock based compensation related to restricted stock or option awards we granted to senior advisers to our board of directors 
under generally accepted accounting principles  these awards are considered variable expenses and are re measured each reporting period with a corresponding impact to stockholders equity 
after november  we will no longer incur this expense 
occupancy  communications and equipment occupancy  communications and equipment expense includes costs for our corporate headquarters in new york city 
our office space lease expires in january and we have begun to search for new office space and as such expect these costs to increase in the future 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results primarily from amortization of leasehold improvements to our office space as well as depreciation on fixed assets we purchase which is depreciated over three or seven years 
we expect this expense to increase in future periods in connection with anticipated leasehold improvements we would make for new office space as discussed above 
third party sharing arrangements included in third party sharing arrangements expense are payments from and reimbursements to us with respect to our joint venture with mellon capital and dreyfus which ended at the end of and payments to third parties to market our etfs 
our joint venture with mellon capital and dreyfus is considered a collaborative arrangement and as such we have determined we were the principal participant for transactions under this collaborative arrangement and as such we recorded these transactions on a gross basis reflecting all of the revenues and third party expenses on our financial statements in accordance with the nature of the revenue or expense 
any net profit loss payments are reflected in the third party sharing arrangement expense line 
other other expenses consist primarily of insurance premiums  general office related expenses  securities license fees for our sales force  public company related expenses  corporate related travel and entertainment and board of director fees  including stock based compensation related to equity awards we granted to our directors 
factors that may impact our future financial results aum  net inflows and revenues our revenues are highly correlated to the level and relative mix of our aum  as well as the fee rate associated with our etfs 
while our aum has increased on an annual basis  we have experienced fluctuations on a quarterly basis due to changes in net inflows and market movement 
a significant portion of our aum is invested in securities issued outside of the united states 
therefore  our aum and our revenues are affected by movements in global capital market levels and the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar against other currencies 
another factor impacting our revenues is the fees associated with our etfs 
our overall average fee rate is affected by the mix of flows into our etfs 
with a significant portion of our aum invested in securities issued outside of the us  favorable market sentiment to emerging markets  currencies and international fixed income is likely to have a positive effect on our overall revenue and conversely unfavorable market sentiment is likely to have a negative impact 
in addition  we currently compete within the etf market against several large etf sponsors  many smaller sponsors  as well as new entrants to the marketplace  and will compete against large asset management companies who have recently launched or announced intentions to launch etf products 
however  it is our belief that our ability to gather inflows into our etfs  coupled with general stock market trends  will have the greatest impact on our business 
expenses strategic growth initiatives we have and will continue to strategically invest in our business in order to continue and accelerate our growth in the fast growing etf industry 
our investment in strategic growth initiatives includes anticipated higher spending on marketing  advertising and sales efforts  and increases to our headcount  in both sales and operational support functions 
we intend to launch additional etfs and may close some etfs in the future  which will impact our fund related costs 
we also intend to invest in technology and other tools to enhance our sales efforts and provide value added content to our clients 
we expect our investment in strategic growth initiatives to range from to million in the components of our strategic growth initiatives may increase or decrease from our planned estimates depending on the nature of the growth initiatives and market conditions 
stock based compensation at the end of  we changed our practice for granting equity awards to our employees 
in the past  we would grant meaningful equity awards when employees were hired that would vest over four years with generally no more awards until this initial awards vested 
going forward  employees will receive an equity award as part of their long term incentive compensation on an annual basis  which is a more typical for maturing companies and companies in the financial services industry 
this change in practice will increase our stock based compensation expense in future periods 
in addition  after november  we will no longer incur variable stock based compensation 
gross margin our current gross margin  which we define as our total revenues less our fund management and administration expenses and less third party sharing arrangements  was approximately for the year ended december  due to the end of our joint venture with bny mellon and our current aum levels and mix  we expect our gross margins to be between and in the near term 
seasonality we believe seasonal fluctuations in the asset management industry are common 
however  since we began our operations  we believe these seasonal trends may have been masked by the unprecedented volatility in the global equity markets 
therefore  period to period comparisons of ours or the industry s net inflows may not be meaningful and not indicative of results in future periods

cash and cash equivalents increased million in primarily due to million of cash flows generated by our operating activities as a result of higher revenues from higher aum  million received from the exercise of stock options and million from the sale of our common stock 
we also received million from the redemption of investment we held during the year 
partly offsetting these increases was million used to purchase new investments 
cash and cash equivalents increased million in primarily due to million of cash flows generated by our operating activities as a result of higher revenues from higher aum offset by million of cash flows used to repurchase our common stock 
we also received million from the redemption of investment we held during the year 
partly offsetting these increases was million net proceeds used to purchase new investments 
cash and cash equivalents increased million in primarily due to million of cash flows generated by our operating activities due to higher revenues from higher assets under management as well as proceeds from net redemptions of our investments 
we also received million from the redemption of investment we held during the year 
partly offsetting these increases was million used to purchase new investments 
capital resources currently  our principal source of financing is our operating cash flow  though historically  our principal source of financing was through the private placement of our common stock 
we believe that current cash flows generated by our operating activities and the net proceeds raised through our offering in february should be sufficient for us to fund our operations for at least the next months 
use of capital our business does not require us to maintain a significant cash position 
we expect that our main uses of cash will be to fund the ongoing operations of our business  invest in strategic growth initiatives  re acquire shares of our common stock issued to our employees as incentive compensation as discussed below or expand our business through strategic acquisitions 
in  we repurchased approximately  shares from our employees at then current market prices at a cost of million and in  we repurchased approximately  shares from our employees at then current market prices at a cost of million in connection with tax withholding upon vesting of restricted stock 
the amount repurchased represented the required amount of tax withholding 
we expect to continue purchasing shares for similar reasons 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future cash payments associated with contractual obligations as of december  total payments due by period in thousands less than year to years to years more than years operating leases off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  which are included in the table above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing or other arrangements 
we have neither created nor are party to any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
critical accounting policies stock based compensation stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at grant date and is recognized over the relevant service period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations  including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date  the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period  the rate of dividends that we may pay during that time and an appropriate risk free interest rate 
many of these assumptions require management s judgment 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
income and deferred taxes we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we have net operating loss carry forwards and we have recognized a deferred tax asset for such carry forwards 
given the significant losses we have incurred since we began our operations  a valuation allowance has been recorded for the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  fasb issued asu no 
amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
asu no 
includes common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between us gaap and ifrs 
asu no 
requires reporting entities to disclose the following information for fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement  the valuation processes used by the reporting entity and a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs 
in addition  asu no 
requires reporting entities to make disclosures about amounts and reasons for all transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial results are subject to market risk 
market risk to us generally represents the risk of changes in the value of financial instruments held in the portfolios of the wisdomtree etfs that generally results from fluctuations in equity prices  foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  and interest rates 
nearly all of our revenue is derived from advisory agreements for the wisdomtree etfs 
under these agreements  the advisory fee we receive is based on the market value of the assets in the wisdomtree etf portfolios we manage 
fluctuations in the value of these securities are common and are generated by numerous factors such as market volatility  the overall economy  inflation  changes in investor strategies  availability of alternative investment vehicles  government regulations and others 
accordingly changes in any one or a combination of these factors may reduce the value of investment securities and  in turn  the underlying assets under management on which our revenues are earned 
these declines may cause investors to withdraw funds from our etfs in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk  thereby compounding the impact on our revenues 
beginning in the second half of and into  global equity markets experienced unprecedented volatility which caused significant declines in our assets under management and revenues during the quarters in that time period 
challenging and volatile market conditions might continue to be present in the foreseeable future 
in order to maximize yields  we invest our corporate cash in short term interest earning assets  primarily money market instruments at a commercial bank and us government and agency debt instruments which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we do not anticipate that changes in interest rates will have a material impact on our financial condition  operating results or cash flows
