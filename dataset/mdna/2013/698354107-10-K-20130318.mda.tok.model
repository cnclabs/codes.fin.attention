overview pandora is the leader in internet radio in the united states  offering a personalized experience for each of our listeners 
we have pioneered a new form of radio one that uses intrinsic qualities of music to initially create stations and then adapts playlists in real time based on the individual feedback of each listener 
as of january   we had approximately million registered users  which we define as the total number of accounts that have been created for our service at period end 
as of january  approximately million registered users have accessed pandora through smartphones and tablets 
for the fiscal year ended january   we streamed billion hours of radio and as of january   we had million active users during the prior day period 
according to a december report by triton  we have more than a share of internet radio among the top stations and networks in the united states 
since we launched our free  advertising supported radio service in our listeners have created over billion stations 

table of contents we derive the substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of display  audio and video advertising for delivery across our traditional computer based  mobile and other connected device platforms 
we also offer a paid subscription service to listeners  which we call pandora one 
while historically our revenue growth was principally attributable to selling display advertising through our traditional computer based platform  we now generate a majority of our revenue from mobile and other connected devices and our advertising includes a mix of audio  display and video 
this expansion of our services also presents an opportunity for us to reach our audience anytime  anywhere they enjoy music  and therefore offer additional distribution channels to current and potential advertisers for delivery of their advertising messages 
growth in our active users and distribution platforms has fueled a corresponding growth in listener hours 
our total number of listener hours is a key driver for both revenue generation opportunities and content acquisition costs  which are the largest component of our operating expenses revenue 
listener hours define the number of opportunities we have to sell advertisements  which we refer to as inventory 
our ability to attract advertisers depends in large part on our ability to offer sufficient inventory within desired demographics 
in turn  our ability to generate revenue depends on the extent to which we are able to sell the inventory we have 
cost of revenue content acquisition costs 
the number of sound recordings we transmit to users of the pandora service  as generally reflected by listener hours  drives substantially all of our content acquisition costs  although certain of our licensing agreements require us to pay fees for public performances based on a percentage of revenue 
we pay royalties to the copyright owners or their agents of each sound recording that we stream and to the copyright owner or their agents of the musical work that underlies that sound recording  subject to certain exclusions 
we record these royalties as content acquisition costs 
under us law  we are granted the right to stream any lawfully released sound recordings  subject to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory requirements 
royalties for sound recordings are negotiated with and paid to record labels or to soundexchange  a performance rights organization pro authorized to collect royalties on behalf of all sound recording copyright owners 
royalties for musical works are negotiated with and paid to publishing companies such as sony atv and entertainment world inc or emi  or pros such as the american society of composers  authors and publishers  or ascap  broadcast music  inc  or bmi  and sesac inc 
or sesac 
royalties are calculated based on sound recordings streamed  revenue earned or other usage measures 
if we cannot agree on royalty rates  the dispute will be resolved by the copyright royalty board  or crb  in the case of soundexchange  and by the rate court in the us district court for the southern district of new york in the case of ascap and bmi 
in november  we filed a petition in rate court to request a determination of reasonable fees and terms with ascap 
in may  we started streaming spoken word comedy content  for which the underlying literary works are not currently entitled to eligibility for licensing by any pro for the united states 
rather  pursuant to industry wide custom and practice  this content is performed absent a specific license from any such performing rights organization 
however  we pay royalties to soundexchange at federally negotiated rates for the right to stream this spoken word comedy content 
given the royalty structures in effect with respect to the public performance of sound recordings in the united states  our content acquisition costs increase with each additional listener hour  regardless of whether we are able to generate more revenue 
as such  our ability to achieve and sustain profitability and operating leverage depends on our ability to increase our revenue per hour of streaming through increased advertising sales across all of our delivery platforms 
while we have generated revenue from our advertising products at a rate that exceeds the growth in listener hours in certain fiscal years for traditional computers and for the fiscal year ending january  for mobile 
table of contents and other connected devices  to date we have not been able to grow our total advertising revenue at a rate that exceeds the growth in our listener hours 
as our mobile listenership increases  we face new challenges in optimizing our advertising products for delivery on mobile and other connected device platforms and monetizing inventory generated by listeners using these platforms 
the mobile digital advertising market is at an early stage of development  with lower overall spending levels than traditional online advertising markets  and faces technical challenges due to fragmented platforms and lack of standard audience measurement protocols 
in addition  our strategy includes increasing the number of ad campaigns for traditional computer  mobile and other connected device platforms sold to local advertisers  placing us in more direct competition with broadcast radio for advertiser spending  especially for audio advertisements 
by contrast  historically our display advertisers have been predominantly national brands 
to successfully monetize our growing listener hours  we may have to convince a substantial base of local advertisers of the benefits of advertising on the pandora service including demonstrating the effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products  and in particular  audio advertising products  across the range of our delivery platforms 
our total revenue has grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal at the same time  our total cost and expenses have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  principally as a result of the growth in content acquisition costs 
as the volume of music we stream to listeners in the united states increases  our content acquisition costs will also increase  regardless of whether we are able to generate more revenue 
in addition  we expect to invest heavily in our operations to support anticipated future growth 
one of our key objectives is furthering our market leadership in internet radio  which we believe will strengthen our brand and help us to convince advertisers to allocate spending towards our ad products 
as such  a central focus is adding  retaining and engaging listeners to build market share and grow our listener hours 
for the foreseeable future  we expect that there will be periods during which our ability to monetize listener hours will lag the growth of listener hours 
as our business matures  we expect that the growth rate in our listener hours will decline relative to our increased ability to monetize listener hours 
however  we expect to incur annual losses on a us gaap basis in the near term 
key metrics the tables below set forth our listener hours for fiscal  and and our active users as of the end of each of those periods along with our total  traditional computer and mobile and other connected devices ad rpms for those periods 
fiscal year ended january  listener hours in billions as of january  active users end of period  in millions 
table of contents advertising revenue per thousand listener hours fiscal year ended january  total traditional computer mobile and other connected devices listener hours 
we track listener hours because it is a key indicator of the growth of our business 
we also track the number of active users as an additional indicator of the breadth of audience we are reaching at a given time  which is particularly important to potential advertisers 
we calculate listener hours based on the total bytes served for each track that is requested and served from our servers  as measured by our internal analytics systems  whether or not a listener listens to the entire track 
we believe this server based approach is the best methodology to forecast advertising inventory given that advertisements are frequently served in between tracks and are often served upon triggers such as a listener clicking thumbs down or choosing to skip a track 
to the extent that third party measurements of listener hours are not calculated using a similar server based approach  the third party measurements may differ from our measurements 
active users 
active users are defined as the number of distinct registered users that have requested audio from our servers within the trailing days to the end of the final calendar month of the period 
the number of active users may overstate the number of unique individuals who actively use our service within a month as one individual may register for  and use  multiple accounts 
ad rpms 
we track advertising revenue per thousand listener hours for our free  advertising supported service ad rpms because it is a key indicator of our ability to monetize advertising inventory created by our listener hours 
we focus on total ad rpms across all of our delivery platforms 
rpms compare advertising revenue generated in a given period to advertising supported listener hours in the period and we believe such total ad rpms to be the central top line indicator for evaluating the results of our monetization efforts 
we calculate total ad rpms by dividing advertising revenue we generate by the number of thousands of listener hours of our advertising based service 
we also provide estimates of disaggregated total and ad rpms for our traditional computer platform as well as our mobile and other connected devices platforms  which we calculate by dividing the estimated advertising revenue generated through the respective platforms by the number of thousands of listener hours of our advertising based service delivered through such platforms 
while we believe that such disaggregated rpms provide directional insight for evaluating our efforts to monetize our service by platform  we do not validate disaggregated rpms to the level of financial statement reporting 
such metrics should be seen as indicative only and as management best estimate 
we continue to refine our systems and methodologies used to categorize rpms across our delivery platforms 
period to period results should not be regarded as precise nor can they be relied upon as indicative of results for future periods 
in addition  as our business matures and in response to technological evolutions  we anticipate that the relevant indicators we monitor for evaluating our business may change 
total ad rpms 
compared to and compared to total ad rpms decreased compared to the respective prior year periods due to the continuing shift in the platform mix between traditional computer and mobile and other connected devices as well as an increase in listener hours  which was in part the result of the effective elimination of the hour per month free listening cap on traditional computers in september which created increased advertising inventory not fully offset by advertising sales 

table of contents traditional computer ad rpms 
compared to traditional computer ad rpms increased compared to the respective prior year period  primarily due to revenue growing at a faster pace than listener hours due to the growth of the sales force as well as the maturation of the underlying market 
traditional computer ad rpms 
compared to traditional computer ad rpms decreased compared to the respective prior year period  primarily due to listener hours growing at a faster pace than revenue due in part to the effective elimination of the hour per month free listening cap which created increased listener hours not fully offset by increased advertising sales and to our sales force increased focus on improving mobile advertising sales 
mobile and other connected device ad rpms 
compared to and compared to mobile and other connected device ad rpms increased compared to the respective prior year periods primarily due to mobile and connected device revenue growing at a faster pace than listening hours 
faster relative growth in revenue was driven by our continued focus on monetizing our mobile inventory including the introduction of new advertising products  particularly audio advertising  for these devices 
the increase in rpms for the fiscal year ended january  was partially offset by the effect of direct advertising sales to one customer which accounted for of revenue in the fiscal year ended january  specific to the revenue component of the rpm ratio  total advertising revenue increased by approximately during the fiscal year ended january  compared to the prior year period  with advertising revenue on mobile and other connected devices increasing approximately and advertising revenue on traditional computers increasing by approximately 
total advertising revenue increased by approximately during the fiscal year ended january  compared to the prior year period  with advertising revenue on mobile and other connected devices increasing by approximately and advertising revenue on traditional computers increasing by approximately respectively 
in addition to ad rpms  we also track total rpms  which measure total revenue  including both advertising and subscription services and other revenue  compared to total listener hours 
we calculate total rpms by dividing the estimated total revenue generated through the respective platforms by the total number of thousands of listener hours delivered through such platforms 
while we believe that such disaggregated total rpms provide directional insight for evaluating our efforts to monetize our service by platform  we do not validate disaggregated total rpms to the level of financial statement reporting 
such metrics should be seen as indicative only and as management best estimate 
total rpms for the fiscal years ended january   and were to  and  respectively 
within this  mobile and other connected device total rpms for the fiscal years ended january   and  were  and respectively 
traditional computer rpms for the fiscal years ended january   and  were  and  respectively 
these changes were driven by the same factors mentioned above within the discussion of ad rpms 
basis of presentation revenue advertising revenue 
we generate advertising revenue primarily from display  audio and video advertising  which is typically sold on a cost per thousand impressions  or cpm  basis 
advertising campaigns typically range from to months  and advertisers generally pay us based on a minimum number of delivered impressions or the satisfaction of other criteria  such as click throughs 
we may earn referral revenue when  for example  a listener clicks on an advertisement and signs up for membership with an advertiser 
we also have arrangements with advertising agencies and brokers pursuant to which we provide the ability to sell advertising inventory on our service directly to advertisers 
we report revenue under these arrangements net of amounts due to agencies and brokers 

table of contents in fiscal  and  advertising revenue accounted for  and of our total revenue  respectively  and we expect that advertising will comprise a substantial majority of revenue for the foreseeable future 
our ability to attract advertisers  and ultimately generate advertising revenue  is critical to our financial success 
we believe that we provide a unique and commercially attractive advertising opportunity for our advertisers  including the ability to run multi platform ad campaigns and to present ads while our listeners actively engage with our service 
although advertisers as a whole are spending an increasing amount of their advertising budget on online advertising  we face a number of challenges 
specifically  we compete for advertising dollars with significantly larger and more established online marketing and media companies  such as facebook  google  msn and yahoo 
in addition  our audio advertising products target advertisers that traditionally advertise on broadcast radio and are less familiar with internet radio advertising media 
subscription services and other revenue 
we generate subscription revenue through the sale and activation of access to a premium version of the pandora service for annual or monthly subscription fees of per year or approximately per month  respectively  which currently includes an ad free environment and  on devices that support it  higher quality audio 
we receive the full amount of the subscription payment at the time of sale 
subscription revenue derived from direct sales to listeners is recognized on a straight line basis over the duration of the subscription period 
subscription revenue derived from sales through some mobile operating systems may be subject to refund or cancellation terms which may affect the timing or amount of the subscription revenue recognition 
when refund rights exist  we recognize revenue when services have been provided and the rights lapse or when we have developed sufficient transaction history to estimate a reserve 
as of january   we deferred revenue of approximately million related to refund rights 
until september  for listeners who are not subscribers  we limited usage of our advertising supported service on desktop and laptop computers to hours per month 
listeners who reached this limit could continue to use this service by paying for the remainder of the month 
we included this revenue in subscription services and other revenue 
in september  we effectively eliminated the hour per month listening cap on desktop and laptop computers by increasing the cap to hours of listening per month  which almost none of our listeners exceed 
in fiscal  subscription services and other revenue accounted for of our total revenue 
deferred revenue 
our deferred revenue consists principally of both prepaid but unrecognized subscription revenue and advertising fees received or billed in advance of the delivery or completion of the delivery of services 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the services are provided and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
costs and expenses costs and expenses consist of cost of revenue  product development  marketing and sales  general and administrative and content acquisition costs 
content acquisition costs are the most significant component of our costs and expenses followed by employee related costs  which includes stock based compensation expenses 
we expect to continue to hire additional employees in order to support our anticipated growth and our product development initiatives 
in any particular period  the timing of additional hires could materially affect our operating expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
we anticipate that our costs and expenses will increase in the future 
cost of revenue content acquisition costs 
content acquisition costs principally consist of royalties paid for streaming music or other content to our listeners 
royalties are calculated using negotiated rates documented in master royalty agreements and are based on both percentage of revenue and listening metrics 
for example in fiscal and  under some royalty arrangements 
table of contents we paid a fee per track  while in other cases we paid royalties based on a percentage of our revenue 
in still other cases we pay royalties based on a combination of these metrics 
in fiscal and we also paid royalties on a fee per session basis 
we periodically test our royalty calculation methods to ensure we are accurately reporting and paying royalties 
the performance rights organizations have the right to audit our playlist and payment records  and any such audit could result in disputes over whether we have paid the proper royalties 
if such a dispute were to occur  we could be required to pay additional royalties and the amounts involved could be material 
for royalty arrangements under negotiation  we accrue for estimated royalties based on the available facts and circumstances and adjust these estimates as more information becomes available 
the results of any finalized negotiation may be materially different from our estimates 
in july we  together with other webcasters  negotiated new royalty rates on performances with soundexchange for calendar years to the agreement reduced rates originally established by the copyright royalty board for calendar years to and established new rates for calendar years to cost of revenue other 
cost of revenue consists of hosting costs  infrastructure and the employee and employee related costs associated with supporting those functions 
hosting costs consist of content streaming  maintaining our internet radio service and creating and serving advertisements through third party ad servers 
infrastructure costs consist of equipment  software  facilities and depreciation 
we make payments to third party ad servers for the period the advertising impressions or click through actions are delivered or occur  and accordingly  we record this as a cost of revenue in the related period 
product development 
product development expenses consist of employee compensation  information technology  consulting  facilities related expenses and costs associated with supporting consumer connected device manufacturers in implementing our service in their products 
we incur product development expenses primarily for improvements to our website and the pandora app  development of new advertising products and development and enhancement of our personalized station s generating system 
we have generally expensed product development as incurred 
certain website development and internal use software development costs may be capitalized when specific criteria are met 
in such cases  the capitalized amounts are amortized over the useful life of the related application once the application is placed in service 
we intend to continue making significant investments in developing new products and enhancing the functionality of our existing products 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist of employee and employee related costs including salaries  commissions and benefits related to employees in sales  marketing and advertising departments 
in addition  marketing and sales expenses include external sales and marketing expenses such as third party marketing  branding  advertising  and public relations expenses  transactional subscription processing fees on mobile platforms  and infrastructure costs such as facility and other supporting overhead costs 
we expect marketing and sales expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel to build out our sales force and ad operations team and expand our business development team to establish relationships with manufacturers of an increasing number of connected devices 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include employee and employee related costs consisting of salaries and benefits for finance  accounting  legal  internal information technology and other administrative personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional services costs for outside legal and accounting services  and infrastructure costs for facility  supporting overhead costs and merchant and other transaction costs  such as credit card fees 
we 
table of contents expect to incur significant additional expenses in future periods as we continue to invest in corporate infrastructure  including adding personnel and systems to our finance and administrative functions 
provision for income taxes 
we have historically been subject to income taxes only in the united states 
as we expand our operations outside the united states  we have become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly 
income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory income tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized

fiscal year ended january  traditional computer mobile and other connected devices the majority of our royalties are payable based on a fee per track  while in other cases our royalties are payable based on a percentage of our revenue or a combination of per track and revenue metrics 
we estimate our advertising based content acquisition costs attributable to specific platforms by allocating costs from royalties payable based on a fee per track to the platform for which the track is served and by allocating costs from royalties based on a percentage of our revenue in accordance with the overall percentage of our revenue estimated to be attributable to such platforms 
while we believe 
table of contents that comparing disaggregated content acquisition costs and revenues across our delivery platforms may provide directional insight for evaluating our efforts to monetize the rapid adoption of our service on mobile and other connected devices  we do not validate such disaggregated metrics to the level of financial statement reporting

our principal uses of cash during the fiscal year ending january  were funding our operations  as described below  and capital expenditures 
sources of funds we believe  based on our current operating plan  that our existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
from time to time  we may explore additional financing sources and means to lower our cost of capital  which could include equity  equity linked and debt financing 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional debt  equity or equity linked financing or a combination thereof 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
our indebtedness credit facility 
on may   we entered into a million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions 
the amount of borrowings available under the credit facility at any time is based on our monthly accounts receivable balance at such time  and the amounts borrowed are collateralized by our personal property including such accounts receivable but excluding intellectual property 
at our option  drawn amounts under the credit facility will bear an interest rate of either i an adjusted 
table of contents london interbank offered  or libo  rate plus a if the debt outstanding is greater than or equal to million or b if the debt outstanding is less than million or ii an alternate base rate plus x if the debt outstanding is greater than or equal to million or y if the debt outstanding is less than million 
the adjusted libo rate is the libo rate for a particular interest period multiplied by the statutory reserve rate 
the alternate base rate is the greatest of the prime rate  the federal funds effective rate plus and the adjusted libo rate plus 
in addition  we are obligated to pay a non usage charge on the available balance 
the non usage charge is if the debt outstanding is greater than or equal to million or if the debt outstanding is less than million 
under the credit facility  we can request up to million in letters of credit be issued by the financial institutions 
the annual charge for any outstanding letters of credit is if the debt letters of credit outstanding is less than million or if the debt letters of credit outstanding is greater than or equal to million 
the credit facility contains customary events of default  conditions to borrowing and covenants  including restrictions on our ability to dispose of assets  make acquisitions  incur debt  incur liens and make distributions to stockholders 
the credit facility also includes a financial covenant requiring the maintenance of minimum liquidity of at least million 
during the continuance of an event of a default  the lenders may accelerate amounts outstanding  terminate the credit facility and foreclose on all collateral 
any inability to meet our debt service obligation could have material consequences on our security holders 
as of january   the company had  in letters of credit outstanding and had million of available borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
on december   the company entered into a cash collateral agreement in connection with the issuance of letters of credit which were used to satisfy deposit requirements under facility leases 
as of january   the  cash collateral was considered to be restricted cash 
the amount is included in other assets on the company balance sheet 
capital expenditures consistent with previous periods  future capital expenditures will primarily focus on acquiring additional hosting and general corporate infrastructure 
based on current estimates  we believe that our anticipated capital expenditures will be adequate to implement our current plans

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than year in thousands purchase obligation operating lease obligations total purchase obligation purchase obligation represents a non cancelable contractual obligation at january  related to a branding agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements as of january   and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
business trends our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors 
we expect our operating results to continue to fluctuate in future quarters 
our results may reflect the effects of some seasonal trends in listener behavior due to increased internet usage and sales of media streaming devices during certain vacation and holiday periods 
for example  we expect to experience increased usage during the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to the holiday season  and in the first quarter of each calendar year due to increased use of media streaming devices received as gifts during the holiday season 
we may also experience higher advertising sales during the fourth quarter of each calendar year due to greater advertiser demand during the holiday season and lower advertising sales during the first quarter of each calendar year due to seasonally adjusted advertising demand 
while we believe these seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our operating results  our trajectory of rapid growth may have overshadowed these effects to date 
we believe that our business may become more seasonal in the future and that such seasonal variations in listener behavior may result in fluctuations in our financial results 
in addition  expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical and discretionary in nature  reflecting overall economic conditions  the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries  budgeting constraints and buying patterns and a variety of other factors  many of which are outside our control 
for example  an advertiser which accounted for more than of our advertising revenue for the first two quarters of fiscal did not meet this threshold for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal as a result of these and other factors  the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance 
growth in listening on mobile and other connected devices continues to outpace growth in listening on traditional computer based devices 
while historically we have not limited the usage of our advertising supported service on mobile devices  in march we instituted a hour listening cap on these devices 
listeners who reach this limit may continue to use our ad supported service on these devices by paying for the remainder of the month  may listen to our ad supported service on their desktop or laptop computers or may purchase annual or monthly pandora one subscriptions for per year or approximately per month  respectively 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with our revenue recognition  stock based compensation  stock option grants and common stock valuations  and accounting for income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which the products or services will be provided  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we consider a signed agreement  a binding insertion order or other similar documentation to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including transaction history and the creditworthiness of a customer 
if it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we record cash received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue 
advertising revenue we generate the majority of our revenue through the delivery of advertising impressions sold on a cost per thousand  or cpm  basis 
we generally recognize revenue based on delivery information from our campaign trafficking systems 
we record revenue from these performance based actions when we receive third party verification reports supporting the number of actions performed in the period 
we generally have audit rights to the underlying data summarized in these reports 
subscription services and other revenue subscription revenue is generated through the sale of a premium version of the pandora service which currently includes higher audio quality and advertisement free access 
subscription revenue derived from direct sales to listeners is recognized on a straight line basis over the duration of the subscription period 
subscription revenue derived from sales through some mobile operating systems may be subject to refund or cancellation terms which may affect the timing or amount of the subscription revenue recognition 
when refund rights exist  we recognize revenue when services have been provided and the rights lapse or when we have developed sufficient transaction history to estimate a reserve 
as of january   we had deferred revenue of approximately million related to refund rights 
until september  a small portion of subscription revenue was also generated from usage based fees when a listener who did not have access to a premium version of the pandora service reached a maximum number of listening hours on traditional computers in a given month 
the listener was required to pay a nominal fee to continue the advertising supported listening experience on traditional computers for the remainder of the month 
revenue from usage based fees was recognized in the month the maximum number of listening hours was exceeded 
in september  we effectively eliminated the hour per month listening cap on desktop and laptop computers by increasing the cap to hours of listening per month  which almost none of our listeners exceed 

table of contents revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements we enter into arrangements with customers to sell advertising packages that include different media placements or ad services that are delivered at the same time  or within close proximity of one another 
because we had not yet established the fair value for each element and our agreements contain mid campaign cancellation clauses  advertising sales revenue prior to february  was recognized as the lowest of revenue calculated on a time based straight line basis over the term of the contract  revenue calculated on a proportional performance basis  based on cpm for the entire campaign multiplied by the number of impressions delivered to date and revenue based on the delivered media and price as specified on the applicable insertion order 
significant creative or engineering professional services provided adjunct to a campaign are not considered to have standalone value 
as a result  we recognized revenue for all elements of multiple element arrangements as a single unit of accounting over the delivery period 
beginning on february   we adopted new authoritative guidance on multiple element arrangements using the prospective method for all arrangements entered into or materially modified from the date of adoption 
under this new guidance we allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables or those packages in which all components of the package are delivered at the same time  based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy  which includes vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  if available  third party evidence  or tpe  if vsoe is not available  and best estimate of selling price  or besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
besp is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in our multiple element arrangements 
we determine besp for deliverables by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  prices we charge for similar offerings  sales volume  market conditions  competitive landscape and pricing practices 
we recognize the relative fair value of the media placements or ad services as they are delivered assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
as a result of implementing this recent authoritative guidance  we recognized million as revenue in the fiscal year ended january  that would have been deferred under the previous guidance for multiple element arrangements 
stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation expenses for employees at the grant date fair value of the award  and recognize expenses on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we account for stock options issued to non employees in accordance with the guidance for equity based payments to non employees 
we believe that the fair value of stock options is more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received 
as such  the fair value of the unvested portion of the options granted to non employees is re measured each period 
the resulting increase in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 
we generally estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of a stock based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our statements of operations 

table of contents prior to our ipo  our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair market value of our common stock at each meeting at which stock options were granted and approved 
stock based compensation expenses are classified in the statement of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports 
our stock based awards are comprised principally of stock options and restricted stock unit awards 
accounting for income taxes we account for our income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or in our income tax returns 
deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory income tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we will recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision in the accompanying statement of operations 
we calculate our current and deferred income tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years 
adjustments based on filed income tax returns are recorded when identified 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to examination by us federal  state and international tax authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management assessment of relevant risks  facts and circumstances existing at that time 
to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions change  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business  including interest rate and inflation risks 
interest rate fluctuation risk our exposure to interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
in may  we entered into a million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions 
any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility bear a variable interest rate and therefore the interest we pay as well as the fair value of our outstanding borrowings will fluctuate as changes occur in certain benchmark interest rates 
as of january   we had not drawn any amounts under the credit facility but had  of letters of credit outstanding 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
approximately half of our portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents that have a relatively short maturity  and a fair value relatively insensitive to interest rate 
table of contents changes 
our fixed income marketable securities have maturities of less than six months  but do carry some degree of interest rate risk and may have their fair market values adversely impacted by higher interest rates 
we do not believe that a hypothetical increase in interest rates as of january  would have had a material impact on our investment portfolio 
we have currently determined  consistent with our investment objectives  that the potential increase in yield would not warrant investing our excess cash in longer term investments 
in future periods  we will continue to evaluate our investment policy in order to ensure that we continue to meet our overall objectives 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
