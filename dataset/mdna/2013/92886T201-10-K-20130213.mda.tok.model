item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors  including the factors we describe under item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of communications services connecting people through cloud connected devices worldwide 
we rely heavily on our network  which is a flexible  scalable session initiation protocol sip based voice over internet protocol  or voip  network 
this platform enables a user via a single identity  either a number or user name  to access and utilize services and features regardless of how they are connected to the internet  including over g  g  cable  or dsl broadband networks 
this technology enables us to offer our customers attractively priced voice and messaging services and other features around the world on a variety of devices 
over the past five years  we have fundamentally transformed our company strategically  operationally and financially 
strategically  we shifted our primary focus to serving rapidly growing but under served ethnic segments in the united states with international calling needs 
we improved our value proposition by being the first to deliver flat rate  unlimited calling to over countries with the launch of our vonage world service  and we were the first to provide easy to use  enhanced features  like voice to text translation and mobile extension services  at no extra cost 
these strategic shifts have resulted in new customers with a higher average lifetime value and a better churn profile than those in the past 
our focus on operations during this period has resulted in a significantly improved cost structure 
we have implemented operational efficiencies throughout our business and have reduced domestic and international termination costs per minute  and customer care costs 
importantly  we have enabled structural cost reductions while significantly improving network call quality and customer service performance 
improvements in the overall customer experience have contributed to lower churn  which declined from highs of in july to at the end of the through debt refinancings in december and july  we have fundamentally improved our balance sheet  reducing annual interest expense from million in to million in and reducing interest rates from as high as in to less than today 
in part as a result of our operational and financial stability  on february   vonage board of directors discontinued the remainder of our existing share repurchase program effective at the close of business on february  with  remaining  and authorized a new program to repurchase up to  of the company outstanding shares by december  we believe our repurchase program reflects our balanced approach to capital allocation as we invest for growth through our growth initiatives and deliver value to shareholders without compromising our ongoing operational needs 
having achieved operational and financial stability  we are focused on driving revenue through three major growth initiatives 
the first growth initiative is in our core north american markets  where we will continue to provide extraordinary value in international long distance calling  while targeting under served ethnic segments  and expect to enter the low end domestic market with a secondary brand 
our second growth initiative is international expansion outside of north america through strategic partnerships 
our third growth initiative is mobile services which we view as a strategic enabler of the company entire product offering over time 
we had approximately million subscriber lines for broadband telephone replacement services as of december  we bill customers in the united states  canada  and the united kingdom 
customers in the united states represented of our subscriber lines at december  recent developments amended credit agreement 
on february   we entered into an amendment to the credit facility that we entered into in july the credit facility 
the amendment the credit facility consists of a  senior secured term loan and a  revolving credit facility 
the co borrowers under the credit facility are us and vonage america inc  our wholly owned subsidiary 
obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed  fully and unconditionally  by our other united states subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of the assets of each borrower and each of the guarantors 
we used  of the available proceeds of the credit facility to retire all of the debt under our credit facility 
share repurchase authorization 
on february   vonage board of directors discontinued the remainder of our existing share repurchase program effective at the close of business on february  with  remaining  and authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to  of the company outstanding shares 
this new authorization expires on december  the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on available capital resources and other financial and operational performance  market conditions  securities law limitations  and other factors 
the repurchases will be made using our cash resources 
the repurchase program may be commenced  suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
in any period  cash used in financing activities related to common stock repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders equity  reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash 
joint venture with datora in brazil 
on february   we entered into our second international partnership  a joint venture with datora telecomunicacoes ltda 
datora  to deliver communication services in brazil 
our partner  datora  is a telecom operator in brazil delivering managed business to business and termination services throughout south america and other parts of the world 
datora also has a significant physical presence in brazilian economic centers 
we expect this partnership to accelerate our entry into the brazilian market 
trends in our industry and key operating data a number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements 
competitive landscape 
we face intense competition from traditional telephone companies  wireless companies  cable companies  and alternative voice communication providers 
most traditional wireline and wireless telephone service providers and cable companies are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base 
in addition  because our competitors provide other services  they often choose to offer voip services or other voice services as part of a bundle that includes other products  such as internet access  cable television  and home telephone service  with an implied price for telephone service that vonage annual report 
table of contents may be significantly below ours 
in addition  such competitors may in the future require new customers or existing customers making changes to their service to purchase voice services when purchasing high speed internet access 
further  as wireless providers offer more minutes at lower prices  better coverage  and companion landline alternative services  their services have become more attractive to households as a replacement for wireline service 
we also compete against alternative voice communication providers  such as magicjack  skype  and google voice 
some of these service providers have chosen to sacrifice telephony revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at low prices or for free 
as we continue to introduce applications that integrate different forms of voice and messaging services over multiple devices  we are facing competition from emerging competitors focused on similar integration  as well as from alternative voice communication providers 
in addition  our competitors have partnered and may in the future partner with other competitors to offer products and services  leveraging their collective competitive positions 
we also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies 
in connection with our increasing emphasis on the international long distance market  we face competition from low cost international calling cards and voip providers in addition to traditional telephone companies  cable companies  and wireless companies 
broadband adoption 
the number of united states households with broadband internet access has grown significantly 
on march   the federal communications commission fcc released its national broadband plan  which seeks  through supporting broadband deployment and programs  to encourage broadband adoption for the approximately million united states residents who do not have broadband at home 
we expect the trend of greater broadband adoption to continue 
we benefit from this trend because our service requires a broadband internet connection and our potential addressable market increases as broadband adoption increases 
regulation 
our business has developed in a relatively lightly regulated environment 
the united states and other countries  however  are examining how voip services should be regulated 
a november order by the fcc that permits states to impose state universal service fund obligations on voip service  discussed in note to our financial statements  is an example of efforts by regulators to determine how voip service fits into the telecommunications regulatory landscape 
in addition to regulatory matters that directly address voip  a number of other regulatory initiatives could impact our business 
one such regulatory initiative is net neutrality 
in december  the fcc adopted a revised set of net neutrality rules for broadband internet service providers 
these rules make it more difficult for broadband internet service providers to block or discriminate against vonage service 
several broadband internet service providers have filed appeals of the fcc new rules at the dc circuit court of appeals alleging that the fcc lacks authority to apply its rules to broadband internet service providers 
in addition  on february   the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking on reforming universal service and the intercarrier compensation icc system that governs payments between telecommunications carriers primarily for terminating traffic 
the fcc adoption of an icc proposal will impact vonage costs for telecommunications services 
on october   the fcc adopted an order reforming universal service and icc 
the fcc order provides that voip originated calls will be subject to interstate access charges for long distance calls and reciprocal compensation for local calls that terminate to the public switched telephone network pstn 
the termination charges for all traffic  including voip originated traffic  will transition over several years to a bill and keep arrangement ie  no termination charges 
numerous parties filed appeals of the fcc icc order 
we believe that the order  if effected  will positively impact our costs over time 
see also the discussion under regulation in note to our financial statements for a discussion of regulatory issues that impact us 
the table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of our business for the years ended december  gross subscriber line additions change in net subscriber lines subscriber lines at period end average monthly customer churn average monthly operating revenues per line average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line marketing costs per gross subscriber line addition employees excluding temporary help at period end gross subscriber line additions 
gross subscriber line additions for a particular period are calculated by taking the net subscriber line additions during that particular period and adding to that the number of subscriber lines that terminated during that period 
this number does not include subscriber lines both added and terminated during the period  where termination occurred within the first days after activation 
the number does include  however  subscriber lines added during the period that are terminated within days of activation but after the end of the period 
net subscriber line additions 
net subscriber line additions for a particular period reflect the number of subscriber lines at the end of the period  less the number of subscriber lines at the beginning of the period 
subscriber lines 
our subscriber lines include  as of a particular date  all paid subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date 
our subscriber lines include fax lines and soft phones but do not include our virtual phone numbers or toll free numbers  which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers 
subscriber lines decreased by  from  as of december  to  as of december  this decrease was partially attributable to the removal of unlimited calling to pakistan from our vonage world plan in the fourth quarter of due to a government imposed increase in termination costs 
average monthly customer churn 
average monthly customer churn for a particular period is calculated by dividing the number of customers that terminated during that period by the simple average number of customers during the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period  plus the number of customers on the last day of the period  divided by two 
terminations  as used in the calculation of churn statistics  do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first days after activation 
our average monthly customer churn was flat at for compared to our average monthly customer churn declined year over year from for the three months ended december  to for the three months ended december  the decline in churn was a result of reintroduction of a service period requirement  sustained improvements in customer satisfaction and more effective retention processes 
our average monthly customer churn remained the same sequentially for the three months ended december  from the three months ended september  there was an increase in vonage annual report 
table of contents churn due to the removal of unlimited calling to pakistan from our vonage world plan as a result of significant increases in call completion costs to pakistan imposed by regulatory authorities in pakistan  offset by the decrease in churn as a result of sustained improvements in customer satisfaction and more effective retention processes 
we monitor churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction 
other companies may calculate churn differently  and their churn data may not be directly comparable to ours 
customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not 
in addition  our customers who are international callers generally churn at a lower rate than customers who are domestic callers 
our churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions  competitive pressures  marketplace perception of our services  and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services 
average monthly operating revenues per line 
average monthly revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period  plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period  divided by two 
our average monthly revenue per line decreased to for compared to for this decrease was due primarily to the expansion of lower priced plan offerings to meet customer segment needs  and lower activation fee revenue  offset by selected pricing actions  higher priced rate plans  and higher usf fees 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our direct cost of telephony services for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
we use the average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line to evaluate how effective we are at managing our costs of providing service 
our average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line decreased slightly to for compared to for  due primarily to the decrease in domestic termination costs due to a lower customer base and more favorable rates negotiated with our service providers and the decrease in our network costs and in our e costs  offset by the increase in international calling by our growing base of vonage world customers and an increase in regulatory fees 
direct cost of telephony services both overall and on a per line basis is expected to experience upward pressure from increased international calling by our base of vonage world customers offset by intelligent call routing  peering relationships  and improved pricing from various carriers 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition is calculated by dividing our marketing expense for a particular period by the number of gross subscriber line additions during the period 
marketing expense does not include the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions  which are accounted for as an offset to revenues  or customer equipment subsidies  which are accounted for as direct cost of goods sold 
as a result  it does not represent the full cost to us of obtaining a new customer 
our marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition increased to for from in  due primarily to television and direct mail marketing investment efficiency  the market test of our low priced domestic offer  and less line additions due to the removal of unlimited calling to pakistan from our vonage world plan in the fourth quarter of due to a government imposed increase in termination costs 
employees 
employees represent the number of personnel that are on our payroll and exclude temporary or outsourced labor 
operating revenues revenues consist of telephony services revenue and customer equipment and shipping revenue 
substantially all of our revenues are telephony services revenue 
in the united states  we offer domestic and international rate plans to meet the needs of our customers  including a variety of residential plans  mobile plans  and small office and home office calling plans 
the vonage world plan  now available in the united states and canada  offers unlimited calling across the united states and puerto rico  unlimited international calling to over countries including india  mexico  and china  subject to certain restrictions  and free voicemail to text messages with vonage visual voicemail 
each of our unlimited plans other than vonage world offers unlimited domestic calling as well as unlimited calling to puerto rico  canada  and selected european countries  subject to certain restrictions 
each of our basic plans offers a limited number of domestic calling minutes per month 
we offer similar plans in canada 
under our basic plans  we charge on a per minute basis when the number of domestic calling minutes included in the plan is exceeded for a particular month 
international calls except for calls to puerto rico  canada and certain european countries under our unlimited plans and a variety of countries under international calling plans and vonage world are charged on a per minute basis 
these per minute fees are not included in our monthly subscription fees 
in addition to our landline telephony business  we are leveraging our technology to offer services and applications for mobile and other connected devices to address large existing markets 
we introduced our first mobile offering in late and in early we introduced vonage mobile  our all in one mobile application that provides free calling and messaging between users who have the application  as well as traditional paid international calling to any other phone 
this mobile application works over wifi  g and g and in more than countries worldwide 
the application consolidates the best features of our prior applications  while adding important functionality  value and ease of use including direct payment through itunes 
we derive most of our telephony services revenue from monthly subscription fees that we charge our customers under our service plans 
we also offer residential fax service  virtual phone numbers  toll free numbers and other services  and charge an additional monthly fee for each service 
one business fax line is included with each of our two small office and home office plans  but we charge monthly fees for additional business fax lines 
we automatically charge these fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards  or electronic check payments ecp  monthly in advance 
we also automatically charge the per minute fees not included in our monthly subscription fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards or ecp monthly in arrears unless they exceed a certain dollar threshold  in which case they are charged immediately 
by collecting monthly subscription fees in advance and certain other charges immediately after they are incurred  we are able to reduce the amount of accounts receivable that we have outstanding  thus allowing us to have lower working capital requirements 
collecting in this manner also helps us mitigate bad debt losses  which are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
if a customer s credit card  debit card or ecp is declined  we generally suspend international calling capabilities as well as the customer s ability to incur domestic usage charges in excess of their plan minutes 
historically  in most cases  we are able to correct the problem with the customer within the current monthly billing cycle 
if the customer s credit card  debit card or ecp could not be successfully processed during three billing cycles ie  the current and two subsequent monthly billing cycles  we terminate the account 
in the united states  we charge regulatory  compliance  e  and intellectual property related recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray costs  and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services 
in addition  we recognize revenue on a gross basis for contributions to the federal universal service fund usf and related fees 
all other taxes are recorded on a net basis 
in addition  historically  we charged a disconnect fee for customers who terminated their service plan within the first twelve months of service 
disconnect fees are recorded as revenue and are recognized at the time the customer terminates service 
beginning in september  we eliminated the disconnect fee for new customers 
in february of we re introduced service agreements as an option for new customers

accordingly  we released the related valuation allowance against our united states and canada net deferred tax assets  and a portion of the allowance against our state net deferred tax assets as certain nols may expire prior to utilization due to shorter utilization periods in certain states  resulting in a one time non cash income tax benefit of  that we recorded in our vonage annual report

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including the following the useful lives of property and equipment  software costs  and intangible assets  assumptions used for the purpose of determining share based compensation and the fair value of our prior stock warrant using the black scholes option pricing model model  and various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable  the key inputs for this model are our stock price at valuation date  exercise price  the dividend yield  risk free interest rate  life in years  and historical volatility of our common stock  assumptions used in determining the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets  assumptions used to determine the fair value of the embedded conversion option within our prior third lien convertible notes using the monte carlo simulation model  the key inputs are maturity date  risk free interest rate  our stock price at valuation date  and historical volatility of our common stock  and assumptions used to determine the fair value of the embedded make whole premium feature within our prior senior secured first lien credit facility and our prior senior secured second lien credit facility 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available market information  appropriate valuation methodologies  and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition the point in time at which revenues are recognized is determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition 
at the time a customer signs up for our telephony services  there are the following deliverables providing equipment  if any  to the customer that enables our telephony services and providing telephony services 
the equipment is provided free of charge to our customers and in most instances there are no fees collected at sign up 
we record the fees collected for shipping the equipment to the customer  if any  as shipping and handling revenue at the time of shipment 
a further description of our revenues is as follows substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenues  which are derived primarily from monthly subscription fees that customers are charged under our service plans 
we also derive telephony services revenues from per minute fees for international calls if not covered under a plan  including applications for mobile devices and other stand alone products  and for any calling minutes in excess of a customer s monthly plan limits 
monthly subscription fees are automatically charged to customers credit cards  debit cards or electronic check payments  or ecp  in advance and are recognized over the following month when services are provided 
revenues generated from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans are recognized as services are provided  that is  as minutes are used  and are billed to a customer s credit cards  debit cards or ecp in arrears 
as a result of our multiple billing cycles each month  we estimate the amount of revenues earned from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily upon historical minutes and have been consistent with our actual results 
we also provide rebates to customers who purchase their customer equipment from retailers and satisfy minimum service period requirements 
these rebates in excess of activation fees are recorded as a reduction of revenues over the service period based upon the estimated number of customers that will ultimately earn and claim the rebates 
customer equipment and shipping revenues include sales to our retailers  who subsequently resell this customer equipment to customers 
revenues were reduced for payments to retailers and rebates to customers  who purchased their customer equipment through these retailers  to the extent of customer equipment and shipping revenues 
inventory inventory consists of the cost of customer equipment and is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the average cost method 
we provide an inventory allowance for customer equipment that has been returned by customers but may not be able to be reissued to new customers or returned to the manufacturer for credit 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment 
our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards nols 
we are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets namely  the nols prior to expiration 
we periodically review this conclusion  which requires significant management judgment 
if we are able to conclude in a future period that a future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized  we are required in that period to reduce the related valuation allowance with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense 
this will result in a non cash benefit to our net income in the period of the determination 
in the future  if available evidence changes our conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will utilize our net deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  we will make an adjustment to the related valuation allowance and income tax expense at that time 
in the fourth quarter of  we released  of valuation allowance see note income taxes 
in subsequent periods  we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate  an expense that was not recognized prior to the reduction of the valuation allowance
