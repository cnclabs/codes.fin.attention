general the following management discussion and analysis provides a narrative of the results of operations and financial condition of ilg for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this form k for the year ended december   which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this discussion includes the following sections management overview critical accounting policies and estimates results of operations financial position  liquidity and capital resources ilg principles of financial reporting reconciliations of non gaap measures 
table of contents management overview history ilg was incorporated as a delaware corporation in may in connection with a plan by iac interactivecorp  or iac  to separate into five publicly traded companies  referred to as the spin off 
ilg was formed to hold the membership and exchange and management and rental businesses  and commenced trading on the nasdaq stock market in august under the symbol iilg 
the membership and exchange operating segment consists of interval international inc businesses  referred to as interval  and the membership and exchange related line of business of tpi and vri 
the management and rental operating segment consists of aston hotels resorts  llc and maui condo and home  llc  referred to as aston  and the management and rental related line of business of vri and tpi 
basis of presentation and accounting estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and reflect the financial position and operating results of ilg 
ilg management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
they also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the recovery of goodwill and long lived and other intangible assets  purchase price allocations  the determination of deferred income taxes including related valuation allowances  the determination of deferred revenue and membership costs  and the determination of stock based compensation 
in the opinion of ilg management  the assumptions underlying the historical consolidated financial statements of ilg and its subsidiaries are reasonable 
general description of our business ilg is a leading global provider of membership and leisure services to the vacation industry 
we operate in two operating segments membership and exchange and management and rental 
our principal operating segment  membership and exchange  offers travel and leisure related products and services to owners of vacation interests and others primarily through various membership programs  as well as related services to resort developer clients 
management and rental  our other business segment  provides hotel  condominium resort  timeshare resort and homeowners association management  and rental services to both vacation property owners and vacationers 
membership and exchange services interval  the principal business comprising our membership and exchange segment  has been a leader in the membership and exchange services industry since its founding in as of december   interval primary operation is the interval network  a quality global vacation ownership membership exchange network with a large and diversified base of participating resorts consisting of nearly  resorts located in over countries  including both leading independent resort developers and branded hospitality companies  and approximately million vacation ownership interest owners enrolled as members of the interval network 

table of contents interval typically enters into multi year contracts with developers of vacation ownership resorts  pursuant to which the resort developers agree to enroll all purchasers of vacation interests at the applicable resort as members of an interval exchange program 
in return  interval provides enrolled purchasers with the ability to exchange the use and occupancy of their vacation interest at the home resort generally for a period of one week for the right to occupy accommodations at a different resort participating in an interval exchange network 
through interval getaways  members may rent resort accommodations for a fee without relinquishing the use of their vacation interest 
in addition  interval offers sales  marketing and operational support  consulting and back office services  including reservation servicing  to certain resort developers participating in the interval network  upon their request and for additional consideration 
the membership and exchange segment earns most of its revenue from i fees paid for membership in the interval network and ii interval network transactional and service fees paid primarily for exchanges  getaways  reservation servicing  and related transactions collectively referred to as transaction revenue 
management and rental services we also provide management and rental services to hotels as well as condominium and timeshare resorts and their homeowners associations through aston  vri and tpi 
such vacation properties and hotels are not owned by us 
aston is based in hawaii and concentrates largely on hotel and condominium resort management primarily in hawaii  as well as vacation property rental and related services including common area and owner association management services for condominium projects 
tpi provides property management  vacation rental and homeowners association management services to timeshare resorts in the united states  canada and mexico 
on february   we acquired vri  the largest non developer provider of resort and homeowners association management services to the shared ownership industry  determined by number of properties 
as of december   the businesses that comprise our management and rental segment provided management and rental services at over vacation properties  resorts and club locations in north america as well as more limited management services to certain additional properties 
revenue from the management and rental segment is derived principally from fees for hotel  condominium resort  timeshare resort and homeowners association management and rental services 
management fees consist of a base management fee and  in some instances for hotels or condominium resorts  an incentive management fee which is generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits 
service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations  sales and marketing  property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third party providers 
a majority of aston hotel and condominium resort management agreements provide that owners receive either specified percentages of the revenue generated under our management or guaranteed dollar amounts 
in these cases  the operating expenses for the rental operation are paid from the revenue generated by the rentals  the owners are then paid their contractual percentages or amounts  and the management and rental segment either retains the balance if any as its management fee or makes up the deficit 
international operations international revenue increased in compared to and increased in compared to as a percentage of our total revenue  international revenue decreased to in  from in  and from in the decrease in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue is impacted by the recent acquisitions of vri and tpi which operate predominantly in the united states 

table of contents other factors affecting results membership and exchange the consolidation of resort developers driven by bankruptcies and the lack of receivables financing has resulted in a decrease in the flow of new members from point of sale to our exchange networks 
while access to receivables financing has recovered  financing standards for consumers remain higher than those required several years ago 
additionally  a high proportion of sales by developers are to their existing owners  which does not result in new members to the interval network 
our results were negatively affected by a shift in the percentage mix of our membership base from traditional  direct renewal members to corporate members who are renewed directly by the respective developer and tend to have a lower propensity to transact with us 
membership mix as of december  included traditional and corporate members  compared to and  respectively  as of december  consequently  where possible  we structure our corporate membership arrangements to include reservation servicing and or other revenue streams to mitigate the anticipated lower transaction propensity 
management and rental our management and rental segment results are susceptible to variations in economic conditions  particularly in its largest market  hawaii 
according to the hawaii tourism authority  visitor arrivals by air in hawaii increased in compared to the increase in visitors is consistent with aston managed properties in hawaii experiencing increases in occupancy  leading to an overall increase of in revenue per available room revpar in hawaii in compared to the increase in revpar in hawaii was predominantly driven by higher average daily rates and  to a lesser extent  higher occupancy 
as of the latest forecast february  the hawaii department for business  economic development and tourism  forecasts increases of in visitors to hawaii and in visitor expenditures in when compared to business acquisition on february   we acquired vri  the largest non developer provider of resort and homeowners association management services to the shared ownership industry  determined by number of properties 
vri was consolidated into our financial statements as of the acquisition date and the financial effect of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements  however  the year over year comparability was affected as further discussed in our results of operations section 
liquidity on june   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement which provides  among other things  a million revolving credit facility  as further discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the interest rate on the amended and restated credit agreement is based on at our election either libor plus a predetermined margin that ranges from to  or the base rate  as defined  plus a predetermined margin that ranges from to  in each case based on ilg leverage ratio 
on september   we redeemed all of our senior notes at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date  at which time the senior notes were no longer deemed to be outstanding and our obligations under the indenture  as previously supplemented  terminated 
additionally  the extinguishment of our senior notes resulted in a non cash  pre tax loss on extinguishment of debt of million during the third quarter of principally pertaining to the acceleration of the original issue discount and the write off of the related unamortized deferred debt issuance costs 
this non cash 
table of contents charge is presented as a separate line item within other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  outlook throughout  the vacation ownership industry remained in a period of transition that resulted in the bankruptcy  restructuring and consolidation of developers as well as continued modifications to their business models 
we expect additional consolidation and reorganizations within the industry into additionally  we anticipate margin compression and increased competition in our membership and exchange business resulting from developers proprietary clubs 
for the management and rental segment  we expect aston revpar to continue to show year over year improvement as its largest market  hawaii  continues its tourism recovery and benefits from increases in airlift into the island chain  however  increases in airfare may negatively impact visitor arrivals from the mainland and temper growth 
lastly  during the second quarter of  the ownership and debt structure of one of aston largest managed properties was restructured 
this caused aston management agreement for the property to be modified  aston compensation to be reduced and the remaining term to be shortened  with short term renewals at the option of the new property owner 
consequently  during the second and third quarter we assessed the impact of these modifications on our management and rental operating segment to determine whether an interim impairment test of long lived assets and goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets was warranted 
the result of these assessments did not indicate that assets might be impaired and  therefore  an interim impairment test was not warranted at that time 
additionally  as of october   we performed our annual impairment test on our goodwill and other intangible assets  as discussed in note of these consolidated financial statements  and concluded that the likelihood of impairment was below the more likely than not threshold established in the applicable accounting guidance and  therefore  no further steps were warranted 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual outcomes could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note accompanying our consolidated financial statements and should be reviewed in connection with the following discussion 
set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations  based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application 
revenue recognition revenue  net of sales incentives  from membership fees from our membership and exchange segment is deferred and recognized over the terms of the applicable memberships  typically ranging from one to five years  on a straight line basis 
when multiple member benefits and services are provided over the term of the membership  revenue is recognized for each separable deliverable ratably over the membership period  as applicable 
generally  memberships are cancelable and refundable on a pro rata basis  with the exception of our platinum tier  which is non refundable 
direct costs of acquiring members primarily commissions and certain fulfillment costs related to deferred membership revenue are also deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable memberships or benefit period  whichever is shorter 
the recognition of previously deferred 
table of contents revenue and expense is based on estimates derived from an aggregation of member level data 
revenue from exchange and getaway transactions is recognized when confirmation of the transaction is provided as the earnings process is complete 
reservation servicing revenue is recognized when service is performed or on a straight line basis over the applicable service period depending on the specific contractual terms 
all taxable revenue transactions are presented on a net of tax basis 
the management and rental segment revenue is derived principally from fees for hotel  condominium resort  timeshare resort and homeowners association management and rental services 
management fees consist of base management fees  which are either fixed amounts or range from to of adjusted gross lodging revenue  various revenue sharing arrangements with condominium owners based on stated formulas or a percentage of adjusted gross lodging revenue  and incentive management fees for certain hotels and condominium resorts which are generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits 
service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations  sales and marketing  property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third party providers 
service fee revenue is recognized when the service is provided 
in certain instances we arrange services which are provided directly to property owners 
transactions for these services do not impact our consolidated financial statements as they are not included in our results of operations 
additionally  in most cases  we employ on site personnel to provide services such as housekeeping  maintenance and administration to property owners and homeowner associations under our management agreements 
for such services  we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the expenses incurred 
additionally  when we enter into multiple element arrangements  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in these arrangements should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if so  how the contract price should be allocated to each element 
we analyze our contracts upon execution to determine the appropriate revenue recognition accounting treatment 
our determination of whether to recognize revenue for separate deliverables will depend on the terms and specifics of our products and arrangements as well as the nature of changes to our existing products and services  if any 
the allocation of contract revenue to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction or arrangement  but may impact the timing of revenue recognition 
accounting for business combinations in accordance with asc topic  business combinations  when accounting for business combinations we are required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value as of the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets  estimated contingent consideration payments and or pre acquisition contingencies  all of which ultimately affect the fair value of goodwill established as of the acquisition date 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit s expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date and is then subsequently tested for impairment at least annually 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired entity and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in accounting for acquisitions include but are not limited to the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration  which is performed using a probability weighted income approach based upon the forecasted achievement of post acquisition pre determined targets  
table of contents the future expected cash flows from sales of products and services and related contracts and agreements  and discount and long term growth rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of our assumptions  estimates or actual results 
additionally  any change in the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes resulting from events that occur after the acquisition date  such as changes in our estimated fair value of the targets that are expected to be achieved  will be recognized in earnings in the period of the change in estimated fair value 
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets our policy goodwill and other intangible assets are significant components of our consolidated balance sheets 
our policies regarding the valuation of intangible assets affect the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges we may incur 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as consumer spending habits and general economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we review the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of each of our reporting units on an annual basis as of october  or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances 
goodwill is tested for impairment based on either a qualitative assessment or a two step impairment test 
we consider our membership and exchange and management and rental segments to be individual reporting units which are also individual operating segments of ilg 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit s expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date 
during the year  we monitor the actual performance of our reporting units relative to the fair value assumptions used in our annual impairment test  including potential events and changes in circumstance affecting our key estimates and assumptions 
qualitative assessment the qualitative assessment may be elected in any given year pursuant to asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu 
asu amended the testing of goodwill for impairment 
under the revised guidance  entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
the guidance also provides the option to skip the qualitative assessment in any given year and proceed directly with the two step impairment test at our discretion 
our qualitative assessment is performed for the purpose of assessing whether events or circumstances have occurred in the intervening period between the date of our last two step impairment test the baseline valuation and the date of our current annual impairment test which could adversely affect the comparison of our reporting units fair value with its carrying amount 
examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying amount include macro economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity operating 
table of contents environment  industry or overall market conditions  reporting unit specific events such as increasing costs  declining financial performance  or loss of key personnel or contracts  or other events such as pending litigation  access to capital in the credit markets or a sustained decrease in ilg stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers 
if it is determined  as a result of the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we are then required to perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
two step impairment test the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using the average of an income approach and a market comparison approach which utilizes similar companies as the basis for the valuation 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the impairment loss is determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over amounts assigned to its net assets 
the determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other estimates 
fair value measurements are generally determined through the use of valuation techniques that may include a discounted cash flow approach  which reflects our own assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
indefinite lived intangible assets our intangible assets with indefinite lives relate principally to trade names and trademarks 
pursuant to asc  if an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life  it shall not be amortized until its useful life is determined to no longer be indefinite 
accordingly  we evaluate the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
as of december   there have been no changes to the indefinite life determination pertaining to these intangible assets 
in addition  an intangible asset that is not subject to amortization shall be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded 
however  subsequent to the issuance of asu in july  entities testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the likelihood of the indefinite lived intangible asset being impaired is below a more likely than not threshold ie  a likelihood of more than percent  the entity would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset 
annual impairment test as of october   we reviewed the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets of each of our two reporting units 
goodwill assigned to the membership and exchange and management and rental reporting units as of this date was million and million  respectively 
we performed a qualitative assessment on both our reporting units and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and  therefore  a two step impairment test was not necessary 
as of december   we did not identify 
table of contents any triggering events which required an interim impairment test subsequent to our annual impairment test on october  key estimates and assumptions the determination of fair value utilizes an evaluation of historical and forecasted operating results and other key assumptions made by management  including discount rates  utilized in the valuation of certain identifiable assets 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions or in our results of operations or unforeseen negative events could adversely affect either of our reporting units and lead to a revision of the estimates used to calculate fair value 
these key estimates and forecasted operating results may or may not occur or may be revised by management which may require us to recognize impairment losses in the future 
the october  qualitative assessment we performed on our membership and exchange reporting unit considered the substantial passing margin of realized in our october  baseline valuation and the following measures of sensitivity  calculated by holding other variables constant  when comparing our baseline valuation against the events and circumstances specific to the intervening period ending october  the ebitda multiple required to fail step one of the baseline valuation would require a multiple less than half of what was used in the baseline valuation 
the discount rate required to fail step one of the baseline valuation would require using a discount rate more than double the rate used in the baseline valuation 
our long term residual growth rates needed for the baseline valuation to fail step one would require a significant and prolonged period of negative growth given the substantial passing margin 
our qualitative assessment did not lead us to believe any of the above hypothetical sensitivity measures were more likely than not to have occurred in the period between our baseline valuation and our october  testing date 
with respect to the baseline valuation for our membership and exchange reporting unit  the primary examples of key estimates include our discount rate and forecasted sales growth rates 
as previously noted  we used the average of an income approach and a market comparison approach to calculate the fair value of our reporting units in the baseline valuation 
as a measure of sensitivity on the income approach  as of the date of our baseline valuation  a hypothetical change in both our discount and long term growth rates would result in a change of million in the income approach fair value of the reporting unit  or approximately of the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value 
in regards to the market comparison approach  a change in our selected ebitda multiple by would result in a change of approximately million in the membership and exchange reporting unit market comparison approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of the reporting unit fair value over its carrying value 
the october  qualitative assessment we performed on our management and rental reporting unit considered the following measures of sensitivity  calculated by holding other variables constant  when comparing our baseline valuation against the events and circumstances specific to the intervening period ending october  the discount rate required to fail step one of the baseline valuation would require using a discount rate that would be higher than the rate used in the baseline valuation 
an unfavorable change by to our projected long term residual growth rates would be needed for the baseline valuation to fail step one 

table of contents a sustained contraction in our projected ebitda multiple  when compared against the ebitda multiple selected as part of the baseline valuation  would be required to fail step one 
our qualitative assessment did not lead us to believe any of the above hypothetical sensitivity measures were more likely than not to have occurred in the period between our baseline valuation and our october  testing date 
with respect to the baseline valuation for our management and rental reporting unit  the primary examples of key estimates include forecasted available and occupied room nights  average daily rates and long term growth rates 
as a measure of sensitivity on the income approach  as of the date of our baseline valuation  a hypothetical change to all four forecasted key estimates would result in a change of approximately million in our management and rental income approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value 
in regards to the market comparison approach  a change in our selected ebitda multiple by would result in a change of approximately million in the reporting unit market comparison approach fair value  or approximately of the excess of the reporting unit fair value over its carrying value 
the preceding sensitivities for our membership and exchange and management and rental reporting units exclude the impact of our february  acquisition of vri  which we qualitatively assessed separately and concluded the likelihood of vri fair value failing to exceed its carrying amount was not above the more likely than not threshold 
key estimates and assumptions for both our reporting units can be impacted by certain potential events and changes in circumstances  as follows events and trends in the vacation ownership  vacation rental and travel industries that could adversely affect consumers travel to and vacation in certain destinations and regions in which vacation rental and managed properties are located  including events such as declines in discretionary spending levels during general economic downturns 
inclement weather and or natural disasters 
travel health concerns 
concerns related to terrorism  enhanced travel security measures and or geographical conflicts 
additionally  key estimates and assumptions for both our reporting units can be impacted by certain potential events and changes in circumstances specific to each reporting unit  such as membership and exchange a downturn or a weakening of the economy may cause decreased demand for purchases of vacation ownership interests  may increase default rates among current owners and may increase refund requests from our members 
lack of available financing for vacation property developers and consumers or the potential insolvency or consolidation of developers could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow our exchange network membership which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to maintain and renew contractual relationships with vacation ownership developers that provide new members and supply of resort accommodations for use in exchanges or getaways 
our ability to motivate members to renew their existing memberships and or otherwise engage in transactions 

table of contents management and rental a downturn or a weakening of the economy may cause decreased demand for vacation rentals 
the failure to maintain existing hotel  condominium resort and timeshare resort management and or rental services arrangements with vacation property owners homeowners associations  and or insolvency of several properties managed by or marketed by the management and rental segment  particularly managed hotels 
a significant decrease in the supply of available vacation rental accommodations due to ongoing property renovations 
inability of our managed homeowners associations to levy and collect sufficient maintenance fees to cover the costs to operate and maintain the resort properties  such properties may be forced to close or file bankruptcy and may terminate our management 
recoverability of long lived assets our policy we review the carrying value of all long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset asset group may be impaired 
in accordance with guidance included within asc topic  property  plant and equipment  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset asset group to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset asset group 
an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
when estimating future cash flows  we consider only the future cash flows that were directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset group  our own assumptions about our use of the asset group and all available evidence when estimating future cash flows  potential events and changes in circumstance affecting our key estimates and assumptions  the existing service potential of the asset asset group at the date tested 
if an asset asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset asset group exceeds its fair value 
when determining the fair value of the asset asset group  we consider the highest and best use of the assets from a market participant perspective 
the fair value measurement is generally determined through the use of independent third party appraisals or an expected present value technique  both of which may include a discounted cash flow approach  which reflects our own assumptions of what market participants would utilize to price the asset asset group 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
assets to be abandoned  or from which no further benefit is expected  are written down to zero at the time that the determination is made and the assets are removed entirely from service 
recoverability test the last recoverability test performed was as of march  on an asset group within our management and rental reporting unit as a consequence of that reporting unit failing step one of the two step process for testing goodwill for impairment 
the resulting recoverability test concluded the asset group was not considered to be impaired 
from that date through december   we have 
table of contents not identified events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group may be impaired  accordingly  a recoverability test has not been warranted 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is accounted for under asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
compensation cost for stock awards is measured at fair value on date of grant and recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on that date  except for rsus subject to relative total shareholder return performance criteria  which the fair value is based on a monte carlo simulation analysis as further discussed in note accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
we grant awards subject to graded vesting ie portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period or to cliff vesting ie all awards vest at the end of the vesting period 
certain rsus  in addition  are subject to attaining specific performance criteria 
for rsus to be settled in stock  the accounting charge is measured at the grant date fair value and expensed as non cash compensation over the vesting term using the straight line basis for service only awards and the accelerated basis for performance based awards with graded vesting 
for certain cliff vesting awards with performance criteria  we also use anticipated future results in determining the fair value of the award 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line recognition method 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income is reduced by estimated forfeitures  as the amount recorded is based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
the expense associated with rsu awards to be settled in cash is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and expensed ratably over the vesting term  recording a liability subject to mark to market adjustments for changes in the price of the respective common stock as compensation expense 
stock based compensation is recorded within the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the employee related compensation of the award recipient  as disclosed in tabular format in note accompanying our consolidated financial statements 
management must make certain estimates and assumptions regarding stock awards that will ultimately vest  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
the forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods for any changes to the estimated forfeiture rate from that previously estimated 
for any vesting tranche of an award  the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized is equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award tranche that is actually vested at that date 
actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
as of december   ilg had approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  related to all equity based awards  which is currently expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
of the million of unrecognized compensation cost  relates to an employee class group comprised of certain key employees for which we do not expect rsus to be forfeited 
for awards in which we expect forfeitures to occur  a change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have an impact of less than  to our unrecognized compensation cost as of december  
table of contents income taxes accounting for our income taxes requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes 
pursuant to asc topic income taxes asc  we adopted a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the completion of a tax audit  expiration of the applicable statute of limitations  the refinement of an estimate  and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made

the change in the corporate tax rate initially negatively impacts income tax expense as the future benefit expected to be realized from our uk net deferred tax assets decreases  however  going forward  the lower corporate tax rate will decrease income tax expense and favorably impact our effective tax rate

additional tax provisions would be required should such earnings be repatriated to the us cash generated by operations is used as our primary source of liquidity 
additionally  we are also exposed to risks associated with the repatriation of cash from certain of our foreign operations to the united states where currency restrictions exist  such as venezuela and argentina  which limit our ability to immediately access cash through repatriations 
these currency restrictions had no impact on our overall liquidity during and  as of december   the respective cash balances were immaterial to our overall cash on hand 
we believe that our cash on hand along with our anticipated operating future cash flows and availability under our million revolving credit facility  which may be increased to up to million subject to certain conditions  are sufficient to fund our operating needs  quarterly cash dividend  capital expenditures  development and expansion of our operations  debt service  investments and other commitments and contingencies for at least the next twelve months

in these cases  the operating expenses for the rental operations are paid from the revenue generated by the rentals  the owners are then paid their contractual percentages  and the management and rental segment either retains the balance if any as its management fee or makes up the deficit

free cash flow cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
our presentation of above mentioned non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
we believe these measures are useful to investors because they represent the consolidated operating results from our segments  excluding the effects of any non cash expenses 
we also believe these non gaap financial measures improve the transparency of our disclosures  provide a meaningful presentation of our results from our business operations  excluding the impact of certain items not related to our core business operations and improve the period to period comparability of results from business operations 
these non gaap measures have 
table of contents certain limitations in that they do not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our statement of operations  including non cash compensation for adjusted ebitda 
we endeavor to compensate for the limitations of these non gaap measures presented by also providing the comparable gaap measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items  including quantifying such items  to derive the non gaap measure 
we report these non gaap measures as supplemental measures to results reported pursuant to gaap 
these measures are among the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses  on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated 
we believe that investors should have access to the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results 
these non gaap measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results 
we provide and encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the gaap and non gaap measures which are discussed below 
pro forma results we will only present ebitda and or adjusted ebitda on a pro forma basis if we view a particular transaction as significant in size or transformational in nature 
for the periods presented in this report  there are no transactions that we have included on a pro forma basis 
non cash expenses that are excluded from ilg non gaap measures as applicable amortization expense of intangibles is a non cash expense relating primarily to acquisitions 
at the time of an acquisition  the intangible assets of the acquired company  such as customer relationships  purchase agreements and resort management agreements are valued and amortized over their estimated lives 
we believe that since intangibles represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition  they were part of transaction costs 
depreciation expense is a non cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is recorded on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives 
non cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants  including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions  of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock options 
these expenses are not paid in cash  and we will include the related shares in our future calculations of diluted shares of stock outstanding 
upon vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units and the exercise of certain stock options  the awards will be settled  at our discretion  on a net basis  with us remitting the required tax withholding amount from our current funds 
goodwill and asset impairments are non cash expenses relating to adjustments to goodwill and long lived assets whereby the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the related assets  and are infrequent in nature 
other non operating income and expense consists principally of foreign currency translations of cash held in certain countries in currencies  principally us dollars  other than their functional currency  in addition to any gains or losses on extinguishment of debt

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in the united kingdom and other european union markets 
our foreign currency risk primarily relates to our investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar 
this exposure is mitigated as we have generally reinvested profits in our international operations 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 

table of contents in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to transactions and or assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
historically  we have not hedged currency risks 
however  our foreign currency exposure related to eu vat liabilities denominated in euros is largely offset by euro denominated cash balances 
furthermore  in an effort to mitigate economic risk  we hold us dollars in certain subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than the us dollar 
operating foreign currency exchange attributable to foreign currency remeasurements of operating assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency was inconsequential for all periods presented 
non operating foreign exchange included net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and a net gain of million for the year ended december   attributable to cash held in certain countries in currencies other than their functional currency 
the unfavorable fluctuation for the year ended december  was principally driven by us dollar positions held at december  affected by the weaker dollar compared to the mexican peso and colombian peso 
the favorable fluctuation for the year ended december  was principally driven by us dollar positions held at december  affected by the stronger dollar compared to the mexican peso  partly offset by a strengthening of the colombian peso against the us dollar 
the unfavorable fluctuations for were principally driven by us dollar positions held at december  affected by the shift in the value of the dollar primarily to the british pound  mexican peso  and colombian peso 
the venezuelan bolivar cash held impacted our foreign exchange net loss in given our change to the us dollar as the functional currency for that entity due to highly inflationary accounting  effective that year  partially offset by a gain realized in june due to our change from the parallel market rate to the sitme rate for remeasurement purposes 
in april  we transferred the majority of the cash from our venezuelan entity bolivar denominated bank account in venezuela to our venezuelan entity us dollar denominated bank account in the us and consequently reduced the exposure going forward 
effective in february  the venezuelan government eliminated the sitme market and concurrently devalued their currency 
we do not anticipate this currency devaluation to have more than a negligible impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our operations in international markets are exposed to potentially volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on us is often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing  operating and hedging strategies 
a hypothetical weakening strengthening in foreign exchange rates to the us dollar for the year ended december  would result in an approximate change to revenue of million 
there have been no material quantitative changes in market risk exposures since december  interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through borrowings under our june  amended credit agreement which bears interest at variable rates 
the interest rate on the amended credit agreement is based on at our election either libor plus a predetermined margin that ranges from to  or the base rate as defined in the amended credit agreement plus a predetermined margin that ranges from to  in each case based on ilg leverage ratio 
as of december   the applicable margin was per annum for libor revolving loans and per annum for base rate loans 
at december   we had at least million outstanding for days under our revolving credit facility subsequent to the redemption of our senior notes on september   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to interest expense of million for the year pertaining to our amended credit agreement 
while we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure  this risk is somewhat mitigated by variable interest rates earned on our cash balances
