significant accounting policies and estimates our analysis and discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
we have chosen accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in a consistent 
table of contents manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of current and forecasted economic conditions 
our accounting policies are stated in note b to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our results of operations and the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues in our patient care segment are derived from the sale of o p devices and the maintenance and repair of existing devices and are recorded net of all known contractual adjustments and discounts 
the sale of o p devices includes the design  fabrication  assembly  fitting and delivery of a wide range of braces  limbs and other devices 
revenues from the sale of these devices are recorded when i acceptance by and delivery to the patient has occurred  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and there are no further obligations to the patient  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from maintenance and repairs are recognized when the service is provided 
revenues on the sale of o p devices to customers by the distribution segment are recorded upon the shipment of products  in accordance with the terms of the invoice  net of merchandise returns 
discounted sales are recorded at net realizable value 
revenues in our therapeutic solutions are primarily derived from leasing rehabilitation technology combined with clinical therapy programs and education and training 
the revenue is recorded on a monthly basis according to terms of the contracts with our customers 
certain accounts receivable may be uncollectible  even if properly pre authorized and billed 
regardless of the balance  accounts receivable amounts are periodically evaluated to assess collectability 
in addition to the actual bad debt expense recognized during collection activities  we estimate the amount of potential bad debt expense that may occur in the future 
this estimate is based upon our historical experience as well as a review of our receivable balances 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate cash collections  accounts receivable balances and write off activity to assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
additionally  a company wide evaluation of collectability of receivable balances older than days is performed at least semi annually  the results of which are used in the next allowance analysis 
in these detailed reviews  the account net realizable value is estimated after considering the customer payment history  past efforts to collect on the balance and the outstanding balance  and a specific reserve is recorded if needed 
from time to time  we may outsource the collection of such accounts to collection agencies after internal collection efforts are exhausted 
in cases where valid accounts receivable cannot be collected  the uncollectible account is written off to bad debt expense 
the following represents the composition of our accounts receivable balance by payor december  days days over days total in thousands patient care commercial insurance private pay medicaid medicare va distribution therapeutic solutions trade accounts receivable 
table of contents december  days days over days total in thousands patient care commercial insurance private pay medicaid medicare va distribution therapeutic solutions trade accounts receivable inventories inventories in the patient care segment consisting principally of raw materials and work in process  which amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively  are valued based on the gross profit method which approximates lower of cost or market using the first in first out method 
we apply the gross profit method on a patient care clinic basis in this segment inventory to determine ending inventory at the end of each interim period except on october st  which is the date of our physical inventory 
the annual physical inventory for this segment values the inventory at lower of cost or market using the first in first out method and includes work in process consisting of materials  labor and overhead which is valued based on established standards for the stage of completion of each custom order 
adjustments to reconcile the physical inventory to our books are treated as changes in accounting estimates and are recorded in the fourth quarter 
we recorded fourth quarter adjustments of a decrease of million  an increase of million and a decrease of million to inventory as of october   and  respectively 
the october st inventory is subsequently adjusted during interim periods to apply the gross profit method described above 
inventories in the distribution and therapeutic solutions segments consist principally of finished goods which are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method for all reporting periods and are valued based on perpetual records 
fair value the company follows the authoritative guidance for financial assets and liabilities  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
the authoritative guidance requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy by which these assets and liabilities must be categorized  based on significant levels of inputs as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets accessible by the company level inputs that are observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified as level level inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace and significant to the valuation the determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
investments prior to december  the company investments consisted of two auction rate securities ars totaling million of par value  million was collateralized by indiana secondary market municipal bond indiana ars  and million was collateralized 
table of contents by primus financial products subordinated deferrable interest notes primus ars 
ars are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates which generally occur every days and are linked to libor 
at the reset date  investors can attempt to sell via auction or continue to hold the securities at par 
these securities were accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance for investments in debt and equity securities and were reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
during  an other than temporary impairment otti credit loss of million was identified and recognized during the year ended december  this credit loss reduced the amortized cost basis on the primus ars to million as of december  in may  the company sold its investment in the primus ars for million 
on july   the company exercised its right to put the indiana ars back to ubs at par value of million 
the million proceeds were received on july  as part of the settlement  the company closed out a million line of credit with ubs that the company obtained as part of the buyback agreement originally executed in november  with net cash proceeds of approximately million 
interest rate swaps prior to december  we utilized interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
on december   we were required to terminate the interest rate swaps due to refinancing of the credit facilities 
the company incurred a loss of million  which was recorded in loss gain from interest rate swap on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to net identifiable assets of purchased businesses 
we assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter  or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the reporting units may not be recoverable 
the company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the company determines that a two step impairment test is necessary or more efficient than a qualitative approach  it measures the fair value of the company reporting units using a combination of income  market and cost approaches 
any impairment would be recognized by a charge to operating results and a reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
as of october   there were no indicators of impairment as the fair value of the reporting units is substantially in excess of the carrying value of the underlying assets 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income loss for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition  therefore  we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this measurement step is inherently 
table of contents complex and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  expirations of statutes of limitation  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  it could have a material effect on the income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax 
we believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
supplemental executive retirement plan benefit costs and liabilities balances are calculated based on certain assumptions including benefits earned  discount rates  interest costs  mortality rates and other factors 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  affecting the recorded obligation and expense in future periods 
the following assumptions were used in the calculation of the net benefit cost and obligation at december discount rate average rate of increase in compensation we believe the assumptions used are appropriate 
however  changes in assumptions or differences in actual experience may affect our benefit obligation and future expenses 
recently issued accounting guidance in july  the fasb issued asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  an amendment to fasb asc topic the update provides an entity with the option to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
after assessing the qualitative factors  if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test 
the asu is effective for the company for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption was permitted 
the company did not early adopt the provisions of this asu  however  the company does not expect the impact of adopting this asu to be material to the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  an amendment to fasb asc topic the update requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures 
table of contents that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this asu is effective prospectively for the company fiscal years  and interim periods within those years beginning after december  the company will comply with the disclosure requirements of this asu for the quarter ending march  the company does not expect the impact of adopting this asu to be material to the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows
