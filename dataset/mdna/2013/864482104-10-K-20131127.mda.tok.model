item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in item a of this annual report 
product costs and supply the level of profitability in the retail propane  fuel oil  natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of our products  particularly propane  fuel oil and natural gas  is subject to volatility as a result of supply and demand dynamics or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
we attempt to reduce price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  fuel oil  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
in addition  periods of sustained higher commodity prices can lead to customer conservation  resulting in reduced demand for our product 
seasonality the retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses  as well as the natural gas marketing business  are seasonal because these fuels are primarily used for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
the fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between october and march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season 
we expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
to the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our common units in the fourth quarter and following fiscal year first quarter 
weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products  in particular propane  fuel oil and natural gas  for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane  fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source 
accordingly  the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures  will tend to result in reduced propane  fuel oil and natural gas consumption  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption 

table of contents hedging and risk management activities we engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply 
we enter into propane forward  options and swap agreements with third parties  and use futures and options contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex to purchase and sell propane  fuel oil and crude oil at fixed prices in the future 
the majority of the futures  forward and options agreements are used to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventory  as well as  in certain instances  forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil 
in addition  we sell propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices  and enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts 
forward contracts are generally settled physically at the expiration of the contract whereas futures  options and swap contracts are generally settled in cash at the expiration of the contract 
although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with priced physical inventory and forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
risk management activities are monitored by an internal commodity risk management committee  made up of five members of management and reporting to our audit committee  through enforcement of our hedging and risk management policy 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefit plans  self insurance and litigation reserves  environmental reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of supervisors 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting estimates allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts  as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write offs 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
as a result of our large customer base  which is comprised of more than million customers  no individual customer account is material 
therefore  while some variation to actual results occurs  historically such variability has not been material 
schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts  provides a summary of the changes in our allowances for doubtful accounts during the period 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate used to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the expected cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense 
with other assumptions held constant  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have an immaterial impact on net pension and postretirement benefit costs 
see liquidity and capital resources pension plan assets and obligations below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits 
self insurance reserves 
our accrued self insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each unasserted claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data 
our self insurance provisions are susceptible to change to the extent that actual claims development differs from historical claims development 
we maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible  claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers 
for the portion of our estimated self insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles  we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by the insurance companies 
historically  we have not experienced significant variability in our actuarial estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
accrued insurance provisions for reported claims are reviewed at least quarterly  and our assessment of whether a loss is probable and or reasonably estimable is updated as necessary 
due to the inherently uncertain nature of  in particular  product liability claims  the ultimate loss may differ materially from our estimates 
however  because of the nature of our insurance arrangements  those material variations historically have not  nor are they expected in the future to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
loss contingencies 
in the normal course of business  we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we record a liability for such matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
the liability includes probable and estimable legal costs to the point in the legal matter where we believe a conclusion to the matter will be reached 
when only a range of possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
fair values of acquired assets and liabilities 
from time to time  we enter into material business combinations 
in accordance with accounting guidance associated with business combinations  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date 
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal 
estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment 
estimates most commonly impact property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  including goodwill 
generally  we have  if necessary  up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize our estimates of acquisition date fair values 
results of operations and financial condition for comparative purposes  fiscal included weeks of operations compared to weeks in fiscal in addition  the variances in year over year results were primarily attributable to the inclusion of inergy propane  acquired on august   as well as improvements in the operating performance in our legacy operations 
net income for fiscal amounted to million  or per common unit  compared to million  or per common unit  in fiscal earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for fiscal amounted to million  compared to million for fiscal net income and ebitda for fiscal included i million in expenses related to the ongoing integration of inergy propane  ii million in charges related to our voluntary withdrawal from multi employer pension plans covering certain employees acquired in the inergy propane acquisition  and iii a loss on debt extinguishment of million 
net income and ebitda for fiscal included i million in acquisition related costs associated with the inergy propane acquisition  ii a charge of million associated with a legal settlement  iii a million non cash charge from a loss on disposal of an asset in our natural gas and electricity business  and iv a loss on debt extinguishment of million 
excluding the effects of these charges  as well as the unrealized non cash mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments in both years  adjusted ebitda as defined and reconciled below amounted to million for fiscal  compared to adjusted ebitda of million in fiscal 
table of contents retail propane gallons sold for fiscal increased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in fiscal sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels also increased  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
the increase in volumes sold was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the inergy propane operations for a full year  as well as increases in our legacy operations resulting from average temperatures that were closer to normal compared to the prior year s near record warm temperatures 
according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  average temperatures as measured by heating degree days across all of our service territories during fiscal were warmer than normal and characterized by unseasonably warm temperatures during the most critical months of the fiscal heating season  followed by colder than normal temperatures late in the heating season 
in fiscal  average temperatures across our service territories were warmer than normal 
during fiscal  we made notable progress in our integration efforts and in executing our strategic financing initiatives  all of which have better positioned us operationally and financially to continue to pursue further growth opportunities 
to highlight a few key accomplishments for fiscal key regional management positions were put in place to oversee the combined operations prior to the start of the heating season  regular and ongoing communication was established with the entire inergy propane customer base  as well as the combined employee base in order to manage change  we defined our local operating footprint and identified management teams across the entire platform  substantial progress was made on our retail system conversions that support our new operating footprint  and we reduced our overall leverage by million through a combination of net proceeds from a successful issuance of common units  as well as cash on hand 
despite the increased size of our business and the increased working capital needs  for the seventh consecutive year we continued to fund all of our working capital requirements from on hand cash without the need to borrow under our revolving credit facility and ended the fiscal year with million of cash 
additionally  as previously reported  we took steps to further strengthen our balance sheet by redeeming million of debt in fiscal with a combination of proceeds from a successful equity offering and cash on hand 
as we look ahead to fiscal  our anticipated cash requirements include i maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million  ii approximately million of interest and income tax payments  and iii approximately million of distributions to unitholders  assuming distributions at the current annualized rate of per common unit 
based on our current cash position  availability under the revolving credit facility unused borrowing capacity of million at september  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent increase increase revenues propane fuel oil and refined fuels natural gas and electricity all other total revenues total revenues increased million  or  to  million for fiscal compared to  million for the prior year due to higher volumes sold  offset to an extent by lower average propane  fuel oil and refined fuels and natural gas selling prices 
the increase in sales volumes was primarily due to the addition of the inergy propane business  as well as increases in our legacy operations resulting from colder average temperatures 
as discussed above  average temperatures as measured in heating degree days across all of our service territories for fiscal were warmer than normal  compared to warmer than normal for the prior year 
revenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of  million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to million for the prior year  primarily due to higher volumes sold  partially offset by lower average selling prices associated with lower product costs 
retail propane gallons sold in fiscal increased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year  primarily as a result of the addition of inergy propane  as well as increases in our legacy operations resulting from colder average temperatures 
higher retail propane volumes sold resulted in an increase in revenues of million for fiscal compared to the prior year 
average propane selling prices for fiscal decreased compared to the prior year due to lower wholesale product costs  resulting in a million decrease in revenues year over year 
included within the propane segment are revenues from risk management activities and other propane activities of million for fiscal  which increased million compared to the prior year as higher volumes from other propane activities were substantially offset by lower volumes from wholesale and risk management activities 
revenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of million for fiscal increased million  or  from million for the prior year  primarily due to higher volumes sold  partially offset by lower average selling prices 
fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal increased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year  primarily as a result of the addition of inergy propane  as well as increases in our legacy operations resulting from colder average temperatures 
higher fuel oil and refined fuels volumes sold resulted in an increase in revenues of million for fiscal compared to the prior year 
average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment in fiscal decreased compared to the prior year  resulting in a million decrease in revenues year over year 
revenues in our natural gas and electricity segment increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year as a result of higher natural gas volumes sold  and higher electricity average selling prices 
the increase in volumes sold was primarily attributable to the more favorable weather pattern in fiscal  compared to the unseasonably warm weather in the prior year 

table of contents cost of products sold dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent increase increase cost of products sold propane fuel oil and refined fuels natural gas and electricity all other total cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues the cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane  fuel oil and refined fuels  natural gas and electricity sold  including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers 
cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products 
unrealized non cash gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded within cost of products sold 
cost of products sold excludes depreciation and amortization  these amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations 
average posted prices for propane for fiscal were lower than the prior year  and fuel oil prices were essentially flat year over year 
total cost of products sold increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year due to higher volumes sold  partially offset by lower average propane product costs 
the net change in the fair value of derivative instruments during the period resulted in unrealized non cash losses of million and unrealized non cash gains of million reported in cost of products sold in fiscal and  respectively  resulting in an increase of million in cost of products sold in fiscal compared to the prior year  all of which was reported in the propane segment 
cost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
higher retail propane volumes sold resulted in an increase of million in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the impact of the increase in volumes sold was partially offset by lower average propane costs  which resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold year over year 
cost of products sold from other propane activities decreased million in fiscal compared to the prior year  primarily due to lower sales from wholesale and risk management activities 
cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to higher fuel oil and refined fuels volumes sold 
cost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to the prior year  primarily due to higher natural gas volumes sold  and higher electricity product costs 
total cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues decreased percentage points to in fiscal from in the prior year  primarily due to the decline in propane wholesale product costs outpacing the decline in propane average selling prices 
in addition  colder average temperatures and the inclusion of inergy propane operations resulted in a higher concentration of residential volumes sold in fiscal compared to the prior year  which had a favorable impact on overall gross margins 

table of contents operating expenses dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent increase increase operating expenses as a percent of total revenues all costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
these operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel  costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet  overhead and other costs of our purchasing  training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of operating our customer service centers 
operating expenses of million for fiscal increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to the addition of inergy propane  offset to an extent by lower payroll and benefit related expenses in our legacy operations resulting from operating efficiencies 
in addition  operating expenses for fiscal included a million charge related to our voluntary partial withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan and full withdrawal from four multi employer pension plans  and a charge of million primarily for severance costs  both charges were associated with the integration of the inergy propane operations 
these charges were excluded from our calculation of adjusted ebitda below 
as a result of the progress on our efforts to integrate the operations of inergy propane  including the initial process of blending geographic territories and systems  which commenced at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal  we have realized certain synergies in the combined operating expenses of inergy propane and our legacy operations 
general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent increase increase general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues all costs of our back office support functions  including compensation and benefits for executives and other support functions  as well as other costs and expenses to maintain finance and accounting  treasury  legal  human resources  corporate development and the information systems functions are reported within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations

interest expense  net dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal percent increase increase interest expense  net as a percent of total revenues net interest expense of million for fiscal increased million compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due october  and million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due august  in connection with the inergy propane acquisition on august  see liquidity and capital resources below for additional discussion 
loss on debt extinguishment on august   we repurchased  pursuant to an optional redemption  million of our senior notes due august  using net proceeds from our may public offering and net proceeds from the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option to purchase additional common units 
in addition  on august   we repurchased million of our senior notes in a private transaction using cash on hand 
in connection with these repurchases  which totaled million in aggregate principal amount  we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of million consisting of million for the repurchase premium and related fees  as well as the write off of million and million in unamortized debt origination costs and unamortized premium  respectively 
during fiscal  in connection with the execution of the amendment of our credit agreement on january   we recognized a non cash charge of million to write off a portion of unamortized debt origination costs associated with the credit agreement during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  in connection with the repayment  on august   of borrowings under our day facility defined below which was used as short term financing to fund a portion of the inergy propane acquisition  we recognized a non cash charge of million to write off unamortized debt origination costs associated with the day facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for additional discussion on the amendment to the credit agreement and other financing activities

table of contents credit agreement our operating partnership has a credit agreement  as amended on january  and august  the amended credit agreement that provides for a five year million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  of which million was outstanding as of september  and september  borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our operating partnership has the right to prepay any borrowings under the revolving credit facility  in whole or in part  without penalty at any time prior to maturity 
the amendment to the credit agreement on january  amended the previous credit agreement to  among other things  extend the maturity date from june  to january   reduce the borrowing rate and commitment fees  and amend certain affirmative and negative covenants 
as of january   our operating partnership had borrowings of million outstanding under the revolving credit facility of the previous credit agreement  and rolled those borrowings into the revolving credit facility of the amended credit agreement 
also  at such time  our operating partnership had letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility of the previous credit agreement primarily in support of retention levels under its self insurance programs  all of which have been rolled into the revolving credit facility of the amended credit agreement 
on august   our operating partnership executed an amendment to the amended credit agreement to  among other things  provide for i a million senior secured day facility and ii an increase in our revolving credit facility under the amended credit agreement from million to million 
on the acquisition date  our operating partnership drew million on the day facility  which was used to fund a portion of the inergy propane acquisition  including costs and expenses related to the acquisition 
we repaid the million of borrowings under the day facility on august  with the net proceeds from the public issuance of common units on august  the amendment to the amended credit agreement on august  also amended certain restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to our operating partnership and to us  as well as certain financial covenants  including a requiring our consolidated interest coverage ratio  as defined in the amendment  to be not less than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  b prohibiting the total consolidated leverage ratio  as defined in the amendment  of the partnership from being greater than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio increases over time  and commencing with the third quarter of fiscal  such minimum ratio will be to the maximum consolidated leverage ratio decreases over time  as well as upon the occurrence of certain events such as the issuance of common units where the net proceeds from the issuance exceed certain thresholds 
commencing with the second quarter of fiscal  such maximum ratio will be to or to during an acquisition period as defined in the amendment as a result of the issuance of common units in august as of september  the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and maximum consolidated leverage ratio was to and to  respectively 
we act as a guarantor with respect to the obligations of our operating partnership under the amended credit agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth therein 
the obligations under the amended credit agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of the personal property of the partnership  the operating partnership and their subsidiaries  as well as mortgages on certain real property 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the amended credit agreement bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon  at the operating partnership s option  libor plus the applicable margin or the base rate  defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus of  the agent bank s prime rate  or libor plus  plus in each case the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent upon the partnership s ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
as of september   the interest rate for the revolving credit facility was approximately 
the interest rate and the applicable margin will be reset at the end of each calendar quarter 

table of contents in connection with the previous revolving credit facility  the operating partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  an effective date of march  and termination date of june  under the interest rate swap agreement  the operating partnership paid a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on the notional principal amount outstanding  effectively fixing the libor portion of the interest rate at 
in return  the issuing lender paid to the operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 
the interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge 
in connection with the amended credit agreement  our operating partnership entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  and effective date of june  and a termination date of january  under this forward starting interest rate swap agreement  our operating partnership will pay a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on the notional principal amount outstanding  and the issuing lender will pay our operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 
the forward starting interest rate swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
as of september   our operating partnership had standby letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of million which expire periodically through april  therefore  as of september  we had available borrowing capacity of million under the revolving credit facility 
the amended credit agreement and the senior notes both contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership and the partnership  respectively  including i restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and ii restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
under the amended credit agreement and the indentures governing the senior notes  the operating partnership and the partnership are generally permitted to make cash distributions equal to available cash  as defined  as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter  if no event of default exists or would exist upon making such distributions  and with respect to the indentures governing the senior notes  our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  is greater than to we and our operating partnership were in compliance with all covenants and terms of the senior notes and the amended credit agreement as of september  debt origination costs representing the costs incurred in connection with the placement of  and the subsequent amendment to  long term borrowings are capitalized within other assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective debt agreements 
during fiscal  we recognized charges of million to write off unamortized debt origination costs associated with the repurchase of our senior notes 
during fiscal  we capitalized million and million for costs incurred in connection with issuance of new senior notes and the amendments to our amended credit agreement  respectively 
we recognized charges of million to write off unamortized debt origination costs associated with the amendment to our amended credit agreement on january  and the repayment of borrowings under our day facility 
other assets at september  and september  include debt origination costs with a net carrying amount of million and million  respectively 
the aggregate amounts of long term debt maturities subsequent to september  are as follows fiscal through fiscal  fiscal million  fiscal million  and thereafter million 
partnership distributions we are required to make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  as amended  no more than days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  generally means all cash on hand at the end of the respective fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the board of supervisors in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements 
these reserves are retained for the proper conduct of our business  the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters 
the board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 
on october   we announced that our board of supervisors had declared a quarterly distribution of per common unit for the three months ended september  this quarterly distribution rate equates to an annualized rate of per common unit  which represents a growth rate of when compared to the annualized rate of per common unit as of the end of fiscal year the distribution was paid on november  to common unitholders of record as of november  
table of contents pension plan assets and obligations we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was originally designed to cover all eligible employees of the partnership who met certain requirements as to age and length of service 
effective january   we amended the defined benefit pension plan to provide benefits under a cash balance formula as compared to a final average pay formula which was in effect prior to january  our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective january  and  in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in our benefit obligations  effective january   all future service credits were eliminated 
therefore  eligible participants will receive interest credits only toward their ultimate defined benefit under the defined benefit pension plan 
there were no minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal  or as of september  and september  the plan s projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million and million  respectively 
as a result  the net liability recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the defined benefit pension plan decreased by million during fiscal  which was primarily attributable to a decrease in the present value of the benefit obligation due to a general increase in market interest rates  partially offset by a decline in the value of plan assets as a result of investment losses during fiscal as discussed below  plan assets are largely invested in fixed income securities and  as such  an increase in market interest rates will generally result in negative returns on plan assets 
our investment policies and strategies  as set forth in the investment management policy and guidelines  are monitored by a benefits committee comprised of five members of management 
the benefits committee employs a liability driven investment strategy  which seeks to increase the correlation of the plan s assets and liabilities to reduce the volatility of the plan s funded status 
the execution of this strategy has resulted in an asset allocation that is largely comprised of fixed income securities 
a liability driven investment strategy is intended to reduce investment risk and  over the long term  generate returns on plan assets that largely fund the annual interest on the accumulated benefit obligation 
however  as we experienced in fiscal  significant declines in interest rates relevant to our benefit obligations  or poor performance in the broader capital markets in which our plan assets are invested  could have an adverse impact on the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan 
for purposes of measuring the projected benefit obligation as of september  and september   we used a discount rate of and  respectively  reflecting current market rates for debt obligations of a similar duration to our pension obligations 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the amount of the pension benefit obligation settled through lump sum payments did not exceed the settlement threshold combined service and interest costs of net periodic pension cost  therefore  a settlement charge was not required to be recognized in either of those fiscal years 
we also provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
partnership employees who were hired prior to july and retired prior to march are eligible for health care benefits if they reached a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
partnership employees hired prior to july are eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits if they reach a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
effective january   we terminated our postretirement health care benefit plan for all eligible employees retiring after march  all active and eligible employees who were to receive health care benefits under the postretirement plan subsequent to march  were provided an increase to their accumulated benefits under the defined benefit pension plan 
our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded 
effective january   we changed our postretirement health care plan from a self insured program to one that is fully insured under which we pay a portion of the insurance premium on behalf of the eligible participants

c these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet and primarily include payments for postretirement and long term incentive benefits 
additionally  we have standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  in support of retention levels under our casualty insurance programs and certain lease obligations  which expire periodically through april  operating leases we lease certain property  plant and equipment for various periods under noncancelable operating leases  including of our vehicle fleet  approximately of our customer service centers and portions of our information systems equipment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are presented in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees certain of our operating leases  primarily those for transportation equipment with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal  contain residual value guarantee provisions 
under those provisions  we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount upon completion of the lease period  or we will pay the lessor the difference between fair value and the guaranteed amount 
although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  is approximately million 
the fair value of residual value guarantees for outstanding operating leases was de minimis as of september  and september  
table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu regarding disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
the new guidance requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the amendments  further clarified with asu  will enhance disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in accordance with other us gaap or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement  irrespective of whether or not they are offset in the balance sheet 
the new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods  which will be our first quarter of its fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our future disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued an asu to establish the effective date for the requirement to present components of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income either parenthetically on the face of the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements asu 
the guidance is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those annual periods  which will be the first quarter of our fiscal year 
the adoption of asu will not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
in addition  to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to ensure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
in certain instances  and when market conditions are favorable  we are able to purchase product under our supply arrangements at a discount to the market 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
we attempt to reduce commodity price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
the level of priced  physical product maintained in storage facilities and at our customer service centers for immediate sale to our customers will vary depending on several factors  including  but not limited to  price  supply and demand dynamics for a given time of the year 
typically  our on hand priced position does not exceed more than four to eight weeks of our supply needs  depending on the time of the year 
in the course of normal operations  we routinely enter into contracts such as forward priced physical contracts for the purchase or sale of propane and fuel oil that  under accounting rules for derivative instruments and hedging activities  qualify for and are designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts 
such contracts are exempted from fair value accounting and are accounted for at the time product is purchased or sold under the related contract 
under our hedging and risk management strategies  we enter into a combination of exchange traded futures and options contracts and  in certain instances  over the counter options and swap contracts collectively  derivative instruments to manage the price risk associated with physical product and with future purchases of the commodities used in our operations  principally propane and fuel oil  as well as to ensure the availability of product during periods of high demand 
in addition  the partnership sells propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices  and enters into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
futures and swap contracts require that we sell or acquire propane or fuel oil at a fixed price for delivery at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane or fuel oil at a specified price during a specified time period 
however  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then market price and the fixed contract price or option exercise price 
to the extent that we utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risk and commodity prices move adversely in relation to the contracts  we could suffer losses on those derivative instruments when settled 
conversely  if prices move favorably  we could realize gains 
under our hedging and risk management strategy  realized gains or losses on derivative instruments will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold to customers at market prices  or delivered to customers as it pertains to fixed price contracts 

table of contents futures are traded with brokers of the nymex and require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term by physical delivery  and swap and options contracts are generally settled at expiration through a net settlement mechanism 
market risks associated with our derivative instruments are monitored daily for compliance with our hedging and risk management policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
credit risk exchange traded futures and options contracts are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk with over the counter forward  swap and options contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
we evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to the risk of non performance by our counterparties 
interest rate risk a portion of our borrowings bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon  at the operating partnership s option  libor  plus an applicable margin or the base rate  defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus of or the agent bank s prime rate  or libor plus  plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent on the level of the partnership s total consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
we manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swaps have been designated as a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recognized in other comprehensive income oci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
at september   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a net liability of million  which is included within other current liabilities and other liabilities  as applicable  with a corresponding unrealized loss reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
derivative instruments and hedging activities all of our derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet at their fair values 
on the date that derivative instruments are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or oci  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci to the extent effective and reclassified into earnings during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges  and that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sale exemption  are recorded in earnings as they occur 
cash flows associated with derivative instruments are reported as operating activities within the consolidated statement of cash flows 

table of contents sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in commodities related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions a 
the fair value of open positions as of september  b 
the market prices for the underlying commodities used to determine a 
above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change and compared to the fair value amounts in a 
above to project the potential negative impact on earnings that would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for open derivative instruments as of september  indicates an increase in potential future net losses of million as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio
