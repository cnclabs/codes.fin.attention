the remaining decline was attributed to the wps segment in which the sales decline  increased pricing pressures and the challenging global economy equally contributed to the reduced gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the reason for this decline was sales mix  as we realized no sales growth in the higher margin wps business and modest growth in the ids business

table of contents income taxes the company effective tax rate from continuing operations was in fiscal  compared to the effective tax rate from continuing operations of in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was significantly impacted by the million non deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge recorded on the wps americas and ids asia reporting units during the three months ended july   as well as a tax charge of million associated with the funding of the pdc acquisition 
excluding these items  our fiscal effective tax rate from continuing operations would have been  slightly lower than the prior year due mainly to fluctuation in profit mix 
refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies within item for further discussion regarding the goodwill impairment charges 
the effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the lower tax rate in fiscal was due primarily to excess foreign tax credits recognized as a benefit to tax expense from continuing operations 
loss from discontinued operations discontinued operations consist of the asia die cut business platform  which was classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of fiscal during the three months ended july   the company incorporated its european based die cut business  balkhausen  into the asia die cut disposal group 
in addition  the following previously divested businesses were reported within discontinued operations brady medical and varitronics divested in fiscal  etimark divested in fiscal and teklynx divested in fiscal 
these divested businesses were part of the ids business segment 
the loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the loss in fiscal primarily related to a million write down of the disposal group to estimated fair value less cost to sell

table of contents id solutions fiscal vs 
net sales increased by from fiscal to fiscal  which consisted of organic growth of  currency impact of a negative and growth from acquisitions of 
acquisition growth within the ids segment was almost entirely generated by the acquisition of pdc in december  with a small portion contributed by the acquisition of grafo in march the pdc acquisition contributed more than million in sales in fiscal and provides an entry for the company into the healthcare identification space 
we are in the process of integrating pdc into the existing business  and plan to leverage brady practices in all functional areas 
organic sales in the ids segment grew by primarily due to growth within the americas of approximately  which was partially offset by modest declines in europe and apac 
within the americas  north america growth was partially offset by a decline in brazil 
sales over the internet increased by more than  and we experienced a positive response to our recent new product launches 
in europe  the decline in the ids business platform was mainly driven by the economy  partially offset by our increased presence in emerging geographies  new and differentiated product launches  and our strategy to increase share in specific vertical markets 
in apac  sales growth was modest  as the de consolidation of certain business units from the asia die cut disposal group impacted sales growth negatively 
overall  sales globally were driven by new product launches and growth within vertical markets 
new products launched include the bbp printer  which is a continuous sleeving wire identification system for high volume applications in the electrical and aerospace markets  and three new high performance materials to address the changing requirements for identification of printed circuit boards and electronic components 
vertical market growth was focused within the chemical  oil  and gas industries  as well as our targeted strategic account management programs 
segment profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the primary driver of the profit increase was the acquisition of pdc 
this profit was partially offset by a decline in profitability in brazil and western europe 
brazil decline was due to a combination of sales decline  cost increases and expenses associated with the implementation of a new erp system 
in western europe  the largest decline in sales and profit was in italy  where we realized a sales decline partially due to one time sales in the prior year that did not repeat 
in addition  italy profitability was impacted by product quality issues associated with a printer introduced in fiscal the company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment on may   and subsequently concluded that the ids apac reporting unit was impaired 
although sales grew from to  profit declined and neither were as high as anticipated 
specifically  fourth quarter fiscal gross margin and segment profit declined compared to the prior year  while results were anticipated to increase over the prior year fourth quarter 
in addition  projections were not sufficient to support the balance of goodwill remaining within the reporting unit 
as such  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during fiscal  which represents all of the remaining goodwill for this reporting unit 
fiscal vs 
net sales increased by from fiscal to fiscal  which consisted of organic growth of  currency impact of a negative and growth from acquisitions of 
the company acquired grafo in south africa as part of the ids segment in march organic sales in the ids segment grew 
regionally  growth in the americas was strong at  growth in europe was modest at approximately and apac declined by more than 
overall  during fiscal the us economy appeared to be recovering while the european economy was weakening 
within the americas  the strong growth rates were driven by the execution across multiple key growth initiatives  including a strong focus on our core distributor based business delivering an improved customer experience  improvements in the e commerce experience  key customer conversions  and an improved service offering 
new product development continued to drive growth globally with the successful launch of portable printers and proprietary consumables 
in europe  despite negative economic growth  we grew modestly as we continued to focus on emerging economies 
in asia  we experienced significant declines in several countries 
during fiscal  we began the process to separate the sales and marketing resources between the traditional ids products and the die cut business platform 
segment profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the profit increase was attributable to the americas business mainly due to strong sales growth  selected price increases  operational improvements  focus on lean and strategic sourcing  as well as actions taken to improve our selling expense structure

net sales decreased by from fiscal to  which consisted of an organic decline of  currency impact of a negative and growth from acquisitions of 
the company acquired runelandhs and pervaco in europe in may organic sales in the wps segment declined within all geographies from fiscal to  and have declined for the last seven quarters 
wps apac sales are generated entirely in australia  and have declined for the last four quarters mainly due to the weakness in the australian economy 
in the americas and europe  organic sales declined by and  respectively 
beginning in fiscal  we experienced a deterioration of this business due to increased e commerce competition and pricing pressures 
the company continues to modify its strategy to grow this business  which includes investments in e commerce capabilities  pricing structure changes and expansion of product offerings 
segment profit decreased in fiscal to million from million  a decline of million or 
this was primarily due to volume and price declines as a result of increased competition and reduced catalog advertising 
in addition  the company redirected some of its investment from the traditional catalog model to e business  the benefits of which are anticipated to be realized in future fiscal years 
since the global economic recession of  organic growth within the wps americas reporting unit has been difficult to achieve  especially within mature markets such as the us and canada where business to business transactions over the internet are more advanced than many of the european and australian markets 
with the acceleration of the internet in the business to business market  competition and pricing pressure have intensified 
as a result  organic sales declined by approximately and segment profit declined by nearly during fiscal as compared to fiscal the company is modifying its strategy within the wps platform  including investments in enhanced e commerce capabilities  expanded product offerings  enhanced industry specific expertise  and adjusting its pricing strategies 
although management believes the strategy modifications will improve organic sales and profitability of the wps platform in future years  there is risk associated with any strategy 
as such  the company annual goodwill impairment analysis step one reflected the risk in the strategy and the decline in fiscal sales and profitability  which occurred during a period of time in which the company was redirecting its investment from the traditional catalog model to e business 
in addition  the rate of decline became more pronounced during the second half of the fiscal year and fell short of internal forecasts  resulting in the conclusion that wps americas failed step one  as the resulting fair value was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit 
upon completion of the impairment assessment  the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million during fiscal in conjunction with the goodwill impairment test of the wps americas reporting unit  indefinite lived tradenames associated with the reporting unit were revalued and analyzed for impairment

however  future cash needs could require the company to repatriate additional cash to the us from foreign jurisdictions  which could result in material tax charges recognized in the period in which the transactions occur

off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have material off balance sheet arrangements or related party transactions 
the company is not aware of factors that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity trends  other than the risk factors described in this and other company filings 
however  the following additional information is provided to assist those reviewing the company s financial statements 
operating leases the leases generally are entered into for investments in facilities such as manufacturing facilities  warehouses and office space  computer equipment and company vehicles 
purchase commitments the company has purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services  and property  plant and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of its business 
in the aggregate  such commitments are not in excess of current market prices and are not material to the financial position of the company 
due to the proprietary nature of many of the company s materials and processes  certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination 
the company does not believe a material amount of penalties will be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations 
other contractual obligations the company does not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity 
related party transactions based on an evaluation for the year ended july   the company does not have material related party transactions that affect the results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
payments due under contractual obligations the company s future commitments in continuing operations at july  for long term debt  operating lease obligations  purchase obligations  interest obligations and other obligations are as follows dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years uncertain timeframe long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations interest obligations tax obligations other obligations total purchase obligations include all open purchase orders as of july  other obligations represent expected payments under the company s us postretirement medical plan and international pension plans as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  under item of this report 
inflation and changing prices essentially all of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of its products in competitive markets 
because prices are influenced by market conditions  it is not always possible to fully recover cost increases through pricing 
changes in product mix from year to year  timing differences in instituting price changes  and the large amount of part numbers make it impracticable to accurately define the impact of inflation on profit margins 

table of contents critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments 
the company believes the following accounting estimates are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely from period to period 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimates  refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on pre tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s effective income tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
the company establishes liabilities when it is more likely than not that the company will not realize the full tax benefit of the position 
the company adjusts these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances 
tax regulations may require items of income and expense to be included in a tax return in different periods than the items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective income tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements may be different than the tax rate reported in the income tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the income tax return  and some are temporary differences  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as tax deductions or credits in the tax return in future years for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the amount of expected future taxable income will not support the use of the deduction or credit 
the determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies  and can also be impacted by changes to tax laws 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on an income tax return but has not yet recognized as expense in the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when  based upon the technical merits  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination 
judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions 
the company generally re evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and recognizes an uncertain tax benefit when i there is completion of a tax audit  ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance  or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 
the company does not provide for us deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non us affiliates and associated companies that have been re invested indefinitely 
these earnings related to ongoing operations have been reinvested in non us business operations  and the company does not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations 
in fiscal  the company repatriated approximately million of foreign cash to help fund the acquisition of pdc 
of this amount  approximately million was from earnings that would otherwise be classified as permanently re invested 
the company determined that given pdc was the largest acquisition in the company history  this repatriation was a one time event  and therefore  in management judgment  the remaining cumulative earnings have been reinvested indefinitely 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
in addition  accounting guidance requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment 
if circumstances or events prior to the date of the required annual assessment indicate that  in management judgment  it is more likely than not that 
table of contents there has been a reduction of fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value  the company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such circumstance or event 
changes in management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
to aid in establishing the value of goodwill and other intangible assets at the time of acquisition  company policy requires that all acquisitions with goodwill of greater than million require the use of external valuations 
during the three months ended april   the company announced its plan to divest its asia die cut business  and during the three months ended july   the company added its european based die cut business  balkhausen  to the disposal group 
effective may   the company reorganized its management structure into three global business platforms identification solutions  workplace safety  and die cut 
because the die cut business platform was classified as held for sale as of april   the disposal group was recorded at its estimated fair value less cost to sell  which required a write down in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment and it was excluded from the fiscal annual goodwill impairment analysis 
the company has identified two operating segments for the year ended july  identification solutions and workplace safety 
these operating segments are also the company s reportable segments 
the company has identified six reporting units within its two operating segments as of july  ids americas europe  ids apac  peopleid  wps americas  wps europe  and wps apac 
brady continues to believe that the discounted cash flow model and market multiples model provide a reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company reporting units 
the projections of future operating results  which are based on both past performance and the projections and assumptions used in the company current and long range operating plans  are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
significant estimates used by management in the discounted cash flows methodology include estimates of future cash flows based on expected growth rates  price increases  fluctuations in gross margin and sg a as a percentage of sales  capital expenditures  working capital levels  income tax rates  the benefits of recent acquisitions and expected synergies  and a weighted average cost of capital that reflects the specific risk profile of the reporting unit being tested 
significant negative industry or economic trends  disruptions to the company business  loss of significant customers  inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses  unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure  and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations 
in the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  including goodwill  the company would then perform an additional assessment that would compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the determination of the implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
if necessary  the company may consult valuation specialists to assist with the assessment of the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities for the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment charge would be recorded 
the company considers a reporting unit s value to be substantially in excess of its fair value at or greater 
the annual impairment testing performed on may   in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other step one indicated that each of the following reporting units had a fair value substantially in excess of its carrying value ids americas europe  wps europe and wps apac 
the peopleid reporting unit passed step one of the goodwill impairment test  but does not have a fair value substantially in excess of its carrying value 
the company concluded that the wps americas and ids apac reporting units failed step one of the goodwill impairment test 
wps americas goodwill impairment management proceeded to measure the amount of the potential impairment step two for the wps americas reporting unit with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
the company calculated the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had been acquired in a business combination  and the excess fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities was the implied fair value of goodwill 
upon completion of the assessment  the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million during the three months ended july  in conjunction with the goodwill impairment test of the wps americas reporting unit  the carrying value of the indefinite lived tradenames within the reporting unit were compared to the fair value calculated as part of the step two analysis described above 
indefinite lived tradenames in the amount of million associated with the wps segment were impaired during the three months ended july  
table of contents ids apac goodwill impairment the ids apac reporting unit had goodwill remaining of million at the annual impairment assessment date 
sales increased within this reporting unit from to  however  profitability declined  and neither sales nor profitability were as high as anticipated 
projections for the business were not sufficient to support the carrying value of the reporting unit 
when management compared the step one fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit  a qualitative assessment was completed for step two because the amount by which the carrying value exceeded fair value was more than the balance of goodwill remaining 
as such  the company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of the entire remaining goodwill balance of million during the three months ended july  sensitivity in performing the fiscal annual goodwill impairment assessment  the company completed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models for each of its reporting units 
even though the fair value was substantially in excess of carrying value  the company is providing a detailed sensitivity analysis of the wps europe and wps apac reporting units given the higher level of risk in the overall wps strategy 
the fair value of the wps europe reporting unit was substantially in excess of carrying value at the assessment date  and it had a goodwill balance of million as of july  in order to conclude upon the assumptions for the discounted cash flow analysis  the company considered multiple factors  including a macroeconomic conditions  b industry and market factors such as competition and changes in the market for the reporting unit products  c overall financial performance such as cash flows  actual and planned revenue  and profitability  and d changes in strategy for the reporting unit 
the assumption with the most impact on our determination of fair value of the wps europe reporting unit is profitability 
a reduction in the annual profitability assumption by basis points results in a decrease in the amount of fair value in excess of carrying value of the fair value of the wps apac reporting unit was substantially in excess of carrying value at the assessment date  and it had a goodwill balance of million as of july  in order to conclude upon the assumptions for the discounted cash flow analysis  the company considered multiple factors  including a macroeconomic conditions  b industry and market factors such as competition and changes in the market for the reporting unit products  c overall financial performance such as cash flows  actual and planned revenue  and profitability  and d changes in strategy for the reporting unit 
the assumption with the most impact on our determination of fair value of the wps apac reporting unit is profitability 
a reduction in the annual profitability assumption by basis points results in a decrease in the amount of fair value in excess of carrying value of 
the fair value of the peopleid reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value by as of the assessment date 
this reporting unit is comprised solely of pdc  which was acquired on december  and had a goodwill balance of million as of july  in order to conclude upon the assumptions for the discounted cash flow analysis  the company considered multiple factors  including a macroeconomic conditions  b industry and market factors such as competition and changes in the market for the reporting unit products  c overall financial performance such as cash flows  actual and planned revenue  and profitability  and d changes in strategy for the reporting unit 
if the peopleid reporting unit does not meet its projections it could become impaired 
the assumptions with the most impact on our determination of the fair value of the peopleid reporting unit are sales growth and profitability 
a reduction in the annual sales growth or annual profitability assumptions by basis points results in a failure of step one of the goodwill impairment test 
in connection with the company recent change in reportable segments  the existing peopleid business  which was part of the ids americas and europe reporting unit for the annual goodwill impairment analysis  was integrated into the peopleid reporting unit effective august  if these businesses had been combined as of the may  goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value in excess of carrying value would have been
