foreign currency hedging we have foreign currency cash flow and earnings exposure with respect to specific sale and intercompany debt transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the unit incurring the costs associated with such transactions 
to mitigate the risks related to these exposures  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances  to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain on the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedging strategy 
in south america  substantially all of our net sales are indexed to us dollars  but the associated costs are recorded in the local currencies of the operating units 
generally  we do not hedge this us dollar exposure as it would not be cost effective due to the relatively inefficient foreign exchange markets for local currencies in that region 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
the value of these contracts is recognized at fair value based on market exchange forward rates and amounted to a net asset position of  at december  these contracts mature at various dates through june of as of december   we had open foreign currency exchange contracts maturing through june of with total net notional amounts of approximately million 
at december   a hypothetical adverse exchange rate movement of against our forward foreign exchange contracts would have resulted in a potential net loss in fair value of these contracts of approximately million 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
any gain or loss recognized on a foreign exchange contract would generally be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying hedge transaction 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes may affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices

interest rate hedging we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
our debt consists of a secured credit facility with variable interest rates and unsecured notes which bear interest at fixed rates 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps and caps in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we generally do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding of which million is protected by interest rate caps 
see note derivatives and hedging to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our interest rate caps 
if the weighted average interest rates on this variable rate debt had been basis points higher  the annual interest expense would have increased by a nominal amount
