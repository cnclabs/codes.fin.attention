item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements under item and other information in this report  including critical accounting policies and cautionary information included at the end of this item the following discussion and analysis includes the results of operations for the twelve month periods ended september and september for more information regarding our business segments  see item business of this annual report 
business update wholesale segment over the past several years our wholesale business has been highly focused on a number of evolving trends within the convenience store industry which represents the majority of our customer base 
these trends include industry consolidation both convenience stores and the wholesale distributors which serve them are requiring larger economies of scale to effectively compete 
accordingly  both convenience stores and wholesale distributors are consolidating 
while this creates opportunities for our company to acquire smaller competitors  we also face a significant risk that our customers may be acquired by convenience store chains not serviced by us 
this consolidation trend has impacted profit margins industry wide 

table of contents demand for cigarettes the sale of cigarettes represents approximately of total in store sales for convenience stores according to nacs 
during fiscal  cigarette sales accounted for of our consolidated revenues 
the demand for cigarettes and tobacco has been decreasing since the s due to a general decline in the number of smokers in the united states and the impact of legislative actions such as smoking bans and higher excise taxes 
technology convenience stores are increasingly relying on technology to manage their business 
the ability of distributors to provide capabilities such as inventory scanning  electronic price books  sku rationalization  category management  and access to robust management reporting to their convenience store customers is growing in importance 
other factors in addition to these larger trends  a number of external forces could create additional headwinds for the industry in the coming years 
for example  beginning january  changes under the new patient protection and affordable care act aca permit insurance companies to charge tobacco users up to fifty percent more for health insurance policies than those offered to non tobacco users 
while the initial impact of these aca provisions on tobacco demand is not expected to be significant  that may change over time 
additionally  it is possible that tiered health insurance premiums will become more common for individuals deemed to be obese or have other medical conditions considered to be lifestyle oriented 
these shifts in the health insurance market may directly impact the demand and kinds of products sold within the convenience store channel 
in addition to the above considerations  the industry is experiencing increased competition from new market entrants such as well capitalized national drug and dollar stores 
while not direct competitors  these retail formats often target product categories historically carried by convenience stores 
despite these changes in the market place  the convenience store channel remains highly adaptive and innovative 
the declining demand for cigarettes and tobacco products is well understood within the industry and most convenience store owners are positioning their businesses for a future which is less reliant on these products 
accordingly  our company has been heavily focused on assisting independent convenience store owners re position their businesses 
independent convenience store owners represent a large portion of our customer base and over of the industry  total locations 
these efforts have focused on introducing new product lines and merchandising programs to improve sales turnover and profit margins 
categories such as snacks and fresh bakery items have recently experienced a tremendous wave of innovation around flavors  healthy alternatives  and consumer friendly packing ie non spill or resealable containers 
additionally  items such as gourmet sandwiches and wraps  specialty drinks and juices  and yogurts offer new growth areas and alternatives to declining cigarette sales 
in an effort to further differentiate our company from price only competition  we have emphasized a range of services centered around store re imaging and technology 
store re imaging is becoming more important as customer expectations around store design and layout  lighting  color schemes  and cleanliness standards are being lifted industry wide by the most progressive convenience store chains 
we also see technology as an effective way to counter price only competition 
many wholesale distributors offer very limited technology solutions to their convenience store customers 
these distributors will likely struggle to satisfy the coming wave of demand for new customer facing technologies such as mobile applications that provide information about product specials or the ability to place orders remotely 

table of contents the future we believe the direction of wholesale distribution is becoming less about transporting highly commoditized products and more about providing differentiated merchandising and technology solutions to customers 
while we expect the operating environment to remain highly competitive  we believe our long legacy of serving independent and fast growing small convenience store operations positions us well to capitalize on these changes 
business update retail segment the retail health food industry posted another record year during the calendar year  with sales topping billion  a increase over the calendar year according to the natural foods merchandiser nfm 
this compares to a sales growth rate of for traditional supermarkets according to the progressive grocer and represents two consecutive years of sales growth of at least industry wide 
two emerging industry trends gained significant momentum during heightened attention to food ingredients by consumers and increased competition 
these emerging trends present both opportunities and challenges for our own retail health food business 
food ingredients we believe a number of factors are influencing the increasing demand and acceptance of natural products 
first  during a range of high profile media stories and research reports were released covering subjects such as the arsenic levels in rice  the impact of genetic modified organisms gmos in processed foods particularly corn based products  and the potential link between gluten and soy allergies and food additives 
these stories and research reports were closely followed by the general media and generated a significant amount of interest among food companies  retailers  and consumers 
additionally  a number of nationally syndicated medical tv programs continue to run frequent programming on topics related to good health and diet 
collectively  we believe this ongoing media coverage is helping fuel the increasing demand for natural products 
increased competition the growth in the demand for natural products has not gone unnoticed 
the second major trend which emerged during was an increase in competition 
over the past several years  a wide range of well financed competitors have entered the industry 
regional and national competitors such as whole foods market  trader joe  sprouts farmers market  and natural grocers have all engaged in new store expansion strategies  often opening new retail sites in close proximity to our existing stores 
additionally  the purchase of consumer health products over the internet continues to grow and compete with brick and mortar retailers 
the midwestern united states in particular has experienced an increase in competition over the past year which has pressured sales and gross margins 
identifying organic growth and strategic acquisition opportunities remains a top priority for our management team 
during fiscal  the company opened two new akin health food stores located in northwest arkansas and nebraska 
we continue to believe that mid market cities still offer attractive options for new store expansion 
our new site selection criteria focuses on areas with strong real estate sites that can accommodate a lively and dynamic customer experience that we strive to create in all of our stores 
all of our new stores must adhere to our specific screening criteria 
for over years  our health food stores have succeeded with a simple value proposition  helping our customers maintain good health 
while consumer tastes and product offerings will evolve and change over time  we believe our customer focused philosophy will remain attractive 
results of operations the following table sets forth an analysis of various components of the company statement of operations as a percentage of sales for fiscal years and fiscal years sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income preferred stock dividend requirements net income available to common shareholders 
table of contents fiscal years incr decr in millions change consolidated sales cost of sales gross profit gross profit percentage operating expense operating income interest expense income tax expense net income business segments wholesale sales gross profit gross profit percentage retail sales gross profit gross profit percentage sales are reported net of costs associated with incentives provided to retailers 
these incentives totaled million in fiscal and million in fiscal amounts calculated based on actual changes in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sales changes in sales are driven by two primary components i changes to selling prices  which are largely controlled by our product suppliers  and excise taxes imposed on cigarettes and tobacco products by various states  and ii changes in the volume of products sold to our customers  either due to a change in purchasing patterns resulting from consumer preferences or the fluctuation in the comparable number of business days in our reporting period 
sales fiscal vs 
fiscal sales in our wholesale segment increased million from fiscal to fiscal significant items impacting sales during fiscal included a million increase in sales related to price increases implemented by cigarette manufacturers  a million increase in sales related to higher state excise taxes between the comparative periods  and a million increase in sales in our other product categories 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in sales primarily related to the volume and mix of cigarette cartons sold 
sales in our retail segment decreased approximately million from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  our akin retail stores experienced lower sales due to increased competition from national and regional health food chains 
this decrease in sales was partially offset by revenue generated at our two new retail stores which opened during fiscal  as well as higher sales in our florida market stores 
gross profit fiscal vs 
fiscal our gross profit does not include fulfillment costs and costs related to the distribution network which are included in selling  general and administrative costs  and may not be comparable to those of other entities 
some entities may classify such costs as a component of cost of sales 
cost of sales  a component used in determining gross profit  for the wholesale and retail segments includes the cost of products purchased from manufacturers  less incentives we receive which are netted against such costs 
gross profit in our wholesale segment decreased million from fiscal to fiscal of this decrease in gross profit  approximately million related to changes in the overall volume and mix of cigarette cartons sold as well as a reduction in benefits related to state excise tax increases 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in gross profit in our other product categories 
gross profit in our retail segment increased million from fiscal to fiscal during fiscal  we experienced an increase in gross profit from the opening of two new retail stores as well as higher gross margin in our florida market stores 
these increases were partially offset by lower gross profit in our existing akin retail stores 
operating expense fiscal vs 
fiscal operating expense includes selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include costs related to our sales  warehouse  delivery and administrative departments for all segments 
specifically  purchasing and receiving costs  warehousing costs and costs of picking and loading customer orders are all classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
our most significant expenses relate to employee and facility costs  equipment leases  transportation costs  fuel costs  insurance  and professional fees 
fiscal consolidated operating expenses increased million as compared to significant items impacting operating expenses during fiscal included a million increase in operating expenses in our retail segment  primarily related to higher employee costs and the opening of new health food retail 
table of contents stores 
this increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in our wholesale segment operating expenses 
income tax expense fiscal vs 
fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the increase in effective tax rates from fiscal to fiscal was primarily related to changes in the amount of nondeductible expenses under the internal revenue service code 
liquidity and capital resources overview general 
the company requires cash to pay operating expenses  purchase inventory  and make capital investments 
in general  the company finances its cash flow requirements with cash generated from operating activities and credit facility borrowings 
operating activities 
during fiscal  the company generated cash of approximately million from operating activities 
significant sources of cash during the period included lower accounts receivable and other current assets combined with the impact of net earnings 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable 
our variability in cash flows from operating activities is dependent on the timing of inventory purchases and seasonal fluctuations 
for example  periodically we have inventory buy in opportunities which offer more favorable pricing terms 
as a result  we may have to hold inventory for a period longer than the payment terms 
this generates a cash outflow from operating activities which we expect to reverse in later periods 
additionally  during the warm weather months  which is our peak time of operations  we generally carry higher amounts of inventory to ensure high fill rates and customer satisfaction 
investing activities 
the company used cash of million during fiscal for investing activities 
these investing activities primarily related to capital expenditures on property and equipment in our wholesale business segment in addition to capital expenditures related to the opening of two retail stores in our retail segment 
financing activities 
the company used cash of million from financing activities during fiscal of this amount  approximately million related to net borrowings on the company credit facilty 
these borrowings were offset by million related to repayments on long term debt  million related to the repurchase of the company common stock and series b convertible preferred stock  million related to dividends on the company common and preferred stock  and million related to equity based stock awards 
cash on hand working capital 
at september  the company had cash on hand of million and working capital current assets less current liabilities of million 
this compares to cash on hand of million and working capital of million at september the company primarily finances its operations through a credit agreement the facility with bank of america 
the facility included the following significant terms at september a july maturity date without a penalty for prepayment 
million revolving credit limit 
loan accordion allowing the company to increase the size of the credit facility agreement by million 
a provision providing an additional million of credit advances for certain inventory purchases 

table of contents evergreen renewal clause automatically renewing the agreement for one year unless either the borrower or lender provides written notice terminating the agreement at least days prior to the end of any original or renewal term of the agreement 
the facility bears interest at either the bank prime rate  or at libor plus basis points depending on certain credit facility utilization measures  at the election of the company 
lending limits subject to accounts receivable and inventory limitations 
an unused commitment fee equal to one quarter of one percent per annum on the difference between the maximum loan limit and average monthly borrowings 
secured by collateral including all of the company equipment  intangibles  inventories  and accounts receivable 
a financial covenant requiring a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least as measured by the previous twelve month period then ended only if excess availability falls below of the maximum loan limit as defined in the credit agreement 
provides that the company may not pay dividends on its common stock in excess of per share on an annual basis 
there is no limit on dividend payments provided that certain excess availability measurements have been maintained for the thirty day period immediately prior to the payment of any such dividends or distributions  and immediately after giving effect to any such dividend or distribution payments  the company has a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to as defined in the credit facility agreement 
the amount available for use on the facility at any given time is subject to a number of factors including eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances that fluctuate day to day 
based on our collateral and loan limits as defined in the facility agreement  the credit limit of the facility at september was million  of which million was outstanding  leaving million available 
at september  the revolving portion of the company facility balance bore interest based on the bank prime rate and various short term libor rate elections made by the company 
the average interest rate was at september during fiscal  our peak borrowings under the facility were million and our average borrowings and average availability was million and million  respectively 
our availability to borrow under the facility generally decreases as inventory and accounts receivable levels increase because of the borrowing limitations that are placed on collateralized assets 
cross default and co terminus provisions the company owned real estate in bismarck  nd  quincy  il  and rapid city  sd  is financed through a term loan with bmo harris  na bmo which is also a participant lender on the company revolving line of credit 
the bmo loan contains cross default provisions which cause the loan with bmo to be considered in default if the loans where bmo is a lender  including the revolving credit facility  is in default 
there were no such cross defaults at september in addition  the bmo loan contain co terminus provisions which require all loans with bmo to be paid in full if any of the loans are paid in full prior to the end of their specified terms 
other the company has issued a letter of credit for million to its workers compensation insurance carrier as part of its self insured loss control program 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity risk the company liquidity position is significantly influenced by its ability to maintain sufficient levels of working capital 
for our company and industry in general  customer credit risk and ongoing access to bank credit heavily influence liquidity positions 
the company does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk or fuel costs 
accordingly  significant price movements in these areas can and do impact the company profitability 
the company believes its liquidity position going forward will be adequate to sustain operations 
however  a precipitous change in operating environment could materially impact the company future revenue stream as well as its ability to collect on customer accounts receivable or secure bank credit 
other matters critical accounting estimates general the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the company to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates are set forth below and have not changed during fiscal allowance for doubtful accounts nature of estimates required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable at the balance sheet date 
we monitor our credit exposure on a daily basis and regularly assess the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
because credit losses can vary significantly over time  estimating the required allowance requires a number of assumptions that are uncertain 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our required allowance for doubtful accounts using the following key assumptions 
historical collections represented as the amount of historical uncollectible accounts as a percent of total accounts receivable 
specific credit exposure on certain accounts identified based on management review of the accounts receivable portfolio and taking into account the financial wherewithal of particular customers that management deems to have a higher risk of collection 
market conditions we consider a broad range of industry trends and macro economic issues which may impact the creditworthiness of our customers 

table of contents inventories nature of estimates required 
in our businesses  we carry large quantities and dollar amounts of inventory 
inventories primarily consist of finished products purchased in bulk quantities to be sold to our customers 
given the large quantities and broad range of products we carry  there is a risk that inventory may become impaired because it has become unsaleable or unrefundable  slow moving  obsolete  or because it has been discontinued 
the use of estimates is required in determining the salvage value of this inventory 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate our inventory obsolescence reserve at each balance sheet date based on the following criteria slow moving products items identified as slow moving are evaluated on a case by case basis for impairment 
obsolete discontinued inventory products identified that are near or beyond their expiration dates 
we may also discontinue carrying certain product lines for our customers 
as a result  we estimate the market value of this inventory as if it were to be liquidated 
estimated salvage value sales price the salvage value of the inventory is estimated using management evaluation of the congestion in the distribution channels and experience with brokers and inventory liquidators to determine the salvage value of the inventory 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  intangible assets  and goodwill acquired in business combinations 
property and equipment and amortizable identified intangible assets are assigned useful lives ranging from to years 
indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
impairment of the company long lived assets is assessed during the company fourth fiscal quarter or whenever events or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value of such long lived assets may not be recoverable 
the company recorded no impairment charges during either fiscal or fiscal nature of estimates required 
management has to estimate the useful lives of the company long lived assets 
in regard to the company impairment analysis  the most significant assumptions include management estimate of the annual growth rate used to project future sales and expenses 
assumptions and approach used 
for property and equipment  depreciable lives are based on our accounting policy which is intended to mirror the expected useful life of the asset 
in determining the estimated useful life of amortizable intangible assets  such as customer lists  we rely on our historical experience to estimate the useful life of the applicable asset and consider industry norms as a benchmark 
if impairment indicators arise  we then evaluate the potential impairment of property and equipment and amortizable identifiable intangible assets using an undiscounted future cash flow approach  in addition to other public and private company information 
when evaluating the potential impairment of non amortizable indefinite lived assets and goodwill we first assess a range of qualitative factors  including but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for the company products and services  regulatory and political developments  entity specific factors such as strategy and changes in key personnel  and the overall financial performance for each of the company reporting units 
if after completing this assessment  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we proceed to a two step impairment testing methodology using the income approach discounted cash flow method 

table of contents a discounted cash flow methodology requires estimation in i forecasting future earnings ii determining the discount rate applicable to the earnings stream being discounted  and iii computing a terminal value at some point in the future 
the forecast of future earnings is an estimate of future financial performance based on current year results and management evaluation of the market potential for growth 
the discount rate is a weighted average cost of capital using a targeted debt to equity ratio using the industry average under the assumption that it represents our optimal capital structure and can be achieved in a reasonable time period 
the terminal value is determined using a commonly accepted growth model 
insurance the company insurance for workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits are provided through high deductible or self insured programs 
as a result  the company accrues for its workers compensation liability based upon claim reserves established with the assistance of a third party administrator  which are then trended and developed 
the reserves are evaluated at the end of each reporting period 
due to the uncertainty involved with the realization of claims incurred but unreported  management is required to make estimates of these claims 
assumptions and approach used 
in order to estimate our reserve for incurred but unreported claims we consider the following key factors employee health insurance claims historical claims experience we review loss runs for each month to calculate the average monthly claims experience 
lag period for reporting claims based on our analysis  our experience is such that we have a minimum of a one month lag period in which claims are reported 
workers compensation insurance claims historical claims experience we review prior years loss runs to estimate the average annual expected claims and review monthly loss runs to compare our estimates to actual claims 
lag period for reporting claims we review claims trends and use standard insurance industry loss models to develop reserves on reported claims in order to estimate the amount of incurred but unreported claims 
income taxes the company accounts for its income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future tax consequences are measured based on provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on a periodic basis  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and establish a related valuation allowance as appropriate 
in performing our evaluation  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
evidence used includes information about our current financial position and our results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 

table of contents assumptions and approach used 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management judgments regarding future events 
in making that estimate we consider the following key factors our current financial position  historical financial information  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in our wholesale segment when products are delivered to customers which generally is the same day products are shipped and in our retail health food segment when products are sold to consumers 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts  and sales incentives to customers 
nature of estimates required 
we estimate and reserve for anticipated sales discounts 
we also estimate and provide a reserve for anticipated sales incentives to customers when earned under established program requirements 
assumptions and approach used 
we estimate the sales reserves using the following criteria sales discounts we use historical experience to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected due to customers taking advantage of authorized term discounts 
volume sales incentives we use historical experience in combination with quarterly reviews of customers sales progress in order to estimate the amount of volume incentives due to the customers on a periodic basis 
our estimates and assumptions for each of the aforementioned critical accounting estimates have not changed materially during the periods presented  nor are we aware of any reasons that they would be reasonably likely to change in the future 
business combinations nature of estimates required 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and intangible assets acquired  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
assumptions and approach used 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to the projected growth factors  future expected cash flows  discount rates  potential competitive and regulatory environment developments  and changes in the market for the company products and services 
management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
additionally  estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as new information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

table of contents recently adopted accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu  presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists  which states that entities should present the unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of the deferred tax asset for a net operating loss nol or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward rather than as a liability when the uncertain tax position would reduce the nol or other carryforward under the tax law 
the company will be required to adopt this new standard on a prospective basis in the first interim reporting period of fiscal  however  early adoption is permitted as is a retrospective application 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that this new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements
