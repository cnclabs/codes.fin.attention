item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
background we are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the identification  development and commercialization of novel therapies that improve neurological function in people with multiple sclerosis  or ms  spinal cord injury  or sci  and other disorders of the nervous system 
ampyra general ampyra was approved by the fda in january for the improvement of walking in people with ms 
to our knowledge  ampyra is the first and only product approved for this indication 
efficacy was shown in people with all four major types of ms relapsing remitting  secondary progressive  progressive relapsing and primary progressive 
ampyra was made commercially available in the united states in march net revenue for ampyra was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  more than  new patients have tried ampyra therapy since the launch 
ampyra is marketed in the united states through our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure 
we currently have approximately sales representatives in the field calling on a priority target list of approximately  physicians 
we also have established teams of medical science liasons  regional reimbursement directors  and managed markets account managers who provide information and assistance to 
table of contents payers and physicians on ampyra  and market development managers who work collaboratively with field teams and corporate personnel to assist in the execution of the company s strategic initiatives 
ampyra is distributed in the united states exclusively through a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients by mail  kaiser permanente  which distributes ampyra to patients through a closed network of on site pharmacies  and asd specialty healthcare  inc an amerisourcebergen affiliate  which is the exclusive specialty pharmacy distributor for ampyra to the us department of veterans affairs  or va 
all of these customers are contractually obligated to hold no more than an agreed number of days of inventory  ranging from between to days 
we have contracted with a third party organization with extensive experience in coordinating patient benefits to run ampyra patient support services  or apss  a dedicated resource that coordinates the prescription process among healthcare providers  people with ms  and insurance carriers 
processing of most incoming requests for prescriptions by apss begins within hours of receipt 
patients will experience a range of times to receive their first shipment based on the processing time for insurance requirements 
as with any prescription product  patients who are members of benefit plans that have restrictive prior authorizations may experience delays in receiving their prescription 
three of the largest national health plans in the us aetna  united healthcare and cigna have listed ampyra in the lowest branded co pay tier of their commercial preferred drug list or formulary 
this formulary status at all three health plans was renewed in approximately of commercially insured individuals in the us continue to have no or limited prior authorizations  or pa s  for ampyra 
we define limited pas as those that require only an ms diagnosis  documentation of no contraindications  and or simple documentation that the patient has a walking impairment  such documentation may include a timed foot walk tw test 
the access figure is calculated based on the number of pharmacy lives reported by commercial health plans 
license and collaboration agreement with biogen idec ampyra is marketed as fampyra outside the us by biogen idec international gmbh  or biogen idec  under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into in june fampyra is commercially available in a number of european union countries and in canada  australia  new zealand and israel  and biogen idec anticipates making fampyra commercially available in additional markets in  as well as filing for regulatory approval in other countries 
we received a million milestone payment from biogen idec in  which was triggered by biogen idec s receipt of conditional approval from the european commission for fampyra 
the next expected milestone payment would be million  due when ex us net sales exceed million over four consecutive quarters 
ampyra development programs we believe there may be potential for ampyra to be applied to other indications within ms and also in other neurological conditions 
for example  in december  we initiated a phase proof of concept clinical study of dalfampridine in adults with cerebral palsy  or cp 
the first phase of this proof of concept study  which has been completed  was a single dose phase primarily to evaluate safety and tolerability prior to proceeding to a multi dose cohort 
this person  single dose phase of the study detected no safety signals that would prevent additional study of the drug in the treatment of cp 
we completed enrollment for the second phase  a multi dose study including adults with cp  to evaluate both safety and efficacy 
we expect to announce topline results of this phase of the study in the second quarter of also  in june we enrolled the first patient in a phase proof of concept trial of dalfampridine in post stroke deficits  and we expect to announce topline study results in the second quarter of this study is exploring the use of dalfampridine in patients who have experienced a stroke and who have stabilized with chronic neurologic deficits  which may include walking impairment and upper extremity function impairment  such as arm weakness 
over the first six months following a stroke  patients typically show some degree of spontaneous recovery of function  which may be enhanced by rehabilitation and physical therapy 
this trial is targeting motor impairments that remain after such recovery 
we 
table of contents also are providing grants for investigator initiated studies looking for potential benefits on a range of functional deficits in ms and other neurological disorders 
we are also working with external partners on a once daily formulation of ampyra 
ampyra patent update we have two issued patents listed in the orange book for ampyra  as follows the first is us patent no 
us  with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with ms by administering mg of sustained release aminopyridine dalfampridine twice daily 
based on the final patent term adjustment calculation of the united states patent and trademark office  or uspto  this patent will extend into the second is us patent no 
 the patent  the claims of which relate to methods for treating a neurological disease  such as ms  and cover the use of a sustained release dalfampridine formulation  such as ampyra dalfampridine extended release tablets  mg for improving walking in people with ms 
in october  the uspto determined that the patent is entitled to a full five year patent term extension under the patent restoration provisions of the hatch waxman act 
with a five year patent term extension  the patent would expire in we have an exclusive license to this patent from alkermes originally with elan  but transferred to alkermes as part of its acquisition of elan s drug technologies business 
on january   the uspto issued us patent no 
 us patent application no 
 with claims relating to methods to improve walking  walking speed  lower extremity muscle tone and lower extremity muscle strength in patients with ms by administering mg of sustained release aminopyridine dalfampridine twice daily 
in  the european patent office  or epo  granted the counterpart european patent with claims relating to  among other things  use of a sustained release aminopyridine composition  such as dalfampridine  to increase walking speed 
in march  synthon bv and neuraxpharm arzneimittel gmbh filed oppositions with the epo challenging this granted european patent 
we intend to vigorously defend the european patent  although the outcome of opposition proceedings is unpredictable 
dalfampridine er mg 
post approval commitment study in august  we announced results from a post approval commitment study examining the use of a mg dose of dalfampridine er to improve walking in people with ms 
the study failed to confirm efficacy of the mg dose 
we believe that this study  together with ampyra registration studies  continue to show that mg twice daily is the appropriate  safe  and effective dose 
the study results were provided to the fda and will be presented in peer reviewed scientific forums 
zanaflex zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets are fda approved as short acting drugs for the management of spasticity  a symptom of many central nervous system  or cns  disorders  including ms and sci 
these products contain tizanidine hydrochloride  one of the two leading drugs used to treat spasticity 
we launched zanaflex capsules in april as part of our strategy to build a commercial platform for the potential market launch of ampyra 
combined net revenue of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in february  apotex commercially launched a generic version of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules  and we also launched our own authorized generic version  which is being marketed by watson pharma a subsidiary of actavis 
the commercial launch of generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules has caused a significant decline in net revenue of zanaflex capsules  and the launch of these generic versions and the potential launch of other generic versions is expected to cause the company s net revenue from zanaflex capsules to decline further in and beyond 
in 
table of contents may  we received a paragraph iv certification notice from mylan laboratories limited advising us that mylan laboratories has filed an abbreviated new drug application for generic versions of the three dosage strengths of zanaflex capsules 
the fda approved mylan s anda on november  based upon our request  the fda delisted from the orange book the patent against which mylan laboratories filed the paragraph iv certification notice 
research development programs our lead research and development programs include three distinct therapeutic approaches to restoring neurologic and cardiac function and a fourth program  initiated in  to develop an acute treatment for neurological trauma 
we believe that these programs have broad applicability and have the potential to be first in class therapies 
while our existing programs have been focused on ms and sci  we believe they may be applicable across a number of cns disorders  including stroke and traumatic brain injury  or tbi  because many of the mechanisms of tissue damage and repair are similar 
in addition  we believe that some of our research and development programs may have applicability beyond the nervous system  including in the field of cardiology 
glial growth factor we have completed our ggf phase clinical trial in heart failure patients 
this was a dose escalating trial designed to test the maximum tolerated single dose  with follow up assessments at one  three  and six months 
we have completed analysis of the three month data  and we plan to present findings in a platform presentation at the american college of cardiology acc annual meeting in march we will also discuss the data with the fda before proceeding to a multiple dose study 
if we are able to establish a proof of concept for treatment of heart failure through human clinical studies  we may decide to develop the product independently or to enter into a partnership  most likely with a cardiovascular focused company 
remyelinating antibodies we have an open ind application for one of the remyelinating antibodies  rhigm  for the treatment of ms and plan to initiate enrollment in a phase safety study in ms patients in the first half of we had previously announced problems with a bioactivity assay that had delayed the filing but we successfully completed the qualification of the bioactivity assay in the second quarter of in preparation for an ind filing  we worked with a contract manufacturer to complete the scale up manufacturing and purification processes and completed formal preclinical safety and toxicity studies 
chondroitinase program we are continuing research on the potential use of chondroitinases for the treatment of injuries to the brain and spinal cord  as well as other neurotraumatic indications 
the chondroitinase program is in the research and translational development phase and has not yet entered formal preclinical development 
ac in june  we entered into a license agreement with medtronic  inc and one of its affiliates  pursuant to which we acquired worldwide development and commercialization rights to certain formulations of magnesium with a polymer such as polyethylene glycol which we refer to as ac 
pursuant to the license agreement  we paid medtronic an upfront fee of million and are obligated to pay up to an additional million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and development milestones 
if we commercialize ac  we will also be obligated to pay a single digit royalty on sales 
we plan to study ac as an acute treatment for patients who have suffered neurological trauma  such as sci and tbi 
we submitted a phase clinical trial protocol for ac for acute treatment of sci to the fda for review 
the protocol has been reviewed by the fda  and we are preparing to initiate the trial in the first half of 
table of contents corporate updates in july  we relocated our corporate headquarters from hawthorne  new york  to a facility in ardsley  new york consisting of an aggregate of approximately  square feet of office and laboratory space 
base rent is initially million per year  subject to a annual increase 
our lease of the facility has a year term  but we have options to extend the lease term for three additional five year periods  and we may terminate the lease after years  subject to payment of an early termination fee 
we also have the right to lease up to approximately  additional square feet of space in additional buildings at the same location 
in october  we named jane wasman as president  international 
ms 
wasman most recently has served as the company s chief  strategic development and general counsel 
in her new role  ms 
wasman will lead our efforts to identify and launch inlicensing and commercial opportunities outside the united states 
she will also be responsible for managing our collaboration with biogen idec in their international development and commercialization of fampyra prolonged release fampridine tablets 
ms 
wasman will also continue to lead our global strategic development and will retain the title of general counsel and corporate secretary 
outlook for financial guidance for we are providing the following guidance with respect to our financial performance we expect net revenue from the sale of ampyra to range from million to million 
we expect zanaflex tizanidine hydrochloride and ex us fampyra revenue to be million  which includes sales of branded zanaflex products  royalties from ex us fampyra and authorized generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsules sales  and million in amortized licensing revenue from the million payment we received from biogen idec in for fampyra ex us development and commercialization rights 
research and development expenses in are expected to range from million to million  excluding share based compensation charges 
research and development expenses in related to ampyra include proof of concept studies in cp and post stroke deficits  and sponsorship of investigator initiated studies 
additional expenses include clinical trials for ac and rhigm  continued development of diazepam nasal spray and ggf  as well as ongoing preclinical studies 
a substantial portion of the increase in research and development in over is related to diazepam nasal spray expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in are expected to range from million to million  excluding share based compensation charges 
sg a expenses will be primarily driven by commercial and administrative costs related to ampyra 
the majority of the increase in sg a in over is related to diazapam nasal spray expenses 
we expect to be cash flow positive in the range of sg a and r d expenditures for are non gaap financial measures because they exclude share based compensation charges 
non gaap financial measures are not an alternative for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  we believe the presentation of these non gaap financial measures  when viewed in conjunction with actual gaap results  provides investors with a more meaningful understanding of our projected operating performance because they exclude non cash charges that are substantially dependent on changes in the market price of our common stock 
we believe that non gaap financial measures that exclude share based compensation charges help indicate underlying trends in our 
table of contents business  and are important in comparing current results with prior period results and understanding expected operating performance 
also  our management uses non gaap financial measures that exclude share based compensation charges to establish budgets and operational goals  and to manage our business and to evaluate its performance 
key initiatives and expected developments our key initiatives and expected developments during are as follows biogen idec fampyra is commercially available in a number of european union countries and in canada  australia  new zealand and israel  and biogen idec anticipates making fampyra commercially available in additional markets in  as well as filing for regulatory approval in other countries 
targeted development milestones our goals with respect to our development pipeline in are as follows pending additional clinical and manufacturing data  we plan to submit a b type new drug application for diazepam nasal spray to the fda in  with potential fda approval and commercial launch in we anticipate that our current infrastructure can support sales and marketing of this product  and market planning is underway 
we completed enrollment for the second phase of our phase proof of concept clinical trial of dalfampridine in adults with cp 
this phase is a multi dose study including adults with cp  to evaluate both safety and efficacy 
we expect to announce topline results of this phase of the study in the second quarter of we have an open ind for rhigm for the treatment of ms and plan to initiate enrollment in a phase safety study in ms patients in the first half of we have completed analysis of the three month data from our phase clinical trial of ggf in heart failure patients  and we plan to present findings in a platform presentation at the american college of cardiology acc annual meeting in march a phase proof of concept clinical trial of dalfampridine in patients with post stroke deficits began in the second quarter of we expect to announce topline study results in the second quarter of we submitted a phase clinical trial protocol for ac for acute treatment of sci to the fda for review 
the protocol has been reviewed by the fda  and we are preparing to initiate the trial in the first half of funding of investigator initiated studies of ampyra in ms  focused on a range of functional deficits in ms and other neurological disorders  will be ongoing in 
table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue ampyra we recognize product sales of ampyra following shipment of product to our network of specialty pharmacy providers  kaiser and the specialty distributor to the va 
we recognized net revenue from the sale of ampyra to these customers of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this net revenue reflected a increase in our sale price for ampyra effective january  the net revenue increase was comprised of net volume increases of million and price increases and discount and allowance adjustments of million 
net revenue from sales of ampyra increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to our price increase and greater demand we believe due to  in part  the success of certain marketing programs such as our first step program 
effective january   we increased our sale price to our customers by 
discounts and allowances which are included as an offset in net revenue consist of allowances for customer credits  including estimated chargebacks  rebates  discounts  and returns 
discounts and allowances are recorded following shipment of ampyra tablets to our network of specialty pharmacy providers  kaiser and the specialty distributor to the va 
adjustments are recorded for estimated chargebacks  rebates  and discounts 
discounts and allowances also consist of discounts provided to medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause them to be subject to the medicare part d coverage gap ie  the donut hole 
payment of coverage gap discounts is required under the affordable care act  the health care reform legislation enacted in discounts and allowances may increase as a percentage of sales as we enter into managed care contracts in the future 
zanaflex we recognize product sales of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets using a deferred revenue recognition model where shipments to wholesalers are recorded as deferred revenue and only recognized as revenue when end user prescriptions of the product are reported 
we also recognize product sales on the transfer price of product sold for an authorized generic of zanaflex capsules during the year ended december  we recognized net revenue from the sale of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets of million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the commercial launch of generic versions of tizanidine hydrochloride capsules in february net product revenues also include million  which represents the sale of our zanaflex capsules authorized generic product to watson pharma a subsidiary of actavis for the year ended december  generic competition has caused a significant decline in net revenue of zanaflex capsules and is expected to cause the company s net revenue from zanaflex capsules to decline further in and beyond 
the decrease in net revenues was also the result of a disproportionate decrease in discounts and allowances due to the mix of customers continuing to purchase our product 
these customers receive higher levels of rebates and allowances 
discounts and allowances  which are included as an offset in net revenue  consist of allowances for customer credits  including estimated chargebacks  rebates  and discounts 
adjustments are recorded for estimated chargebacks  rebates  and discounts 
healthcare reform in march  healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the us this legislation contained several provisions that affected our business 
beginning in  the new law required drug manufacturers to provide a discount to medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause them to be subject to the medicare part d coverage gap ie  the donut hole 
these charges are included in our discounts and allowances 

table of contents in june  the united states supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the patient protection and affordable care act s mandate to purchase health insurance but rejected specific funding provisions that incentivized states to expand their current medicaid programs 
as a result of this ruling  we currently expect implementation of most of the major provisions of the act to continue 
changes to the affordable care act  or other federal legislation regarding health care access  financing  or delivery and other actions taken by individual states concerning the possible expansion of medicaid could impact our financial position or results of operations in the future 
license revenue we recognized million in amortized license revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to the million received from biogen idec in as part of our collaboration agreement 
we currently estimate the recognition period to be approximately years from the date of the collaboration agreement 
royalty revenue we recognized million and million in royalty revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively related to ex us sales of fampyra by biogen idec 
in  the german government implemented new legislation to manage pricing related to new drug products introduced within the german market through a review of each product s comparative efficacy 
biogen idec launched fampyra in germany in august during the three month period ended june   the government agency completed its comparative efficacy assessment of fampyra indicating a range of pricing below biogen idec s initial launch price  which was unregulated for the first months after launch consistent with german law 
the company recognized royalty revenue during a portion of based on the lowest point of the initially indicated german pricing authority range 
the company will recognize royalty revenue at the negotiated fixed price effective upon the signing of biogen idec s pricing agreement in  which is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of we recognized million in royalty revenue for the year ended december  related to the authorized generic sale of zanaflex capsules which started in february milestone revenue we recognized million in milestone revenue during the year ended december  as part of our ex us license agreement with biogen idec 
in july  biogen idec reached an agreement milestone when they received conditional approval from the european commission for fampyra prolonged release fampridine tablets for the improvement of walking in adult patients with ms with walking disability expanded disability status scale of

cost of sales for the year ended december  also consisted of million in inventory costs consisting of a charge of million related to recognized revenues and an inventory reserve charge of million  million in royalty fees based on net product shipments  and  in period costs related to freight and stability testing 
cost of milestone license revenue we recorded cost of license revenue of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of license revenue represents the recognition of a portion of the deferred million paid to alkermes in in connection with the million received from biogen idec as a result of our collaboration agreement 
we recorded cost of milestone revenue of million for the year ended december  cost of milestone revenue represents a payment to alkermes on the million milestone revenue received from biogen idec during the year ended december  in accordance with our worldwide license and supply agreement with alkermes 
for revenue recognition purposes  the related milestone revenue was considered to be substantive and was  therefore  recognized in its entirety in this period 
the corresponding cost of milestone revenue was also recognized in its entirety during the year ended december  we did not record milestone revenue or a corresponding cost of milestone revenue for the year ended december  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase was primarily due to a million net charge for neuronex expenses representing the million upfront payment  payments of million for research funding per the terms of the agreement we entered into with neuronex  and an expense of million  including payments of million  representing closing consideration for purchasing neuronex during the fourth quarter of less net assets acquired of million which were primarily the taxable amount of the neuronex net operating loss carryforwards 
the increase was also due to an increase in overall research and development staff  compensation and related expenses of million to support the various research and development initiatives 
the increase was also due to an increase of million in our life cycle management program for ampyra  a million increase in phase ggf preclinical and clinical trial expenses  a million increase in technical operations costs associated with our various pipeline initiatives  an increase of million related to our ac research  and an increase of  in research costs related to our chondroitinase program 
the increases in research and development expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by a decrease attributable to the medtronic ac license expense of million during and a decrease of million in preclinical expenses for the remyelinating antibodies program rhigm 

table of contents selling  general and administrative sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase was attributable to an increase in overall marketing  selling  distribution  and market research expenses for ampyra of million 
the increase was also related to an increase in overall compensation  benefits  and other selling expenses attributable to ampyra of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in selling  marketing  and distribution expenses for zanaflex capsules of million due to the introduction of generic competition in the marketplace 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was primarily related to an increase in staff  compensation and related expenses to support the overall growth of the organization of million and an increase in safety and surveillance expenses of million 
the overall increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to the zanaflex capsule patent infringement litigation of million  a decrease due to a gain in our put call liability related to the prf revenue interest agreement recorded in due to the zanaflex patent infringement trial court decision of million  and a decrease in post approval ampyra technical work of million 
other expense other expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million  or 
the decrease was due to a decrease in interest expense of million primarily related to the prf revenue interest agreement due to a decrease in zanaflex sales 
benefit provision for income taxes we recorded a million benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  as compared to a million provision for income taxes for the year ended december  the benefit for was primarily related to the release of our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize a benefit from these assets in the future 
this was partially offset by a provision of certain state and local income taxes 
the provision for was only comprised of the federal alternate minimum tax amt and gross receipts taxes for certain states 
we currently do not anticipate income tax benefits of this magnitude in the foreseeable future 
we expect that future periods will include taxes at a normalized rate relative to the federal and state statutory rates as compared to the effective rate for which was primarily driven by the benefit of the valuation allowance release 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities and adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to our level of past and future taxable income  the current and future expected utilization of tax benefit carryforwards  and any regulatory or legislative actions by relevant authorities with respect to the ampyra patents 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is required to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
positive the company is no longer in a three year cumulative pre tax loss position 
according to the guidance this is a significant factor to weigh heavily when looking at positive and negative evidence 
we achieved our second consecutive profitable year with a pre tax income of million 
our ampyra us patent no 
us  patent extends into our projections show that the deferred tax assets for our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits will be realized prior to their expiration 

table of contents negative there is an inherent risk in the ability to meet budgeted forecasts 
if we were to experience a future ownership change  the ability to utilize net operating losses may be limited  depending on the market value of the company at the time of any such ownership change 
we may acquire other compounds in the future  which may generate losses 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis  and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities and the progress of ongoing tax audits  if any

milestone revenue the company recognized million in milestone revenue for the three month period ended september  as part of its ex us license agreement with biogen idec 
in july  biogen idec reached an agreement milestone when they received conditional approval from the european commission for fampyra prolonged release fampridine tablets for the improvement of walking in adult patients with ms with walking disability expanded disability status scale of 
for revenue recognition purposes  the milestone revenue was considered to be substantive and was  therefore  recognized in its entirety in this period 
substantive uncertainty existed at the inception of the arrangement as to whether the milestone would be achieved because of the numerous variables  such as the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new products and the uncertainty involved with obtaining regulatory approval 
biogen idec leveraged acorda s us ampyra study results that contributed to the regulatory approval process 
therefore  the milestone was achieved based in part on acorda s past performance 
the milestone was also reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms of the collaboration arrangement 
license revenue the company recognized million and million in amortized license revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively related to the million received from biogen idec in as part of our collaboration agreement 
we currently estimate the recognition period to be approximately years from the date of the collaboration agreement

cost of sales ampyra we recorded cost of sales of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of sales for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in inventory costs related to recognized revenues 
cost of sales for the year ended december  also consisted of million in royalty fees based on net sales  million in amortization of intangible assets  and  in period costs related to packaging  freight and stability testing 
cost of sales for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in inventory costs related to recognized revenues 
in  our launch stock inventory was received in bulk form prior to regulatory approval  therefore  the manufacturing cost associated with this inventory was classified as research and development expense as there was no alternative future use prior to regulatory approval 
this expensed inventory represented approximately of the total cost basis of our launch stock inventory 
the remaining packaged portion of the inventory cost was received after regulatory approval and thus capitalized 
this reduction

payments to and interest expense related to the prf transaction discussed below in the section titled liquidity and capital resources do not impact the company s cost of sales 
cost of milestone license revenue we recorded cost of milestone and license revenue of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of milestone revenue represents a payment to elan on the million milestone revenue received from biogen idec in accordance with our worldwide license and supply agreement with elan 
for revenue recognition purposes  the related milestone revenue was considered to be substantive and was  therefore  recognized in its entirety in this period 
the corresponding cost of milestone revenue was also recognized in its entirety in this period 
cost of license revenue represents the recognition of a portion of the deferred million paid to elan in in connection with the million received from biogen idec as a result of our collaboration agreement 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase was attributable to an increase in clinical trial expenses of million related to post marketing clinical studies of ampyra  the medtronic ac license expense of million  an increase in overall research and development staff and compensation of million to support the various pipeline initiatives  an increase of million for work on our life cycle management program for ampyra  and an increase of million for our rhigm pipeline product 
the overall increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a decrease of million in clinical costs associated with the completion of our ms extension study and a decrease related to a reduction in expenses allocated to research and development of million for ampyra manufacturing and stability work that was classified as research and development for the year ended december  as it was incurred prior to fda approval of the drug 
the overall increase in research and development expense was also partially offset by a decrease of million in milestone payments paid during the year ended december  which were related to the filing of the ind for ggf two milestone payments were for  each 
table of contents payable to paion ag formerly cenes and one was for  payable to brigham and women s hospital 
finally  the overall increase in research and development expenses was further offset by a slight decrease in total ggf project costs of approximately  selling  general and administrative sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in overall ampyra sales and marketing expenses as compared to the launch year of ampyra 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense was partially offset by a net increase in zanaflex sales and marketing expense of  resulting from a sample inventory reserve charge and a bad debt expense charge offset by a decrease in overall zanaflex marketing spend 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was the result of a million increase in ampyra post approval regulatory expenses and other expenses related to supporting the growth of the overall organization including an increase of million for staff and compensation expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  also included an increase in the loss of our put call liability related to the prf revenue interest agreement of  a million increase in other expenses related to the zanaflex capsule patent infringement litigation and an increase in medical affairs expenses including educational programs of million 
other expense other expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately  or 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense of  principally related to the prf revenue interest agreement  a decrease in interest income of  resulting from lower average interest rates in  as well as realized loss on foreign currency exchange of  provision for income taxes we recorded a million provision for income taxes for the year ended december  which represents federal amt and gross receipts taxes for certain states 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of our common stock and preferred stock  payments received under our collaboration and licensing agreements  sales of ampyra and zanaflex capsules  and  to a lesser extent  from loans  government grants and our financing arrangement with prf 
we were cash flow positive in and  at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  compared to million at december  any investments classified as long term had maturity dates of no later than april  we believe that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments on hand  in addition to cash expected to be generated from operations  to fund our business plan  including our currently anticipated development pipeline activities in our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of revenue generated from sales of ampyra and zanaflex capsules  the continued progress of our research and development activities  the amount and timing of milestone or other payments payable under collaboration  license and acquisition agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or in license new products 
table of contents and compounds including the development costs relating to those products or compounds 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future operating requirements we will need to raise additional capital  reduce planned expenditures  or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
if we require additional financing in the future  we cannot assure you that it will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
financing arrangements in january  elan international services  ltd 
eis loaned us an aggregate of million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes to partly fund our research and development activities 
on december   elan transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with saints capital 
as of december   million of these promissory notes was outstanding  which amount includes accrued interest 
on december   we entered into a revenue interest assignment agreement with prf  a dedicated healthcare investment fund  pursuant to which we assigned to prf the right to a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
to secure our obligations to prf  we also granted prf a security interest in substantially all of our assets related to zanaflex 
our agreement with prf covers all zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement terminates earlier 
in november  we entered into an amendment to the revenue interest assignment agreement with prf 
under the terms of the amendment  prf paid us million in november an additional million was due to us if net revenues during the fiscal year equaled or exceeded million 
this milestone was met and the receivable was reflected in our december  financial statements 
under the terms of the amendment  we repaid prf million on december  and an additional million on december  since the net revenues milestone was met 
under the agreement and the amendment  prf is entitled to the following portion of zanaflex net revenues with respect to zanaflex net revenues up to and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million but less than and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  and with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues 
notwithstanding the foregoing  once prf has received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  prf will only be entitled to of zanaflex net revenues 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a liability as of december   referred to as the revenue interest liability  of approximately million 
we impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method and record a corresponding accrued interest liability 
the effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the life of the arrangement 
the interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors  including the level of zanaflex sales 
we currently estimate that the imputed interest rate associated with this liability will be approximately 
payments made to prf as a result of zanaflex sales levels will reduce the accrued interest liability and the principal amount of the revenue interest liability 
upon the occurrence of certain events  including if we experience a change of control  undergo certain bankruptcy events  transfer any of our interests in zanaflex other than pursuant to a license agreement  development  commercialization  co promotion  collaboration  partnering or similar agreement  transfer all or substantially all of our assets  or breach certain of the covenants  representations or warranties we make under the agreement  prf may i require us to repurchase the rights we sold them at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised or ii foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf 
except in the case of certain bankruptcy events  if prf exercises its right  which we refer to as prf s put option  to cause us 
table of contents to repurchase the rights we assigned to it  prf may not foreclose unless we fail to pay the put call price as required 
if we experience a change of control we have the right  which we refer to as our call option  to repurchase the rights we sold to prf at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised 
the put call price on a given date is the greater of i all payments made by prf to us as of such date  less all payments received by prf from us as of such date  and ii an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to prf of on all payments made by prf to us as of such date  taking into account the amount and timing of all payments received by prf from us as of such date 
we have determined that prf s put option and our call option meet the criteria to be considered an embedded derivative and should be accounted for as such 
therefore  we recorded a net liability of  as of december  related to the put call option to reflect its current estimated fair value 
this liability is revalued on an as needed basis to reflect any changes in the fair value and any gain or loss resulting from the revaluation is recorded in earnings 
during any period during which prf has the right to receive of zanaflex net revenues as defined in the agreement  then of the first million in payments from zanaflex sales we receive from wholesalers will be distributed to prf on a daily basis 
following the end of each fiscal quarter  if the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter exceeds the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive  prf will remit such excess to us 
if the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive during such quarter exceeds the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter  we will remit such excess to prf 
investment activities at december   cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments were approximately million  as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in a treasury money market fund and us treasury bonds 
also  we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  as compared to million as of december  our short term investments consist of us treasury bonds with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year 
the balance of these investments was million as of december   as compared to million as of december  our long term investments consist of us treasury bonds with original maturities greater than one year 
the balance of these investments was million as of december   as compared to zero as of december  net cash provided by operations net cash provided by operations was million and million for year ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to net income of million principally resulting from an increase in net product and royalty revenues  a non cash share based compensation expense of million  depreciation and amortization of million  amortization of net premiums and discounts on short term investments of million  and an asset impairment charge of  net cash provided by operations was also attributable to a net increase of million due to changes in working capital items primarily due to an increase of million in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other current liabilities resulting from payment timing  an increase of million in inventory held by the company and by others  and an increase of  in revenue interest liability interest payable 
these working capital increases were partially offset by an increase of million in accounts receivable  an increase of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and a net decrease of million in deferred product revenue 
cash provided by operations was partially offset by a non cash benefit of million primarily resulting from a release of our deferred tax valuation allowance  a decrease in deferred license revenue of million due to the amortization of the upfront collaboration payment received during the three month period ended september   an increase in other assets of approximately million resulting from the acquisition of neuronex tangible net assets of million which were primarily the taxable amount of net operating loss carryforwards  a decrease in deferred cost of license revenue of  due to the amortization of the payment made to elan related to this upfront collaboration payment  and a gain on our put call liability of

cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to net income of million principally resulting from a milestone revenue payment from biogen idec  a non cash share based compensation expense of million  an asset impairment charge of million  a decrease in inventory held by the company of million  amortization of net premiums and discounts on short term investments of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease in the noncurrent portion of deferred cost of license revenue of  and a  loss on our put call liability 
cash provided by operations was partially offset by a net decrease of million due to changes in working capital items primarily due to the payment of accruals and prepaid items during the year ended december  the offset to cash provided by operations was also attributable to a decrease in deferred license revenue of million due to the amortization of the upfront collaboration payment received during the three month period ended september  and an increase in accounts receivable of  net cash used in investing net used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to million in purchases of short term and long term investments  purchases of property and equipment of million  and purchases of intangible assets of million partially offset by million in proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments

contractual obligations and commitments our long term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
under certain supply agreements and other agreements with manufacturers and suppliers  we are required to make payments for the manufacture and supply of our clinical and approved products 
our major outstanding contractual obligations are for payments related to our convertible notes  our facility leases and our commitments to purchase inventory 
the following table summarizes our minimum significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years convertible note payable operating leases inventory purchase commitments total excludes prf principal and interest payments  due to uncertainty as to the amount and timing of such payments 
represents the remaining annual payments of principal and interest to be made on the convertible note payable to saints capital 
represents payments for new lease for ardsley  ny lease 
represents zanaflex and ampyra inventory commitments 
the ampyra inventory commitment is an estimate as the price paid for ampyra inventory is based on a percentage of the net product sales during the quarter alkermes ships 
table of contents inventory to us 
under our supply agreement with alkermes  we provide alkermes with monthly written month forecasts  and with annual written five year forecasts for our supply requirements of ampyra and two year forecasts for our supply requirements of zanaflex capsules 
in each of the five months for zanaflex and three months for ampyra following the submission of our written month forecast we are obligated to purchase the quantity specified in the forecast  even if our actual requirements are greater or less 
we have agreed to purchase at least of our annual requirements of ampyra from alkermes  unless alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet its requirements  for a percentage of net product sales and the quantity of product shipped by alkermes to us 
under certain agreements  we are required to pay royalties for the use of technologies and products in our r d activities and in the commercialization of products 
the amount and timing of any of the foregoing payments are not known due to the uncertainty surrounding the successful research  development and commercialization of the products 
under certain agreements  we are also required to pay license fees and milestones for the use of technologies and products in our r d activities and in the commercialization of products 
we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately million as part of our various agreements  including licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of december   such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements 
amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development  regulatory and commercial milestones 
there is uncertainty regarding the various activities and outcomes needed to reach these milestones  and they may not be achieved 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  primarily employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of critical accounting policies identifies the accounting policies that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this document 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition ampyra ampyra is available in the us only through a network of specialty pharmacy providers that provide the medication to patients by mail  kaiser permanente kaiser  which distributes ampyra to patients through a closed network of on site pharmacies  and amerisource specialty distribution healthcare  which is the exclusive specialty pharmacy distributor for the us department of veterans affairs va 
we do not recognize revenue from product sales until there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  the company has no obligation to bring about the sale of the product  and the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
we 
table of contents recognize product sales of ampyra following shipment of product to these customers 
our customers are contractually obligated to hold no more than an agreed number of days of inventory  ranging from between to days 
our net revenues represent total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated rebates and discounts 
these allowances are recorded for cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer that is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  are characterized as a reduction of revenue 
at the time product is shipped to our customers  an adjustment is recorded for estimated chargebacks and rebates 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
in determining the amounts of certain allowances and accruals  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
allowances for rebates and discounts are established based on the contractual terms with customers  historical trends  communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  as well as expectations about the market for each product and anticipated introduction of competitive products 
product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
based on the data that we receive from our customers  and returns experience of other specialty products with similar selling models  we have been able to make a reasonable estimate for product returns 
we revised our returns good policy in december and no longer accept returns of ampyra except for product damaged in shipping 
historically  it has been rare for us to have product damaged in shipping 
we will exchange product from inventory for product damaged in shipping 
zanaflex we apply the revenue recognition guidance in accounting standards codification asc  which among other criteria requires that future returns can be reasonably estimated in order to recognize revenue 
we have accumulated some sales history with zanaflex capsules  however  due to existing and potential generic competition and customer conversion from zanaflex tablets to zanaflex capsules  we cannot reasonably determine a return rate at this time and  thus  are not permitted to recognize revenue based on shipments to wholesalers 
as a result  we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model 
we continue to accumulate data and when we are able to reasonably estimate product returns based on this data and based on greater certainty regarding generic competition we will then begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
under our deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue following shipment of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets to our wholesale drug distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the inventory held by the wholesaler as a component of inventory 
we recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to an end user because once a prescription is filled the product cannot be returned 
we use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
when we receive the prescription data  we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales 
we then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold 
in addition to the prescription data we purchase  we also receive data that we use to monitor trends in sales from wholesalers to their customers 
we receive this data from an outside vendor on a monthly basis 
this data includes the number of bottles shipped from certain wholesalers to their customers 
we also compare our shipments to wholesalers to prescription reports to further assess inventory in the distribution channel on a monthly basis 
we use the wholesaler sales trend data and the wholesaler vs 
prescription comparison to better understand market conditions  but not as a basis for recognizing revenue 
we have not made any shipments as a result of incentives to our wholesalers and our policy is not to ship in excess of our wholesalers inventory levels maintained in the ordinary course of business 
our net revenues represent total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated discounts  rebates  and chargebacks 
these allowances are recorded for cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer that is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  
table of contents therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of income 
adjustments are recorded for estimated chargebacks  rebates  and discounts 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and are adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
allowances for chargebacks  rebates and discounts are established based on the contractual terms with customers  analysis of historical levels of discounts  chargebacks and rebates  communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  as well as expectations about the market for each product and anticipated introduction of competitive products 
product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
we accept returns of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets for six months prior to and twelve months after their expiration date 
we provide a credit to customers with whom we have a direct relationship or a cash payment to those with whom we do not have a direct relationship 
we do not exchange product from inventory for the returned product 
returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
in addition  we record a charge to cost of goods sold for the cost basis of the estimated product returns we believe may ultimately be realized at the time of product shipment to wholesalers 
we recognize this charge at the date of shipment since it is probable that we will receive a level of returned products  upon the return of such product we will be unable to resell the product considering its expiration dating  and  we can reasonably estimate a range of returns 
this charge represents the cost basis for the low end of the range of the company s estimated returns 
the charge to cost of goods sold amounted to  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
a change in this expense estimate would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s cost of sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we initiated a product recall for three lots of zanaflex capsules in february due to two reports of empty zanaflex capsules that had been distributed to pharmacies and sold to patients 
returns of this recalled product are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
some shipments of zanaflex capsules during the twelve month period ended december  were likely to replace this recalled product 
as of december  we received approximately million in recall returns which was charged directly against deferred revenue 
under the terms of our agreement with alkermes  they are responsible for the cost of replacing the inventory and any reasonable and actual costs and expenses incurred in connection with the recall 
discounts and allowances reserves for ampyra and zanaflex with respect to customer credits  including estimated rebates  wholesaler fees for services  discounts and returns have been established 
discounts and allowances are recorded following shipment of product and the appropriate reserves are credited 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate of historical experience and data points available and are adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
allowances for customer credits  rebates  wholesaler fees for services  and discounts are established based on contractual terms with customers and analyses of historical usage of these items 
the nature of our allowances and accruals requiring critical estimates  and the specific considerations it uses in estimating their amounts are as follows government chargebacks and rebates we contract for medicaid other government programs such as the federal supply schedule which commits us to providing favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
we also contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services to participate in the coverage gap discount program the program given rise by the affordable care act which closes the medicare part d donut hole 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for chargebacks and rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the chargebacks and rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent chargebacks and rebate experience 
our chargebacks and rebate accruals were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in our chargebacks and rebate 
table of contents allowances would have had an approximate million and  effect on our net revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
managed care contract rebates we contract with various managed care organizations including health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers in order to provide improved access to ampyra for patients that are members of such organizations 
these contracts stipulate that rebates and  in some cases  administrative fees  are paid to these organizations provided ampyra is represented as having been placed on a specific tier on the organizations drug formulary 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through managed care channels  we provide an allowance for managed care contract rebates 
we began to enter into these contracts during the three months ended december  we continue to monitor the sales trends and adjust the allowance on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
our managed care contract rebate accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
a change in our managed care contract rebate allowances would have had an approximate  and  effect on our net revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
copay mitigation rebates we offer copay mitigation to commercially insured patients who have coverage for ampyra in accordance with applicable law and are responsible for a cost share regardless of financial need income status 
the copay mitigation program is intended to reduce the patient s financial responsibility for ampyra to a specified dollar amount 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to actual copay assistance provided  we provide an allowance for copay mitigation rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
our copay mitigation rebate accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
a change in our managed care contract rebate allowances would have had an approximate  and  effect on our net revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
cash discounts we sell ampyra directly to our network of specialty pharmacies  kaiser and the specialty distributor to the us department of veterans affairs va and zanaflex directly to wholesalers and generally provide invoice discounts for prompt payment 
we estimate our cash discounts based on the terms offered to its customers 
discounts are accrued based on historical usage rates at the time of product shipment 
we adjust accruals based on actual activity as necessary 
cash discounts are typically settled with wholesalers within days after the end of each calendar month 
our cash discounts accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
a change in our cash discounts would have had an approximate  and  effect on our net revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
product returns prior to december   our specialty pharmacies had the right to return any unopened product during the eight month period beginning two months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending six months after the labeled expiration date 
once product had been prescribed  it was no longer eligible for return 
if specialty pharmacies returned product  they were to be given a credit against amounts owed to us 
we did not replace returned product with new product unless it had been damaged in shipping 
as of the year ended december   the company had not received any product returns of ampyra 
as of december   we changed our returned goods policy with respect to ampyra and will no longer accept returned product with the exception of that damaged in shipping 
therefore  we reversed the majority of its returns accrual for ampyra during the three month period ended december  our returns accrual was  and  at december  and december   respectively 
we record zanaflex capsule and tablet revenue based on a deferred revenue model and recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to an end user because once a prescription is filled the product cannot be returned 
therefore  there is no returns reserve for zanaflex 

table of contents data fees and fees for service payable to wholesalers we have contracted with the specialty pharmacies not including the specialty distributor to the va to obtain transactional data related to ampyra in order to ascertain a better understanding of our selling channel as well as patient activity and utilization by the medicaid program and other government agencies and managed care organizations 
these contracts stipulate that the specialty pharmacies provide data directly to us  as well as indirectly through ampyra patient support services apss  which in turn provides data to us 
we pay a data fee to the specialty pharmacies for each line of data provided and the company provides an allowance for these data fees 
a line of data is defined as data pertaining to a single prescription 
we pay a fee for service to certain wholesalers on contractually determined rates for distribution  inventory management and data reporting services 
we estimate our fee for service accruals and allowances based on sales to each wholesaler and the applicable contracted rate 
our fee for service expenses are accrued at the time of product shipment and are typically settled with the wholesalers within days after the end of each respective quarter 
our data fee and fee for service accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
a change in our data fee and fee for service allowances would have had an approximate  and  effect on our net revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have adjusted our allowances in the past based on actual experience  and we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances and accruals in the future 
the historical adjustments have not been significant to operations 
we continually monitor our allowances and accruals and makes adjustments when we believe actual experience may differ from its estimates 
the allowances included in the table below reflect these adjustments

if an element shall be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes  the revenue recognition principles most appropriate for that element are applied to determine when revenue shall be recognized 
if an element shall not be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes  the revenue recognition principles most appropriate for the bundled group of elements are applied to determine when revenue shall be recognized 
payments received in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
milestones and royalties in order to determine the revenue recognition for contingent milestones  we evaluate the contingent milestones using the criteria as provided by the financial accounting standards boards fasb guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition 
at the inception of a collaboration agreement we evaluate if payments are substantive 
the criteria requires that i we determine if the milestone is commensurate with either its performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of value resulting from our activities to achieve the milestone  ii the milestone be related to past performance  and iii the milestone be reasonable relative to all deliverable and payment terms of the collaboration arrangement 
if these criteria are met then the contingent milestones can be considered as substantive milestones and will be recognized as revenue in the period that the 
table of contents milestone is achieved 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of various research and collaboration agreements 
license revenue and cost of license revenue under the collaboration agreement with biogen idec  we were entitled to a non refundable upfront payment of million as of june   the date of the agreement  which was received on july  as a result of such payment to us  million became payable by us to elan under our existing agreements with elan 
these agreements obligate us to pay an amount equal to of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to ampyra or other aminopyridine products 
we estimate the revenue recognition period for the upfront payment that we received from biogen idec  and for any milestone payments made to us by biogen idec  and for the corresponding payments that we make to elan  to be approximately years from the date of the receipt of payment from biogen 
ampyra inventory prior to regulatory approval of ampyra in the three month period ended march   we incurred expenses for the manufacture of several batches of ampyra that ultimately became available to support the commercial launch of this drug candidate 
until the necessary initial regulatory approval was received  we charged all such amounts to research and development expenses 
as a result  our initial sales of ampyra resulted in higher gross margins than if the inventory costs had not previously been expensed 
upon regulatory approval of ampyra  we began capitalizing the commercial inventory costs associated with manufacturing with alkermes plc alkermes  formerly elan corporate  plc elan  and at its second manufacturer  patheon 
during the third quarter of  alkermes acquired the elan business that supplies our ampyra inventory 
the cost of ampyra inventory manufactured by alkermes is based on specified prices calculated as a percentage of net product sales of the product shipped by alkermes to acorda 
in the event alkermes does not manufacture the products  alkermes is entitled to a compensating payment for the quantities of product provided by the alternative manufacturer 
this compensating payment is included in our inventory balances 
cost of sales ampyra cost of sales consists of cost of inventory  expense due to inventory reserves when necessary  royalty expense  milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with our agreement with alkermes and well as the capitalization of milestone achievements with the canadian spinal research organization csro during the three months ended march   packaging costs  freight and required inventory stability testing costs 
our inventory costs  royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into with alkermes 
these agreements require us to pay alkermes a percentage of our net selling price for each inventory lot purchased from alkermes 
the cost for each lot is calculated based on an agreed upon estimated net selling price which is based on an actual historical net selling price 
at the end of each quarter  we perform a calculation to adjust the inventory value for any lots received in the current quarter to that quarter s actual net selling price 
this payment is recorded as an adjustment to inventory as well as an accrual on our balance sheet and is required to be paid within days of the quarter end 
in the event we have sold any inventory purchased from alkermes during that respective quarter  we would also record an adjustment to the cost of goods sold and an additional accrual on the balance sheet to be paid to alkermes 
the agreement with alkermes allows us to purchase up to of our annual inventory requirements from an alternative manufacturer but stipulates a compensating payment to be made to alkermes for any inventory purchased from this alternative manufacturer 
this payment is determined at the end of the quarter in which any new lots have been purchased exclusive from alkermes using the actual net selling price for the respective quarter net of an agreed upon amount as stipulated by the alkermes agreement 
this payment is recorded as an adjustment to inventory as well as an accrual on our balance sheet 

table of contents zanaflex cost of sales consists of cost of inventory  expense due to inventory reserves when necessary  royalty expense  milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with the zanaflex acquisition prior to  intangible write off expense in  packaging costs  freight and required inventory stability testing costs 
our inventory costs  royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into in connection with our zanaflex acquisition 
any payments we make to prf in connection with the revenue interest assignment transaction entered into in december will not constitute royalty expense or otherwise affect our cost of sales

research and development we are developing diazepam nasal spray  which we acquired in december  for the treatment of selected  refractory patients with epilepsy  on stable regimens of antiepileptic drugs  or aeds  who require intermittent use of diazepam to control bouts of increased seizure activity also known as cluster or acute repetitive seizures  or ars 
pending additional clinical and manufacturing data  we plan to submit an nda to the fda for diazepam nasal spray in we are also studying dalfampridine to improve a range of functional impairments  in addition to walking disability  caused by ms  as well as its potential use in other neurological conditions  including cerebral palsy and post stroke deficits 
in addition  we have several research and development programs focused on distinct therapeutic approaches to restoring neurologic and or cardiac function 
we are developing clinical stage compounds ac for acute treatment of sci  ggf for the treatment of heart failure  and rhigm  a remyelenating monoclonal antibody  for the treatment of ms 
ggf is also being investigated in preclinical studies as a treatment for neurological conditions such as stroke and sci 
chondroitinase  an enzyme that encourages nerve plasticity in sci  is in preclinical development 
we consider the active management and development of our research  preclinical and clinical pipeline an important component of the long term process of introducing new products 
we manage our overall research  development and inlicensing efforts in a highly disciplined manner designed to advance only high quality  differentiated agents into clinical development 
the duration of each phase of research and preclinical and clinical development and the probabilities of success for approval of drug candidates entering clinical development will be impacted by a variety of factors  including the quality of the molecule  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition and commercial viability 
due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and the early stage nature of our pipeline development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty completion dates  the proportion of our r d investments assigned to any one program or to the future cash inflows from these potential programs 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits and share based compensation for research and development personnel  costs of facilities and equipment that have no alternative future use  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to contract research organizations cros in conjunction with preclinical studies  fees paid to organizations in conjunction with contract manufacturing  costs of materials used in research and development  upfront and milestone payments under contractual agreements  consulting  license and sponsored research fees paid to third parties  and depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products 
for those studies that we administer ourselves  we account for our clinical study costs by estimating the patient cost per visit in each clinical trial and recognizing this cost as visits occur  beginning when the patient enrolls in the trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and patient related costs  including 
table of contents laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial 
cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial  and the length of the treatment period for each patient 
for those studies for which we use a cro  we account for our clinical study costs according to the terms of the cro contract 
these costs include upfront  milestone and monthly expenses as well as reimbursement for pass through costs 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accrual  such changes in estimate may be a material change in our clinical study accrual  which could also materially affect our results of operations 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred except when we are accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
in these cases  these payments are capitalized at the time of payment and expensed ratable over the period the research and development activity is performed 
we use our employee and infrastructure resources across several projects  and many of our costs are not attributable to an individually named project  but are broadly applicable research projects 
accordingly  we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
unallocated costs are represented as operating expenses in the table below 
the following table shows  for each of the years ended  i the total third parties expenses for clinical development  preclinical research and development  on a project by project basis  ii our unallocated research and development operating expenses  and iii acquisitions  licenses and milestone payments  on a project by project basis in thousands year ended december  preclinical and clinical development contract expenses ampyra contract expenses diazepam nasal spray contract expenses ggf contract expenses rhigm contract expenses ac contract expenses chondroitinase research and development operating expenses acquisitions  licenses and milestones diazepam nasal spray ggf ac other total research and development year ended includes approximately million for pre approval expensed launch stock inventory for ampyra 
with respect to previously established clinical study accruals in prior periods and for the twelve month period ended december  we did not make any significant adjustments to our clinical study costs 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include personnel costs  related benefits and share based compensation for our sales  managed markets and marketing personnel  the cost of ampyra and zanaflex sales and marketing initiatives as well as the pre market marketing costs for future products 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  related benefits and share based compensation for personnel serving executive  finance  medical affairs  safety  business development  legal  quality assurance  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development or sales and marketing expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 

table of contents other income expense interest income consists of income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
interest expense consists of interest expense related to our revenue interest liability and accrued interest on our convertible notes 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on pre tax earnings  existing statutory tax rates  and permanent adjustments affecting taxable income 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in accordance with asc  we account for income taxes by the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we had million of net deferred tax assets  which included the effects of net operating loss carryforwards of million  tax credits of million and other items 
for the three months ended december   we reduced our valuation allowance in full because we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
when considering the reversal of the valuation allowance  we consider the level of past and anticipated future taxable income and the utilization of the carryforwards 
based upon these considerations  we reduced our valuation allowance in full 
this valuation adjustment resulted in a benefit from income taxes for the year ended december  we expect that future periods will include income taxes at a higher effective rate 
revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities and adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to our level of past and future taxable income  the current and future expected utilization of tax benefit carryforwards  and any regulatory or legislative actions by relevant authorities with respect to the ampyra patents 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is required to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
positive the company is no longer in a three year cumulative pre tax loss position 
according to the guidance this is a significant factor to weigh heavily when looking at positive and negative evidence 
we achieved our second consecutive profitable year with a pre tax income of million 
our ampyra us patent no 
us  patent extends into our projections show that the deferred tax assets for our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits will be realized prior to their expiration 
negative there is an inherent risk in the ability to meet budgeted forecasts 

table of contents if we were to experience a future ownership change  the ability to utilize net operating losses may be limited  depending on the market value of the company at the time of any such ownership change 
we may acquire other compounds in the future  which may generate losses 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis  and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities and the progress of ongoing tax audits  if any 
share based compensation we account for stock options and restricted stock granted to employees and non employees by recognizing the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions in the financial statements at their fair values 
we estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the black scholes closed form option pricing model based on assumptions for the expected term of the stock options  expected volatility of our common stock  prevailing interest rates  and an estimated forfeiture rate 
we have based our current assumptions on the following assumption method of estimating estimated expected term of options historical term of our options based on exercise data expected volatility historic volatility of our common stock risk free interest rate yields of us treasury securities corresponding with the expected life of option grants forfeiture rates historical forfeiture data of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of the employees and expected performance of our common stock 
increases in the term and the volatility of our common stock will generally cause an increase in compensation expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  grants receivable  convertible notes payable  accounts payable  and put call liability 
the estimated fair values of all of our financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts at december  we have cash equivalents and short term and long term investments at december   which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as our interest rates change 
due to the nature of our investments in money market funds and us treasury bonds  the carrying value of our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments approximate their fair value at december  our investments designated as long term as of december  had maturity dates no later than april  at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term investments which had an average interest rate of approximately 
we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity and to meet operating needs 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 

table of contents however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments
