overview we are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the united states us  canada  the united kingdom uk  and brazil 
we also provide vehicle remarketing service in the united arab emirates uae  germany and spain 
we provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our virtual bidding second generation internet auction style sales technology  which we refer to as vb vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions  charities  car dealerships  fleet operators and vehicle rental companies 
we sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers  rebuilders  repair licensees  used vehicle dealers and exporters and  at certain locations  to the general public 
the majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made 
we offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process  minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price 
in the us and canada north america  the us and brazil we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage 
in the uk  we operate both on a principal basis  purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account  and as an agent 
in germany and spain  we derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies 
our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers  transportation revenue  purchased vehicle revenues  and other remarketing services 
revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or  under our percentage incentive program  or pip  where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price 
under the consignment  or fixed fee  program  we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation 
although sometimes included in the consignment fee  we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility  storage of the vehicle  and other incidental costs 
under the consignment programs  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue  not the actual sales price gross proceeds 
sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles  storage  loading and annual registration 
transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 
purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the uk operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fuel  equipment maintenance and repair  and costs of vehicles sold under purchase contracts 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management  accounting  data processing  sales personnel  human resources  professional fees  research and development and marketing expenses 
acquisitions and new operations we have experienced significant growth in facilities as we have acquired facilities and established four new facilities since the beginning of fiscal through july  all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers  we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by our facilities 
we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in north america  the uk  the uk  germany  spain  and brazil  and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers 
the following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from august  through july  locations acquisition or greenfield date geographic service area homestead  florida greenfield september united states hartford city  indiana acquisition march united states atlanta  georgia greenfield august united states burlington  north carolina greenfield july united states webster  new hampshire greenfield september united states gainesville  georgia acquisition may united states davison  michigan acquisition may united states ionia  michigan acquisition may united states kincheloe  michigan acquisition may united states salvage parent  inc acquisition may united states birmingham  england acquisition march united kingdom edmonton  canada acquisition may canada calgary  canada acquisition may canada dubai  uae 
acquisition august united arab emirates embu  brazil acquisition november brazil pirapora  brazil acquisition november brazil osasco  brazil acquisition november brazil castelo branco  brazil acquisition november brazil locations acquisition or greenfield date geographic service area vila jaguara  brazil acquisition november brazil ettlingen  germany acquisition november germany cordoba  spain acquisition june spain salvage parent  inc conducts business primarily as quad city salvage auction  crashed toys  and desert view auto auctions 
combined  these businesses operate at locations in states 
the period to period comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions  new openings  weather and product introductions during such periods 
in particular  we have certain contracts inherited through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal  purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 
it is our intention  where possible  to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods 
changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages 
in addition to growth through business acquisitions  we seek to increase revenues and profitability by  among other things  i acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets  ii pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements  iii expanding our service offerings to sellers and members  and iv expanding the application of vb into new markets 
in addition  we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures  integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel  when necessary 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the following table sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands  except percentages percentage of revenue percentage of revenue service revenues vehicle sales service revenues 
service revenues were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  above fiscal the growth came from i our international expansion during the year into germany  spain  the united arab emirates and brazil which represented million  ii the acquisition of salvage parent  inc which closed on may  and represents million  iii growth in the uk of million driven by increased revenue per car  and  iv growth in north america of million 
the growth in north america was driven primarily by increased volume as revenue per car remained relatively flat 
the increase in volume came from i hurricane sandy  as the major storm produced an extraordinary volume of flood damaged vehicles  ii market share gains as we saw the full year impact of the exclusive provider contract entered into with a major insurance company at the end of fiscal  and  iii what we believe to be a general increase in the overall salvage market as we believe there has been an increase in salvage frequency 
salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair 
trends in salvage frequency are driven by the relationship between repairs costs  used car values and auction returns 
the increase in salvage frequency was driven  we believe  by the decline in used cars values relative to repair costs 
used car values are determined by many factors including the used car supply  which is tied directly to new car sales  and the average age of cars on the road 
new cars sales grew on a year over year basis increasing the supply of used cars and the average age of a car on the road continued to grow 
these factors  among others  lead to a decline in used car values on a year over year basis 
during the same period the average cost to repair a car increased 
the factors that influence repair costs  used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements 
accordingly  we cannot predict future trends in salvage frequency 
vehicle sales 
we have certain contracts with insurance companies in which we act as a principal  purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account 
we also purchase vehicles in the open market  primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account 
vehicle sales revenues were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  above fiscal the increase came from i our international expansion during the year into germany  spain  the united arab emirates and brazil which represented million  ii the acquisition of salvage parent  inc which represented million  iii growth in the uk of million and driven primarily by increased volume from insurance sellers in the uk and increased open market purchase activity from the general public  and iv growth in north america of million driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity 
yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment  were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  above fiscal the growth came from i our international expansion during the year into germany  spain  the united arab emirates and brazil which represented million  ii the acquisition of salvage parent  inc which represented million  iii growth in the uk of million driven by increased volume associated with general salvage market growth  and iv growth in north america of million 
the growth in north america was driven by increases in both the costs to process each car and in volume million and million  respectively 
the increase in volume came from i hurricane sandy  as the major storm produced an extraordinary volume of flood damaged vehicles  ii market share gains as we saw the full year impact of the exclusive provider contract entered into with a major insurance company at the end of fiscal  and  iii what we believe to be a general increase the in overall salvage market as we believe there has been an increase in salvage frequency  which is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that the insurance companies salvage rather than repair 
the increase in the cost to process each car was driven primarily by the abnormal costs for temporary storage facilities  premiums for subhaulers  labor costs incurred from overtime  travel and lodging  and equipment associated with hurricane sandy 
there was also an increase in the normal cost to process each car driven by growth in normal subhaul  labor  equipment and titling costs 
included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
the increase in yard operation depreciation and amortization expense is due primarily to accelerated depreciation from the shorter useful lives of our data center assets 
cost of vehicle sales 
the cost of vehicles sold was million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase came from i our international expansion during the year into germany  spain  the united arab emirates and brazil which represented million  ii the acquisition of salvage parent  inc which represented million  and iii growth in the uk and north america of million and driven primarily by increased volume from insurance sellers in the uk and increased open market purchase activity from the general public in both the uk and in north america 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment  were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the growth came from i our international expansion during the year into germany  spain  the united arab emirates and brazil representing million  ii the acquisition of salvage parent  inc which closed on may  and represents million  iii relocation costs of million  and iv growth in north america of million 
the growth in north america was driven primarily by increased costs associated with new product development  the rollout of a new worldwide erp operating platform and the transition costs associated with the outsourcing of our it infrastructure and support which totaled million  as well as an overall growth in labor costs  professional services and facilities costs associated with domestic and international expansion 
included in general and administrative costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
other expense income 
total other expense was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
interest expense decreased million as a result of principal payments of long term debt  which is further described in the notes to consolidated financial statements note long term debt  which is incorporated herein by reference 
other income  net  increased million due primarily to the gain on sale of assets 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the change in the overall tax rate was driven by fluctuations in the us state taxes and the geographical allocation of our taxable income 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues the following table sets forth information on revenue by class in thousands  except percentages percentage of revenue percentage of revenue service revenues vehicle sales service revenues 
service revenues were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  above fiscal growth in unit volume generated million in additional service revenue relative to last year and was driven primarily by growth in the number of units sold on behalf of franchise and independent car dealerships  new and expanded contracts with insurance companies and the migration from the principal model to the agency model in the uk growth in the average revenue per car sold generated million in additional revenue over last year and was driven by an increase in the average vehicle auction selling price as over of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle 
we believe the increase in the average vehicle auction selling price was driven primarily by i the year over year increase in commodity pricing as we believe that commodity pricing  particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies  has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling  ii the general increase in used car pricing  which we believe has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles which are repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user  iii the mix of cars sold as the insurance company cars  which on average command a lower average selling price than non insurance cars  represented a lower portion of all cars sold  and iv in the uk  the beneficial impact of vb which we introduced in and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide 
we cannot determine the impact of the movement of these influences as we cannot determine which vehicles are sold to the end user or for scrap  dismantling  retailing or export 
nor can we predict their future movement 
accordingly  we cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing  used car pricing  product sales mix  and the introduction of vb in the uk had on the selling price of vehicles and ultimately on service revenue 
the average dollar to pound exchange rate was dollars to the pound and dollars to the pound for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and led to a decrease in service revenue of million 
vehicle sales 
we have assumed certain contracts through our uk acquisitions that require us to act as a principal  purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account 
vehicle sales revenues were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  above fiscal the increase in vehicle sales revenue was due to the growth in the average selling price of vehicles which resulted in increased revenue of million 
the growth in the average selling price per unit was primarily due to i the increase in commodity pricing  particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies  which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling and ii in the uk  the continuing beneficial impact of vb which we introduced to the uk in and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide 
we cannot determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap  dismantling  retailing  or export and  accordingly  cannot quantify the specific impact of commodity pricing nor can we isolate the impact that vb had on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold in the uk the decline in volume resulted primarily from the migration of certain contracts in the uk from the principal model to the agency model and resulted in a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of million 
the detrimental impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate was million 
yard operation expenses 
yard operation expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment  were million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  above fiscal the increase was driven by volume  which led to an increase of million as we processed more vehicles in fiscal than in fiscal this increase was offset by a reduction in operating costs of million driven by the decline in the cost to process each car 
there was a detrimental impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate of million 
included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
cost of vehicle sales 
the cost of vehicles sold was million during fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in the cost per unit sold represented a million increase relative to last year 
unit volume decrease led to a decrease of million 
the beneficial impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate was million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of less than million  or 
the beneficial impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in the british pound to us dollar exchange rate was million 
included in general and administrative costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were million and million for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
impairment 
during the year ended july   we recorded an impairment of million associated with the write down to fair market value of certain assets  primarily real estate  computer hardware and our fleet of private aircraft which have been removed from operations and  if not disposed of  are reflected in assets held for sale on the balance sheet 
other expense income 
total other expense was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  an increase of million  or 
interest expense increased million as a result of increased borrowing under the new credit facility  which is further described in the notes to consolidated financial statements note long term debt  which is incorporated herein by reference 
other income  net  increased million due primarily to the gain on sale of assets 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the change in tax rates was primarily driven by the geographical allocation of income and the application of new elective tax law starting in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary source of working capital is net income 
accordingly  factors affecting net income are the principal factors affecting the generation of working capital 
those primary factors i seasonality  ii market wins and losses  iii supplier mix  iv accident frequency  v salvage frequency  vi change in market share of our existing suppliers  vii commodity pricing  viii used car pricing  ix foreign currency exchange rates  x product mix  and xi contract mix to the extent appropriate  are discussed in the results of operations and risk factors sections of this annual report on form k 
potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
a potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity 
however  with respect to the issuance of equity or debt  we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and  if available  if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us 
historically  we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations  public offerings of common stock  the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing 
our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers fees  members fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales 
our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and  consequently  the number of cars deemed as totaled by the insurance companies 
during the winter months  most of our facilities process to more vehicles than at other times of the year 
this increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 
as of july   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits and funds invested in money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in cash was due primarily to the million for capital expenditures and acquisitions and million in payments on outstanding debt  which were offset by a reduction in share repurchase activity  proceeds from stock option exercises and increased accounts payable balances 
we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we experience significant growth in the future  we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 
as of july   million of the million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal the decrease was driven in part by increases in prepaid and other assets of million  increased accounts receivable of million  and increased income taxes receivable of million offset by increases in accounts payable of million 
the remaining decrease of million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million to million during fiscal when compared to fiscal the decrease was driven in part by increased deferred income taxes of million  a million increase in vehicle pooling costs as a result of the adoption of asu in fiscal offset by an increase in net income of million 
the remaining decrease of million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items 
investing activities capital expenditures excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities  opening and improving facilities  software development  and acquiring yard equipment 
we continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations 
acquisition related capital expenditures for the year ended july  were million primarily for the acquisition of salvage parent  inc and acquisitions for international expansion 
we have no material commitments for future capital expenditures as of july included in capital expenditures for the year ended july  are capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software 
the capitalized costs were million  million  and million for the years ended july   and  respectively 
if  at any time  it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit  the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be impaired 
during the fiscal year ended july   we used million in cash primarily for the purchases of hewitt and barodge auto pool 
during fiscal  we sold our corporate headquarters building in fairfield  california for million and entered into a twenty one month lease term 
during fiscal  we terminated this lease 
financing activities in fiscal  and  we generated million  million and million  respectively  through the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  and  we generated million  million and million  respectively  through the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  and  we used million  million and million  respectively  for the repurchase of common stock 
on september   our board of directors approved a million share increase in the stock repurchase program that was originally implemented in  bringing the total current authorization to million shares 
the repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
no time limit has been placed on the duration of the stock repurchase program 
subject to applicable securities laws  such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time 
for the fiscal year ended july   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 
for the fiscal year ended july   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 
for the fiscal year ended july   we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 
as of july   the total number of shares repurchased under the program was  and  shares were available for repurchase under our program 
additionally  on january   we completed a tender offer to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
our directors and executive officers were expressly prohibited from participating in the tender offer by our board of directors under our insider trading policy 
in connection with the tender offer  we accepted for purchase  shares of our common stock 
the shares accepted for purchase are comprised of the  shares we offered to purchase and an additional  shares purchased pursuant to our right to purchase additional shares up to of our outstanding shares 
the shares purchased as a result of the tender offer are not part of our repurchase program 
the purchase of the shares of common stock was funded by the proceeds relating to the issuance of long term debt 
the dilutive earnings per share impact of all repurchased shares on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year ended july  is less than 
in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year certain executive officers exercised stock options through cashless exercises 
in the first  second and third quarters of fiscal year and the second quarter of fiscal year certain executive officers exercised stock options through cashless exercises 
a portion of the options exercised were net settled in satisfaction of the exercise price and federal and state minimum statutory tax withholding requirements 
we remitted million  million and million  in fiscal  and  respectively  to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employees minimum statutory withholding requirements 
the exercises are summarized in the following table period options exercised exercise price shares net settled for exercise shares withheld for taxes net shares to employee share price for withholding tax withholding in s fy q fy q fy q fy q fy q fy q fy q shares withheld for taxes are treated as a repurchase of shares for accounting purposes but do not count against our stock repurchase program 
contractual obligations we lease certain domestic and foreign facilities  and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in addition to the minimum future lease commitments presented  the leases generally require the company to pay property taxes  insurance  maintenance and repair costs which are not included in the table because we have determined these items are not material 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of july  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other long term debt including current portion interest payments on long term debt including current portion operating leases capital leases tax liabilities total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period commercial commitments total less than year years years more than years other letters of credit contractual obligations consist of future non cancelable minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases  used in the normal course of business 
tax liabilities include the long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions 
at this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
commercial commitments consist primarily of letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions 
credit facilities on december   we entered into an amended and restated credit facility agreement credit facility  which supersedes our previously disclosed credit agreement with bank of america  na bank of america 
the credit facility is an unsecured credit agreement providing for i a million revolving credit facility  including a million alternative currency borrowing sublimit and a million letter of credit sublimit revolving credit and ii a term loan facility of million term loan 
on january  the full million provided under the term loan was borrowed 
on september   we amended the credit agreement increasing the amount of the term loan facility from million to million 
on march   we amended the credit agreement to increase the net leverage ratio at which restrictive spending covenants are introduced from to the term loan  which at july  had million outstanding  amortizes million each quarter beginning december  with all outstanding borrowings due on december  all amounts borrowed under the term loan may be prepaid without premium or penalty 
during the year ended july   we made principal repayments of million 
we currently have million deferred financing costs in other assets as of july  amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest  subject to certain restrictions  at a fluctuating rate based on i the eurocurrency rate  ii the federal funds rate  or iii the prime rate as described in the credit facility 
we have entered into two interest rate swaps see note derivatives and hedging to exchange our variable interest rate payments commitment for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan balance  which at july   totaled million 
a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility  at a rate per annum equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
at july   our interest rate is the eurocurrency rate plus the applicable rate 
the applicable rate can fluctuate between and depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries 
the carrying amount of the credit facility is comprised of borrowing under which interest accrues under a fluctuating interest rate structure 
accordingly  the carrying value approximates fair value at july  and is classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date  which is december  the credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit 
the commitment fee ranges from to per annum depending on our leverage ratio 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit at the end of the period 
the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and may place certain business operating restrictions on us relating to  among other things  indebtedness  liens and other encumbrances  investments  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  dividends and distributions and redemptions of capital stock 
in addition  the credit facility provides for the following financial covenants i earnings before income tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda  ii leverage ratio  iii interest coverage ratio  and iv limitations on capital expenditures

we are in compliance with all covenants as of july  please refer to the tables under the caption contractual obligations above in the long term debt including current portion section for the payment schedule 
restructuring we relocated our corporate headquarters to dallas  texas in certain functions currently performed at the fairfield  california location may transition to the corporate headquarters over the next few years 
we may incur additional expenses in future fiscal years 
the restructuring related costs are as follows in thousands years ended july  general and administrative severance relocation total general and administrative yard operations severance relocation impairment total yard operations off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k promulgated under the exchange act 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to vehicle pooling costs  self insured reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  revenue recognition  stock based compensation  long lived asset impairment calculations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
the following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we discuss  where appropriate  sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur 
revenue recognition we provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer 
these services include the ability to use our internet sales technology and vehicle delivery  loading  title processing  preparation and storage 
we evaluate multiple element arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements 
the services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller s behalf and  under most of our current north american contracts  collecting the proceeds from the member 
pre sale services  including towing  title processing  preparation and storage  as well as sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting 
the revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service  net of applicable rebates or allowances 
for certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle  the revenue associated with the pre sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and determinable 
the selling price of each service is determined based on management s best estimate and allotted based on the relative selling price method 
vehicle sales  where vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf  are recognized on the sale date  which is typically the point of high bid acceptance 
upon high bid acceptance  a legal binding contract is formed with the member  and we record the gross sales price as revenue 
we also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle  charging a separate fee for each service 
each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multiple element arrangement 
we have concluded that the sale and the post sale services are separate units of accounting 
the fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale  and the fees for the post sale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method 
we also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program  which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  and relist and late payment fees  which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member 
no provision for returns has been established  as all sales are final with no right of return  although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of non performance by our members or sellers 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate consideration in an arrangement using its best estimate of selling prices bsp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
we allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting containing multiple deliverables 
estimated selling prices are determined using management s best estimate 
significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends  pricing customization and practices  and profit objectives for the services 
prior to the adoption of asu  we used the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when the fair value of delivered items had not been established and deferred all arrangement consideration when fair value was not available for undelivered items 
fair value of financial instruments we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles 
in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  as amended by accounting standards update  we consider fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions 
this framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value level i observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets 
level ii inputs other than quoted prices included within level i that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
interest rate hedges are valued at exit prices obtained from the counter party 
level iii inputs that are generally unobservable 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate the amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements  which included cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values as of july  and july   due to the short term nature of those instruments  and are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
cash equivalents are classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments 
see note long term debt for fair value disclosures related to our long term debt 
vehicle pooling costs we defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us  but not sold as of the balance sheet date 
we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period  the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period 
the primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs  labor  and vehicle processing 
if our allocation factors change  then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future 
these costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis 
given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation in an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs 
we apply the provisions of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs 
the provision requires that items such as idle facility expense  double freight and re handling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of abnormal as provided in the guidance 
in addition  the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
in early november  hurricane sandy hit the northeastern coast of the united states 
as a result of the extensive flooding that it caused  we expended additional costs for i temporary storage facilities  ii premiums for subhaulers as they were reassigned from other regions  and iii labor costs incurred for overtime  travel and lodging due to the reassignment of employees to the affected region 
these costs  which are characterized as abnormal under asc  inventory  were expensed as incurred and not included in inventory 
as of july   the incremental salvage vehicles received as a result of hurricane sandy have been sold 
derivatives and hedging we have entered into two interest rate swaps to eliminate interest rate risk on our variable rate term loan  and the swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges under asc  derivatives and hedging see note derivatives and hedging 
each quarter  we measure hedge effectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method and record in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness with the effective portion of the hedges change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income or loss 
capitalized software costs we capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage 
costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
total gross capitalized software as of july   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
accumulated amortization expense related to software for july   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments 
if billing disputes exceed expectations and or if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance  ie total write offs total accounts receivable write off percentage 
we note that a one percentage point deviation in the write off percentage would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of million 
valuation of goodwill we evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our operating segments annually or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  thereby requiring impairment charges in the future 
income taxes and deferred tax assets we account for income tax exposures as required under asc  income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us  canada  the us  brazil  germany and spain 
in arriving at a provision of income taxes  we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we then analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  such as various accruals  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income 
in the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from the deferred tax assets we carry on our consolidated balance sheet  we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
as of july   we have million of valuation allowance arising from both of our us and foreign operations 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 
historically  our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate 
nonetheless  our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors  including i the geographical allocation of our future earnings  ii the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  iii the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles  iv the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and v the outcome of the income tax examinations 
as a result  we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision 
based on our results for the twelve months ended july   a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of million 
we apply the provision of asc  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position  could require the use of cash 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service and us states 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
long lived asset valuation  including intangible assets we evaluate long lived assets  including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future  we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method 
compensation cost related to stock based payment transactions are recognized based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
determining the fair value of options using the black scholes merton option pricing model  or other currently accepted option valuation models  requires highly subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise  which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions  we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense  which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
retained insurance liabilities we are partially self insured for certain losses related to medical  general liability  workers compensation and auto liability 
our insurance policies are subject to a  deductible per claim  with the exception of our medical policy which is  per claim 
in addition  each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss which limits our ultimate exposure 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
the primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue 
our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation  differ from our estimates  our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows could be impacted 
the process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions  each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances 
the total amount reserved for all policies is million as of july  if the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by we estimate that our medical expense would change by million and our medical accrual would change by million 
if our total payroll changed by we estimate that our workers compensation expense would change by less than million and our accrual for workers compensation expenses would change by less than million 
a change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by less than million 
segment reporting our north american and uk regions are considered two separate operating segments  which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics 
recently issued accounting standards for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposures to financial market risk are interest rate risk  foreign currency risk and translation risk 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest income risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while secondarily maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective in the current uncertain global financial markets  as of july   all of our total cash and cash equivalents were held in bank deposits and money market funds 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash and cash equivalents are variable  a change in interest rates earned on our investment portfolio would impact interest income along with cash flows  but would not materially impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments 
as of july   we held no direct investments in auction rate securities  collateralized debt obligations  structured investment vehicles or mortgaged backed securities 
based on the average cash balance held during the twelve months ended july   a change in our interest yield would not materially affect our operating results 
interest expense risk our total borrowings under the credit facility were million as of july  amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest  subject to certain restrictions  at a fluctuating rate based on i the eurocurrency rate  ii the federal funds rate or iii the prime rate as described in the credit facility 
a default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility  at a rate per annum equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
based on the average credit facility balance held during the year ended july   a change in our interest rate would not materially affect our operating results 
we have entered into two interest rate swaps to exchange our variable interest rate payments commitment for fixed interest rate payments on the term loan balance to mitigate the interest expense risk 
foreign currency and translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate the results of operations of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries 
international net revenues result from transactions by our canadian  uk  uk  brazilian  spain and german operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur a majority of their expenses in the local currency  the canadian dollar  the british pound  the uae dirham  the brazilian real and the euro 
our international operations are subject to risks associated with foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  british pound  us dirham  brazilian real or euro in which our revenues and profits are denominated would result in a decrease increase to revenue of million for the twelve months ended july  fluctuations in foreign currencies create volatility in our reported consolidated financial position because we are required to remeasure substantially all assets and liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries at the current exchange rate at the close of the accounting period 
at july   the cumulative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated financial position was a net translation loss of million 
this loss is recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
a strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  british pound  us dirham  brazilian real or euro will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position 
we do not hedge our exposure to translation risks arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
