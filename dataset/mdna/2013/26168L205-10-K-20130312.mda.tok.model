item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we describe in detail the increase in our sales and profits during net sales for reached a record million  a percent increase over net sales of million in  as both of the company s segments achieved greater net sales growth than the industries they serve 
net sales of the company s rv segment increased percent  compared to a percent increase in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs 
approximately percent of the company s rv segment net sales are components to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs 
the rv segment represented percent of consolidated net sales in net sales of the company s mh segment increased percent  compared to a percent increase in industry wide production of manufactured homes 
the mh segment represented percent of consolidated net sales in the company s net sales growth exceeded industry wide wholesale shipments of rvs and manufactured homes during primarily as a result of acquisitions  market share gains and the introduction of new products 
in addition  the company achieved increased sales of components to adjacent industries  such as buses  modular housing  mobile office units  truck caps  and trailers used to haul boats  livestock  equipment and other cargo 
for  the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  an increase of percent from net income of million or per diluted share for net income in was impacted by lower operating efficiencies resulting from training in excess of  new employees  overtime  outsourcing and other costs required to meet the greater than expected million sales increase in in addition  the company incurred facility consolidation and realignment costs in order to meet the rising demand for its products 
further  the company continued to incur costs related to its investments in aluminum extrusion  awnings  and the aftermarket  and also incurred costs related to process changes and lean manufacturing initiatives 
over the latter half of  the company developed and implemented action plans to increase capacity and improve efficiencies 
in certain product lines  the company has begun to realize the benefits of these initiatives 
however  the full impact of these plans will take time to realize 
the company expects production efficiencies to further improve in  in particular the second half of on december   the company paid a special cash dividend of per share  an aggregate of million  to holders of record of its common stock on december  at december   the company had million in cash  no debt  and substantial available borrowing capacity

during and  the company added the capability to extrude aluminum at its new aluminum extrusion plant 
the extruded aluminum components produced are used in a variety of the company s products  and the lighter weight and durability of aluminum is expected to be attractive to manufacturers of rvs and motorhomes 
in  the company used in excess of million pounds of extruded aluminum 
further  the company markets extruded aluminum parts to manufacturers in other industries 
in late  the company launched a newly developed line of rv awnings 
the awnings are available in both manual and electric versions 
the market potential for the awning product line is in excess of million for manufacturers of rvs and an estimated million for aftermarket sales 
the raw materials  components  and manufacturing processes used to manufacture awnings are very similar to those the company uses in its other product lines 
the extruded aluminum components used in the awnings are produced in the company s new aluminum extrusion operation 
the company markets the awnings directly to rv manufacturers  as well as through aftermarket distributors 
the company rv segment products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of rvs such as thor industries symbol tho  forest river a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway  symbol brka and other oems  and  to a lesser extent  to distributors of aftermarket products 
the company rv segment operations compete on the basis of customer service  product quality and innovation  price and reliability

the company s share of the market for its products in adjacent industries cannot be readily determined  however  rv segment net sales to adjacent industries increased from million in to million in the company s share of the aftermarket for rv parts is not significant 
the company has made investments to increase its share of both adjacent industries and the aftermarket  and is committed to continue these expansion efforts 
detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the rv segment is included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
mh segment through its wholly owned subsidiaries  the company manufactures and markets a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes and to a lesser extent  modular housing and mobile office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens steel chassis thermoformed bath and kitchen products steel chassis parts steel and fiberglass entry doors axles aluminum and vinyl patio doors the company also supplies windows  doors  and thermoformed bath products as replacement parts to the manufactured housing aftermarket  and to adjacent industries 
in  the mh segment represented percent of the company consolidated net sales  and percent of consolidated segment operating profit 
certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both types of homes 
as a result  the company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed 
raw materials used by the company mh segment  consisting primarily of steel coil  sheet and i beam  extruded aluminum and vinyl  glass  and abs resin  are available from a number of sources  both domestic and foreign 
operations of the company mh segment consist primarily of fabricating  welding  thermoforming  painting and assembling components into finished products

the company s share of the market for its products in adjacent industries cannot be readily determined  however  mh segment net sales to adjacent industries increased from million in to million in the company s share of the aftermarket for manufactured housing parts is not significant 
the company has made investments to increase its share of both adjacent industries and the aftermarket  and is committed to continue these expansion efforts 
detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the mh segment is included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing other than the activities of its sales personnel and maintenance of customer relationships through quality of its products  innovation  service  price and customer satisfaction  the company does not engage in significant marketing efforts  and does not incur significant marketing or advertising expenditures 
the company has several supply agreements or other arrangements with certain of its customers that provide for prices of various products to be fixed for periods generally not in excess of eighteen months  however  in certain cases the company has the right to renegotiate the prices on sixty days notice 
both the rv segment and the mh segment typically ship products on average within one to two weeks of receipt of orders from their customers and  as a result  neither segment has any significant backlog 
because of fluctuations in dealer inventories  and volatile economic conditions  current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years 
capacity in  the company s facilities operated at an average of approximately percent of their practical capacity  and typically ran one shift of production per day 
capacity varies significantly based on seasonal demand  as well as by production facility  product line and geographic region  with certain facilities at times operating below percent utilization  while other facilities at times operating above percent utilization 
at december   the company operated facilities  and for most products has the ability to fill demand in excess of capacity at individual facilities by shifting production to other facilities  but the company would incur additional freight costs 
capital expenditures for were million 
the ability to expand capacity in certain product areas  if necessary  as well as the potential to reallocate existing resources  is monitored regularly by management to help ensure that the company can maintain a high level of production efficiencies throughout its operations

item a 
risk factors 
industry risk factors economic and business conditions beyond our control  including cyclicality and seasonality  have in the past had a significant adverse impact on our earnings  and could negatively impact our future results 
in  a combination of factors  including the weak economy and resulting recession  tight credit  reduced availability of home equity credit lines  high unemployment  low consumer confidence  and the deterioration in the real estate and mortgage markets adversely impacted our operating results 
as a result of these conditions  dealers reduced inventories and consumers were cautious about making purchases of discretionary big ticket items such as rvs and manufactured homes 
these conditions abated during and continued to improve during our net sales in increased percent compared to  and in increased percent compared to however  if the severity of these conditions resumes in the future  our earnings could be significantly impacted 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the rv and manufactured housing markets have been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand 
companies in these industries are subject to volatility in sales and operating results due to external factors such as economic and demographic changes 
consequently  the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period 
in addition  the long term decline in the retail demand and wholesale production of manufactured homes has reduced the demand for our manufactured housing products 
although industry wide wholesale production of manufactured homes improved modestly in  our annual results of operations could decline if manufactured housing industry conditions worsen 
reductions in the availability of wholesale financing limits the inventories carried by retail dealers of rvs and manufactured homes  which would cause reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes by our customers  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
retail dealers of rvs and manufactured homes generally finance their purchases of inventory with financing known as floor plan financing provided by lending institutions 
reduction in the availability of floor plan financing has in the past caused  and would cause  many dealers to reduce inventories of rvs and manufactured homes  which would result in reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
moreover  dealers which are unable to obtain adequate financing could cease operations 
their remaining inventories would likely be sold at deep discounts 
such sales would cause a decline in orders for new inventory  which would reduce demand for our products 
conditions in the credit market could limit the ability of consumers to obtain retail financing for rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
as a result of the recession and the factors leading to it  significant changes were implemented in the lending practices of financial institutions  and many lenders restricted loan availability 
restrictions on the availability of financing for rvs and manufactured homes limited the ability of consumers to purchase rvs and manufactured homes 
although these conditions have improved  a return to these conditions would again limit the ability of consumers to purchase rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes by our customers  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
limited availability of retail financing for manufactured homes  and higher costs of financing  limits the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  which would result in reduced demand for our products 
loans used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes usually have shorter terms and higher interest rates  and are more difficult to obtain  than mortgages for site built homes 
historically  lenders required higher down payment  higher credit scores and other criteria for these loans 
current lending criteria are higher than historical criteria  and many potential buyers of manufactured homes may not qualify 
the availability  cost  and terms of these loans are also dependent on economic conditions  lending practices of financial institutions  government policies  and other factors  all of which are beyond our control 
reductions in the availability of financing for manufactured homes and increases in the costs of this financing have limited  and could continue to limit  the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  resulting in reduced production of manufactured homes by our customers  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
excess inventories at dealers and manufacturers can cause a decline in the demand for our products 
dealers and manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes could accumulate excess unsold inventory 
existence of excess inventory has in the past caused  and would cause  a reduction in orders for new rvs and manufactured homes  which would cause a decline in demand for our products 
high levels of repossessions of manufactured homes and rvs could cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes and rvs  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
repossessed manufactured homes and rvs are resold by lenders  often at substantially reduced prices  which reduces the demand for new manufactured homes and rvs 
economic conditions have resulted  and could continue to result  in loan defaults and cause high levels of repossessions  which would cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes and rvs  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
gasoline shortages  or high prices for gasoline  could lead to reduced demand for our products 
travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  components for which represent approximately percent of our rv segment net sales  are usually towed by light trucks or suvs 
generally  these vehicles use more fuel than automobiles  particularly while towing rvs 
high prices for gasoline  or anticipation of potential fuel shortages  can affect consumer use and purchase of light trucks and suvs  which would result in reduced demand for travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
the manufactured housing industry has experienced a significant long term decline in shipments  which may continue 
our mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  operates in an industry which has experienced a decline in production of new homes compared to the peak of production in the downturn was caused  in part  by limited availability and high cost of financing for manufactured homes  and has been exacerbated by economic conditions 
moreover  because of the weak market for conventional housing  retirees may not be able to sell their primary residence  or may be unwilling to sell at currently depressed prices  and purchase less expensive manufactured homes 
in addition  the availability of foreclosed site built homes at reduced prices has impacted  and could continue to impact  the demand for manufactured homes 
if these conditions persist  the manufactured housing industry may not improve significantly 
certain of our manufactured housing customers have experienced financial difficulties and more of our manufactured housing customers may be similarly affected 
these factors could result in reduced demand for products from our mh segment  as well as difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
changes in zoning regulations for manufactured homes could lead to reduced demand for our products 
manufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning regulations 
there has been resistance by local property owners and zoning officials to zoning ordinances allowing the location of manufactured homes in certain areas comprised of conventional residences 
continued resistance to these zoning ordinances could have an adverse impact on sales and production of manufactured homes  which would reduce demand for our products 
company specific risk factors volatile raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
the prices we pay for steel  which represents approximately percent of our raw material costs  and other key raw materials  have been volatile 
because competition and business conditions may limit the amount or timing of increases in raw material costs that can be passed through to our customers in the form of sales price increases  future increases in raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
conversely  as raw material costs decline  we may not be able to maintain selling prices consistent with higher cost raw materials in our inventory  which could adversely affect our operating results 
inadequate supply of raw materials used to make our products could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
if raw materials or components that are used in manufacturing our products  particularly those which we import  become unavailable  or if the supply of these raw materials and components is interrupted  our manufacturing operations could be adversely affected 
the company currently imports approximately percent of its raw materials and components 
the loss of any customer accounting for more than percent of our consolidated net sales  and the consolidation of customers in our industries  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
one customer of the rv segment accounted for percent  and another customer of both the rv segment and the mh segment accounted for percent  of our consolidated net sales in the loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
the concentration of sales of our products to fewer customers as a result of consolidation of manufacturers in the industries we serve could impact our sales prices  which would adversely impact our operating results 
changes in consumer preferences relating to our products could cause reduced sales 
changes in consumer preferences  or our inability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences  for rvs or manufactured homes  or for the products we make for rvs and manufactured homes  could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our operating results 
competitive pressures could reduce demand for our products or impact our sales prices 
domestic and foreign competitors may lower prices on products which currently compete with our products  or develop product improvements  which could reduce demand for our products or cause us to reduce prices for our products 
in addition  the manufacture by our customers themselves of products supplied by us could reduce demand for our products 
increases in demand could result in difficulty obtaining additional skilled labor  and available capacity may initially not be utilized efficiently 
during and  the company experienced higher than usual production costs largely related to increased demand for certain of our products 
further  in certain geographic regions in which we have manufacturing facilities we have experienced shortages of qualified employees 
if demand continues to increase  the company may not be able to increase production to timely satisfy demand  and may initially incur higher labor and production costs  which could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
we may incur unexpected expenses  or face unanticipated delays  in connection with investments we make in our business  which could adversely impact our results 
it may take longer than initially anticipated for us to realize expected results from investments we have made in acquisitions  as well as initiatives we have implemented to improve production efficiencies and other aspects of our business  or we may incur unexpected expense in connection with these matters 
these results would have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 
we have recently entered new markets in order to enhance our growth potential 
uncertainties with respect to these new markets could impact our operating results 
the company is a leading supplier of components for rvs and manufactured housing  and currently has a significant share of the market for certain of its products  which would limit our ability to expand our market share for those products 
we have made investments in order to expand the sale of our products in the rv and manufactured housing aftermarket  and in adjacent industries beyond rvs and manufactured housing 
lack of demand for our products in these markets or competitive pressures requiring us to lower prices for our products would adversely impact our business in these markets and our results of operations 
the loss of any of our key operating management could reduce our ability to execute our business strategy and could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our key operating management 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key operating management could impair our ability to execute our business strategy  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in executive management have been implemented which could affect our operating results

lippert was appointed chief executive officer of the company to replace fredric m 
zinn  president and chief executive officer of the company

in addition  the company manufactures components for truck caps  buses  and trailers used to haul boats  livestock  equipment and other cargo adjacent industries 
approximately percent of the company s rv segment net sales are components to manufacturers of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs 
travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs accounted for percent of all rvs shipped by the industry in the company s mh segment manufactures a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes and to a lesser extent  modular housing and mobile office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens steel chassis thermoformed bath and kitchen products steel chassis parts steel and fiberglass entry doors axles aluminum and vinyl patio doors the company also supplies windows  doors and thermoformed bath products as replacement parts to the manufactured housing aftermarket 
certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both types of homes 
as a result  the company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed 
because of fluctuations in dealer inventories  and volatile economic conditions  current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years 
industry background recreational vehicle industry an rv is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational  camping  travel or seasonal use 
rvs may be motorized motorhomes or towable travel trailers  fifth wheel travel trailers  folding camping trailers and truck campers 
according to the recreation vehicle industry association rvia  industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs in  the company s primary rv markets  increased percent to  units compared to  as a result of a  unit increase in retail demand in  or percent  as compared to in addition  retail demand is typically revised upward in subsequent months 
rv dealers increasing inventory levels by  units in  or  more units than in the increase occurred largely in the fourth quarter of most industry analysts report that dealer inventories of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs are in line with anticipated retail demand in the upcoming spring selling season 
while the company measures its rv sales against industry wide wholesale shipment statistics  the underlying health of the rv industry is determined by retail demand 
a comparison of the number of units and the year over year percentage change in industry wide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  as reported by statistical surveys  inc  as well as the resulting change in dealer inventories  for both the united states and canada  is as follows wholesale retail unit impact on units change units change dealer inventories year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  rv dealers are expected to adjust the pace of their future orders for additional units based on retail demand  and the original equipment manufacturers oems  to which we sell our products  would need to adjust their production levels 
retail sales in the traditionally strong spring selling season will be a key indicator of consumer demand for rvs in the rvia has projected an percent increase in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs for  to  units 
retail sales of rvs have historically been closely tied to general economic conditions  as well as consumer confidence which  as reported by the conference board  was close to a five year high in february the company is encouraged that several key customers have expressed their long term optimism by expanding production capacity in  as well as by favorable reports from retail rv trade shows over the first couple months of the company also remains confident in its ability to exceed industry growth rates through new products  market share gains  acquisitions and ongoing investments in quality and in customer service 
in the long term  the company expects rv industry sales to be aided by positive demographics  and the continued popularity of the rv lifestyle 
further  the number of consumers between the ages of and will total million by  percent higher than in  according to us census figures  and one in ten vehicle owning households between and own at least one rv 
further  the rvia has a generic advertising campaign promoting the rv lifestyle 
the current campaign is targeted at both parents aged with children at home  as well as couples aged with no children at home 
the popularity of traveling in rvs to nascar and other sporting events  more family oriented domestic vacations  and using rvs as second homes  also appear to motivate consumer demand for rvs 
rvia studies indicate that rv vacations cost significantly less than other forms of vacation 
manufactured housing industry manufactured homes are built entirely in a factory on permanent steel undercarriages or chassis to which axles and wheels are attached 
the homes are then transported to a manufactured housing dealer which sells and transports the home to the buyer s home site 
the manufactured home is installed pursuant to a federal building code administered by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
the federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and construction  methods to site and secure the home at a home site  strength and durability  transportability  fire resistance  energy efficiency and quality 
the hud code also sets performance standards for the heating  plumbing  air conditioning  thermal and electrical systems 
it is the only federally regulated national building code 
on site additions  such as garages  decks and porches  often add to the attractiveness of manufactured homes and must be built to local  state or regional building codes 
a manufactured home may be sited on owned or leased land 
manufactured homes contain one or more floors or sections which can be joined to make larger homes 
a typical section may range in size from to  square feet 
during  multi section homes were percent of the total manufactured homes produced  compared to percent and percent in and  respectively 
multi section manufactured homes contain more of the company s products than single section manufactured homes 
the institute for building technology and safety ibts reported that industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes were  units in the first months of  an increase of percent from the comparable period of in the last four months of  there were  industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes  a decline of percent compared to the same period of this comparative decline resulted primarily from an increase in production in the last four months of in response to orders by the federal emergency management agency fema  of approximately  units  which did not recur in for the full year  there were  industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes  an increase of percent compared to industry wide wholesale shipments by the manufactured housing industry declined during the period from to for a variety of reasons 
because of the current real estate  credit and economic environment  including the availability of foreclosed site built homes at abnormally low prices and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site built homes and loans for manufactured homes  industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes may remain low until these conditions improve 
in addition  certain provisions of the recently enacted dodd frank act which regulate financial transactions could make certain types of mortgages historically used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes more difficult to obtain 
although it has been reported that new legislation will be introduced to address this matter  there can be no assurance of the outcome of this legislation 
the company believes that long term growth prospects for manufactured housing may be positive because of i the quality and affordability of the home  ii favorable demographic trends  including the increasing number of retirees who  in the past  had represented a significant market for manufactured homes  and iii pent up demand by retirees who have been unable or unwilling to sell their primary residence and purchase a manufactured home 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights net sales for reached a record million  a percent increase over net sales of million in  as both of the company s segments achieved greater net sales growth than the industries they serve 
this sales growth was primarily the result of a percent sales increase by drew s rv segment  which accounted for percent of drew s consolidated net sales in rv segment sales growth was primarily due to a percent increase in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  drew s primary rv market  as well as acquisitions  new product introductions  market share gains  and increased sales to adjacent industries  such as buses  truck caps  and trailers used to haul boats  livestock  equipment and other cargo 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  consolidated net sales increased percent 
in  the company continued to grow outside its core rv and manufactured housing markets  with aggregate net sales of components for adjacent industries increasing percent  to million  and aftermarket sales increasing percent to million in together  these markets now account for nearly percent of consolidated net sales  as compared to percent of consolidated net sales in as the company gains market share in the aftermarket and adjacent industries  it expects its incremental margin in these markets to initially be lower than the percent target incremental margin for established products  due to fixed costs  start up costs and competition 
however  over the long term the company expects margins in adjacent industries and the aftermarket to be similar to historical margins 
the company s net sales for the first two months of reached approximately million  percent higher than the comparable period of there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
for  the company s net income increased to million  or per diluted share 
excluding charges related to executive succession  net income would have been million in  or per diluted share  up from net income of million  or per diluted share in net income in was impacted by lower operating efficiencies resulting from training in excess of  new employees  overtime  outsourcing and other costs required to meet the greater than expected million sales increase in in addition  the company incurred facility consolidation and realignment costs in order to meet the rising demand for its products 
further  the company continued to incur costs related to its investments in aluminum extrusion  awnings  and the aftermarket  and also incurred costs related to process changes and lean manufacturing initiatives 
over the latter half of  the company developed and implemented action plans to increase capacity and improve efficiencies 
in certain product lines  the company has begun to realize the benefits of these initiatives 
however  the full impact of these plans will take time to realize

critical accounting policies the company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that reduces accounts receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in assessing the collectability of its accounts receivable  the company considers such factors as the current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be required 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
to the extent that actual demand or market conditions in the future differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded inventory reserves may be required 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by third party claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be required 
warranty the company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold 
the company estimates the warranty accrual based upon various factors  including i historical warranty costs  ii current trends  iii product mix  and iv sales 
the accounting for warranty accruals requires the company to make assumptions and judgments  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be required 
income taxes the company tax provision is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  federal and state tax credits  and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision and in evaluating the company tax position 
the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that the tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain tax positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
the company adjusts these tax accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the expected outcome of tax audits 
the company accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management estimate of realizability  which is reassessed each quarter based upon the company forecast of future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets  and may result in the recognition of a valuation reserve 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets  including other intangible assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset carrying value over its fair value would be recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test as of november th each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates pending proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel 
these contingencies require management s judgment in assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
contingent consideration payments in connection with several acquisitions completed in the past few years  in addition to the cash paid at closing  additional payments could be required depending upon the level of sales generated from certain of the acquired products 
the fair value of the aggregate estimated contingent consideration payments has been recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
each quarter  the company is required to re evaluate the fair value of the liability for the estimated contingent consideration payments for such acquisitions 
the fair value of the contingent consideration payments is estimated using a discounted cash flow model 
this model involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including sales of certain products  future business plans  economic projections  weighted average cost of capital  and market data 
actual results may differ from forecasted results 
other estimates the company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business including  but not limited to  those related to product returns  sales rebates  accounts receivable  lease terminations  asset retirement obligations  executive succession  post retirement benefits  stock based compensation  segment allocations  environmental liabilities  and contingencies 
establishing reserves for these matters requires management estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are based on management current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors  as appropriate 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
inflation the prices of key raw materials  consisting primarily of steel and aluminum  and components used by the company which are made from these raw materials  are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities  rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of these commodities have historically been volatile  and over the past few months prices have continued to fluctuate 
the company experienced increases in its labor costs in which may be partially related to inflation 
during mid  the company had difficulties finding qualified production employees for certain facilities and incurred higher than normal labor costs as a result 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has historically been exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing activities 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings 
the company is also exposed to changes in the prices of raw materials  specifically steel and aluminum 
the company has entered into derivative instruments for the purpose of managing a portion of the exposures associated with fluctuations in aluminum costs 
while these derivative instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  these fluctuations are generally offset by the changes in fair value of the underlying exposures 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of derivative instruments 
the company has historically been able to obtain sales price increases to offset the majority of raw material cost increases 
however  there can be no assurance that future cost increases  if any  can be partially or fully passed on to customers  or that the timing of such increases will match raw material cost increases 
additional information required by this item is included under the caption inflation in item of this report
