item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements  related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview synta pharmaceuticals corp 
is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  and commercializing small molecule drugs to extend and enhance the lives of patients with severe medical conditions  including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases 
we have two drug candidates in clinical trials for treating multiple types of cancer and several drug candidates in the preclinical stage of development 
all of our drug candidates have been discovered and developed internally using our proprietary  unique chemical compound library and integrated discovery engine 
we retain full ownership of all of our drug candidates 
we were incorporated in march and commenced operations in july since that time  we have been principally engaged in the discovery and development of novel drug candidates 
as of december   we have funded our operations principally with million in net proceeds from private and public offerings of our equity  as well as million in gross proceeds from two term loans  including million from a term loan that was executed in september with general electric capital corporation  or gecc  and one other lender  and million from a term loan that was executed in march with oxford finance corporation  or oxford 
in january and february  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of per share  including  shares in the initial closing in january and  shares in a second closing in february following the full exercise of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters 
in july  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share to certain directors  including our largest stockholder 
in december  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share to investors and certain directors  including our largest stockholder 
on may   as amended  we entered into an at the market issuance sales agreement  or sales agreement  with mlv co 
llc  or mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time  at our option  through mlv as our sales agent  subject to certain terms and conditions 
to date  no shares have been sold under the sales agreement 
in addition to raising capital from financing activities  we have also received substantial capital from partnering activities 
in october  we entered into a global collaborative development  commercialization and license agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  for the joint development and commercialization of elesclomol 
this collaboration was terminated in september in december  we entered into a collaborative license agreement with hoffman la roche  or roche  for our cracm inhibitor program 
this collaboration was terminated effective on february  as of december   we have received million in nonrefundable partnership payments under these agreements with gsk and with roche  including million in upfront payments  million in operational milestones and million in research and development funding 
as of december   these nonrefundable partnership payments together with the cash proceeds from equity financings  the term loans from gecc and oxford  and the exercise of common stock warrants and options  provided aggregate cash proceeds of approximately million 
we have also generated funds from government grants  equipment lease financings and investment income 
we are engaged in preliminary partnership discussions for a number of our programs  which may provide us with additional financial resources if consummated 
we have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the research and development of our drug candidates 
since our inception  we have had no revenues from product sales 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials  and seek regulatory approval and eventual commercialization 
we will need to generate significant revenues from product sales to achieve future profitability and may never do so 
oncology programs we have two clinical stage programs and one preclinical stage program in oncology ganetespib hsp inhibitor ganetespib is a potent  synthetic  small molecule inhibitor of hsp  a chaperone protein that is essential to the function of certain other proteins  such as tyrosine kinases and transcription factors that drive the growth  proliferation  and survival of many different types of cancer 
ganetespib is currently being evaluated in a broad range of clinical trials both in combination with other therapies and as a single agent 
in clinical trials to date  ganetespib has shown encouraging evidence of clinical activity  including  when used as monotherapy  prolonged tumor shrinkage in patients who have progressed after  or failed to respond to  treatment with commonly used drugs for these tumors  and in combination with chemotherapy where improvements in overall survival have been seen in a randomized study 
ganetespib is currently being evaluated in a broad range of cancer clinical trials including our patient galaxy nsclc program in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy  and as monotherapy in certain genetically defined targeted patient populations 
a favorable safety profile has been consistently observed across clinical trials  involving over patients treated with ganetespib to date 
ganetespib has shown no evidence of the serious liver or common ocular toxicities reported with other hsp inhibitors  or the neurotoxicity  bone marrow toxicities  and alopecia characteristic of many chemotherapies 
the most common adverse event reported with ganetespib has been transient  mild or moderate diarrhea  which can be prevented or effectively managed with standard supportive care 
ganetespib mechanism of action ganetespib potently inhibits hsp  a chaperone protein required for the proper folding and activation of numerous client proteins  particularly kinases  that play critical roles in tumor cell growth  differentiation and survival 
a number of sensitive hsp client proteins  such as alk  her  ar  mutant braf and egfr  have been implicated as oncogenic drivers in a variety of human tumors  including lung  breast  prostate and melanoma 
moreover  many client proteins are the targets of marketed cancer drugs such as avastin  erbitux  gleevec  herceptin  nexavar  sutent  tarceva  votrient  xalkori  and zelboraf 
ganetespib is a novel small molecule that is structurally unrelated to first generation  ansamycin family compounds  such as aag or dmag 
in preclinical studies  ganetespib has shown times greater potency than aag across a broad range of cancer cell types as well as activity in animal models that are resistant to treatment with aag 
results published in molecular cancer therapeutics in december highlighted certain physicochemical properties of ganetespib we believe contribute to its improved safety and activity relative to other hsp inhibitors 
these properties include smaller size  greater potency in inhibiting hsp  improved ability to passively enter cells  absence of a molecular component believed to cause liver toxicity  and the ability to penetrate deep into tumor tissue 
because of the broad spectrum of biological activity conferred by ganetespib treatment  an additional approach has been to combine this agent with standard of care chemotherapeutics or other molecularly targeted agents 
in this regard  we have demonstrated a clear capacity of ganetespib to augment the cytotoxic activity of dna damaging chemotherapeutics in multiple models 
in addition  our data suggest that many relevant client proteins affected by ganetespib within this context are implicated in other critical tumorigenic processes  such as metastasis and angiogenesis 
prior work has established that regulators of tumor metastasis  such as the transcription factor hif alpha  and regulators of angiogenesis  including vegf and related receptors  are all down regulated by ganetespib 
ganetespib clinical trials we are sponsoring four principal ongoing trials evaluating ganetespib activity galaxy a patient global  randomized phase b trial designed to evaluate ganetespib in combination with docetaxel versus docetaxel alone as second line therapy in advanced nsclc patients with adenocarcinoma histology  galaxy a patient  global  randomized  confirmatory phase clinical trial evaluating ganetepsib plus docetaxel vs 
docetaxel alone for the treatment of second line advanced adenocarcinoma nsclc  as with galaxy results from an interim analysis of the galaxy trial conducted in september were used to inform the design of galaxy  enriching for those patients who showed enhanced clinical benefit from treatment with ganetespib in galaxy  chiara a phase trial evaluating ganetespib monotherapy in nsclc patients whose tumors have a genetic profile characterized by rearrangement of the alk gene alk  and enchant a phase trial evaluating ganetespib monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed her and triple negative metastatic breast cancer 
nsclc in a june we reported top line results from a planned interim analysis of galaxy the analysis was planned for when approximately of patients had been enrolled 
at the time of this analysis  a total of adenocarcinoma and non adenocarcinoma patients had been enrolled 
on september   we reported results from the second interim efficacy analysis at the european society for medical oncology esmo congress 
overall survival results are described in the table below 
median survival for the docetaxel control arm in both the intent to treat itt and the month follow up groups was consistent with comparable historical results 
median survival had not yet been reached for the combination arm 
overall survival  all adenocarcinoma patients all patients in database n all patients enrolled more than months prior to data cutoff n hr ci p value median d vs g d mo vs 
nr mo vs nr hr hazard ratio  ci confidence interval  nr not reached progression free survival was months vs 
months p and overall response rate was vs 
p for docetaxel vs 
ganetespib plus docetaxel  respectively 
all p values are calculated using the sided stratified log rank test for survival endpoints and using fisher exact test for response rate 
in november  we participated in an end of phase eop meeting with the u 
s 
food and drug administration fda to review plans for the patient  global  randomized phase galaxy clinical trial 
we have incorporated comments from this meeting into the protocol  and expect enrollment to begin in the first quarter of the galaxy trial will enroll adenocarcinoma patients with advanced nsclc who have received one prior treatment for metastatic disease  and will randomize those patients to treatment with docetaxel plus ganetespib  or docetaxel alone  as with galaxy the same dose and schedule used in galaxy will be used in the phase galaxy trial 
patients on both arms will receive docetaxel generally for four to six day cycles  as per standard practice at their treatment center 
after completion of docetaxel treatment  patients on the ganetespib arm are eligible to continue to receive ganetespib monotherapy as maintenance treatment 
the trial will be conducted in many of the centers across europe and north america that participated in the galaxy trial  together with approximately additional centers 
results from the interim analysis for galaxy were used to inform the eligibility criteria for the galaxy trial 
galaxy will enroll patients who have progressed following treatment with one prior platinum containing regimen of chemotherapy as first line therapy  and who were diagnosed with metastatic disease at least six months prior to study entry 
the primary endpoint of galaxy will be overall survival 
two event driven interim analyses of the overall survival primary endpoint of galaxy have been specified 
based on current projections and statistical assumptions  we expect these analyses  together with the final overall survival analysis  to occur in in  we presented results from a phase trial of ganetespib administered as a monotherapy in patients with advanced nsclc at the asco annual meeting and the international association for the study of lung cancer iaslc th world conference on lung cancer  respectively 
results presented at these meetings showed a connection between single agent ganetespib clinical activity and certain tumor genetic profiles 
four of eight patients who were alk  ie  for whom tumor genetic testing revealed rearrangements in the alk gene  experienced confirmed partial responses following treatment with ganetespib a objective response rate  using the standard definition of complete response plus partial response 
to further characterize ganetespib activity in the alk nsclc treatment setting  we initiated the chiara trial in to evaluate ganetespib monotherapy in alk nsclc patients who have not been previously treated with a direct alk inhibitor 
we expect to use results from an initial phase of enrollment  which was completed in the first quarter of  to inform our decision on whether to continue additional enrollment in this trial 
preclinical results from experiments conducted in our laboratories have demonstrated synergy between ganetespib and crizotinib or other alk inhibitors 
these data support our view of future combination approaches with ganetespib and alk inhibitors for treatment of alk nsclc 
a number of cancer centers and cooperative groups have approached us with proposals to support trials evaluating ganetespib in combination with other agents in alk disease 
an investigator sponsored phase trial evaluating ganetespib and crizotinib combinations in patients with alk nsclc that have not been previously treated with an alk inhibitor began enrolling patients at memorial sloan kettering cancer center mskcc in new york city in breast cancer in  we initiated the enchant trial designed to evaluate ganetespib monotherapy as first line treatment for both metastatic her breast cancer and tnbc 
patients in both cohorts will be assessed at baseline and at week   and with a combination of pet and ct scans 
the primary endpoint of this study is overall response rate at week up to patients will be enrolled in each of the her and tnbc cohorts 
we expect preliminary results from the enchant trial in the first half of in addition to evaluating monotherapy administration of ganetespib in breast cancer  we and our collaborators believe that combination therapy with ganetespib has promise 
mskcc has announced that it will initiate a phase trial evaluating ganetespib in combination with paclitaxel and herceptin in her breast cancer  and ganetespib in combination with paclitaxel in tnbc 
additional clinical trials in addition to the clinical trials we plan to initiate and continue in  a number of ganetespib trials sponsored by third parties  including cooperative groups  foundations  and individual investigators  have recently been initiated or are expected to initiate in these include the following the trials evaluating ganetespib in breast cancer and in alk lung cancer sponsored by mskcc described above  a randomized trial evaluating the combination of fulvestrant and ganetespib in patients with hormone receptor positive  metastatic breast cancer  being conducted at the dana farber cancer institute  which began enrolling patients in  a trial evaluating the combination of ganetespib with capecitabine and radiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer being conducted at emory university  which began enrolling patients in  a trial evaluating both ganetespib monotherapy and the combination of ganetespib and bortezomib in multiple myeloma  which began enrolling patients in and is supported by a grant of up to million by the multiple myeloma research foundation  a randomized trial evaluating the combination of ganetespib and low dose ara c chemotherapy in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia aml being conducted at cardiff university  which began enrolling patients in  and a trial evaluating ganetespib in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma  being sponsored by cancer research uk  which we expect to begin enrolling patients in the first half of in addition  a european cooperative group plans to initiate a randomized trial comparing paclitaxel with and without ganetespib in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in elesclomol mitochondria targeting agent elesclomol is a first in class  investigational drug candidate that triggers programmed cell death apoptosis  in cancer cells through a novel mechanism disrupting cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism 
in preclinical experiments  anti cancer activity of elesclomol has been shown to correlate with certain biomarkers  including lactate dehydrogenase ldh  which can distinguish between active mitochondria sufficient oxygen present and inactive mitochondria insufficient oxygen present 
consistent with these findings in three randomized clinical trials  ldh was an important predictor of elesclomol treatment outcome 
our current clinical program for elesclomol includes a clinical trial of elesclomol as a monotherapy in aml 
in december  we presented results at the american society for hematology ash meeting showing that elesclomol was highly active against aml cell lines and primary blast cells from aml patients 
in february  we announced that the first patient had been treated in a phase dose escalation study of elesclomol as a single agent in patients with aml 
this trial will enroll up to patients with relapsed or refractory aml and total baseline serum ldh level less than times uln 
patients will be treated with elesclomol sodium on a once weekly schedule at a starting dose of mg m  with dose escalation planned based on safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetic considerations 
the trial is being conducted at princess margaret hospital in toronto  canada and at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york 
we are also evaluating the use of elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel in ovarian cancer 
in march  the gynecological oncology group gog  initiated a phase clinical trial of elesclomol in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of persistent or recurrent ovarian  fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer for patients with total baseline serum ldh level less than times uln 
the gog is a non profit organization with the purpose of promoting excellence in the quality and integrity of clinical and basic scientific research in the field of gynecologic malignancies 
the national cancer institute is providing financial support of up to approximately  for the trial through its cancer therapy evaluation program 
the ovarian cancer trial has met the prespecified efficacy requirement to advance to stage and full enrollment of the phase study  indicating potential activity in this difficult to treat patient population with limited treatment options 
sta vascular disrupting agent sta is a novel  injectable  small molecule compound that appears to disrupt the blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and essential nutrients  and is in preclinical development 
in march  we received a million grant from the united states department of defense dod for the development of sta in advanced prostate cancer and initiated work on this study in the second quarter of we completed work covered by this grant in our inflammatory disease programs we have two preclinical stage programs focusing on treatments for inflammatory diseases 
both of our inflammatory disease programs focus on oral  disease modifying drug candidates that act through novel mechanisms and could potentially target multiple indications 
cracm ion channel inhibitors we have developed novel  small molecule inhibitors of cracm ion channels expressed on immune cells 
our cracm ion channel inhibitors have shown strong anti inflammatory activity in preclinical studies both in vitro and in vivo  inhibiting t cell and mast cell activity  including cytokine release  degranulation  and immune cell proliferation 
potential applications include a wide range of inflammatory diseases and disorders for which modulating t cell and mast cell function has been shown to be critical  including rheumatoid arthritis ra  asthma  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  allergy  transplant rejection  and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
we have several promising cracm inhibitors in preclinical development 
because there are a number of cracm ion channel targets on immune cells  we believe that cracm inhibitor compounds can be developed that target different diseases 
roche cracm inhibitor alliance in december  as amended in february  february and july  we formed a strategic alliance with roche to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels  which we refer to as the roche agreement 
the goal of this alliance was to develop a novel category of oral  disease modifying agents for the treatment of ra and other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions 
on november   we received notice from roche of its election to terminate the roche agreement  which termination became effective on february  roche termination of the agreement falls under the termination for convenience clause of the agreement 
as a result of termination of the roche agreement  the research  development and commercialization licenses granted to roche by us have terminated 
ownership of all rights to all licensed compounds as defined in the agreement including the scientific data relating to those compounds has reverted to us 
we have also received an exclusive license to use roche patent rights and know how to research  develop  manufacture  commercialize and import any collaboration compound  including the licensed compounds 
we are obligated to pay a low single digit royalty on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product as defined in the agreement basis upon commercialization of any licensed product 
il inhibitors the il cytokine is an important master switch that triggers the immune response of the t cell known as t helper type th 
t cells play a critical role in the coordination of the body immune response  and while th cells are normally involved in the body defense against intracellular attack by bacteria and other microorganisms  an overactive th response can lead to various autoimmune or inflammatory diseases including crohn disease  psoriasis  ra  multiple sclerosis  and common variable immunodeficiency 
the il cytokine is critical to the generation of a class of t cells known as th  which produce other pro inflammatory proteins such as il  which are critical in driving chronic inflammation 
we believe that the clinical trial results observed with anti il antibody therapies validate the inhibition of il activity as a promising approach for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
we have identified several small molecule il inhibitors that represent a promising opportunity to develop drug candidates that could be administered orally and potentially address a wide range of serious inflammatory diseases with high unmet medical needs financial operations overview revenue we have not yet generated any product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
our revenues to date have been generated primarily through our former collaboration agreements with gsk and roche 
the terms of these agreements included payment to us of upfront license fees  milestone payments  research and development cost sharing and royalties 
we will seek to generate revenue from product sales and from future collaborative or strategic relationships 
in the future  we expect any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received and expenses incurred under future collaborations or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our drug candidates  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
research and development research and development expense consists of costs incurred in connection with developing and advancing our drug discovery technology and identifying and developing our drug candidates 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
our research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research  preclinical and clinical activities  payments to third party contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  costs associated with drug formulation and supply of drugs for clinical trials  personnel related expenses  including salaries  stock based compensation  benefits and travel  and overhead expenses  including rent and maintenance of our facilities  and laboratory and other supplies 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing our drug candidates 
we believe that accurately projecting total program specific expenses through commercialization is not possible at this time 
the timing and amount of these expenses will depend upon the costs associated with potential future clinical trials of our drug candidates  and any expansion of our research and development organization  regulatory requirements  advancement of our preclinical programs and product manufacturing costs  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on the stage of development of our drug candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including with respect to the number of clinical sites included in the trial  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  and the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals 
in addition  we may obtain unexpected or unfavorable results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables in the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
in  we anticipate that the overall costs under our ganetespib program will increase as we further advance clinical development of ganetespib  including the galaxy  galaxy  enchant and chiara trials  and conduct non clinical supporting activities 
beyond our current lead drug candidates  we anticipate that we will select drug candidates and research projects for further development on an ongoing basis in response to their preclinical and clinical success  as well as commercial potential 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in executive  finance  business and commercial development  investor and medical community relations  human resources and administrative functions 
other costs include stock based compensation costs  directors and officers liability insurance premiums  legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  fees for general legal  accounting  public company requirements and compliance  and other professional services  as well as overhead related costs not otherwise included in research and development 
in  under our current operating plan  we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will remain at levels similar to general and administrative expenses may increase in if we significantly expand pre commercial development and medical community relations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we are required to make estimates and judgments with respect to research contract accruals  the recoverability of long lived assets  measurement of stock based compensation and the periods of performance under collaborative research and development agreements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  known trends and events  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
marketable securities marketable securities consist of investments in high grade corporate obligations  and government and government agency obligations that are classified as available for sale 
since these securities are available to fund current operations they are classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust the cost of available for sale debt securities for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
we include such amortization and accretion in interest and investment income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value  if any  that we judge to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are reported in interest and investment income 
to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists  we consider whether we intend to sell the debt security and  if we do not intend to sell the debt security  we consider available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before the recovery of our amortized cost basis 
during the years ended december   and  we determined that no securities were other than temporarily impaired 
marketable securities are stated at fair value  including accrued interest  with their unrealized gains and losses included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
the fair value of these securities is based on quoted prices and observable inputs on a recurring basis 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded no realized gains or losses on marketable securities 
revenue recognition collaboration and license agreements our principal source of revenue to date has been generated from former collaborative research and development agreements with roche and gsk  which included upfront license payments  development milestones  reimbursement of research and development costs  and potential profit sharing payments  commercialization and sales based milestones and royalties 
the application of accounting rules requires subjective analysis and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about whether deliverables within multiple element arrangements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual arrangement into separate units of accounting and to determine the fair value to be allocated to each unit of accounting 
for multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified after january   we follow the provisions of asu no 
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

this standard addresses the determination of the unit s of accounting for multiple element arrangements and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to each unit of accounting 
pursuant to this standard  each required deliverable is evaluated to determine if it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
for us this determination includes an assessment as to whether the deliverable has stand alone value to the customer separate from the undelivered elements 
the arrangement consideration is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
the estimated selling price of each deliverable is determined using the following hierarchy of values i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  ii third party evidence of selling price  and iii our best estimate of the selling price besp 
the besp reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by it on a stand alone basis 
we expect  in general  to use besp for allocating consideration to each deliverable in future collaboration agreements 
in general  the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is then recognized as the related goods or services are delivered limited to the consideration not contingent upon future deliverables 
effective january   we adopted asu no 
which codified a method of revenue recognition that has been common practice 
under this method  contingent consideration from research and development activities that is earned upon the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
at the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments  we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive 
this evaluation includes an assessment of whether a the consideration is commensurate with either the entity performance to achieve the milestone  or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity performance to achieve the milestone  b the consideration relates solely to past performance and c the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
we evaluate factors such as the scientific  clinical  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment 
from the effective date of the adoption of this standard  we did not achieve any developmental  commercial or sales based milestones pursuant to its research and collaboration agreement with roche 
upon the effectiveness of the termination of the collaboration agreement with roche on february   as more fully described in note  we have no ongoing research and collaboration agreements under which milestones may be achieved 
royalty revenues are based upon a percentage of net sales 
royalties from the sales of products will be recorded on the accrual basis when results are reliably measurable  collectibility is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
commercial and sales based milestones  which are based upon the achievement of certain agreed upon sales thresholds  will be recognized in the period in which the respective sales threshold is achieved and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accrued expenses and accrued contract research liabilities as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
given our current business  the primary area of uncertainty concerning accruals which could have a material effect on our business is with respect to service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical drug supplies and to contract research organizations in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in connection with all of the foregoing service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers  including contract research organizations  invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify some costs which have begun to be incurred  or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in a given period  our reported expenses for such period would be understated or overstated 
we currently reflect the over or under accrual of expenses directly in our operations in the period the amount was determined 
our arrangements with contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials often provide for payment prior to commencing the project or based upon predetermined milestones throughout the period during which services are expected to be performed 
we recognize expense relating to these arrangements based on the various services provided over the estimated time to completion 
the date on which services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often determined based on subjective judgments 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us based on the terms of the contract and our ongoing monitoring of service performance 
in the years ended december   and  respectively  we had arrangements with multiple contract research organizations whereby these organizations commit to performing services for us over multiple reporting periods 
we currently recognize and plan to continue to recognize the expenses associated with these arrangements based on our expectation of the timing of the performance of components under these arrangements by these organizations 
generally  these components consist of the costs of setting up the trial  monitoring the trial  closing the trial and preparing the resulting data 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are enrolled in the trial 
with respect to financial reporting periods presented in this annual report on form k  and based on our receipt of invoices from our third party providers  the timing of our actual costs incurred have not differed materially from our estimated timing of such costs 
in light of the foregoing  we do not believe our estimates of future expenses and our practice of making judgments concerning the accrual of expenses are reasonably likely to change in the future 
there were no changes in our estimates and accruals for contract service fees that had a material effect on our net income loss for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock options granted to employees  officers and directors 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as it is the most appropriate valuation method for our option grants 
the black scholes model requires inputs for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility and expected lives of the options 
expected volatility was principally based upon the weighted average historical volatility data of our common stock and the historical volatility data from several guideline public biotechnology companies similar in size and value to us that also have stock compensation plans with similar terms 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical data 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we have applied a forfeiture rate of to all options that vest upon completion of the first year of service following the date of grant 
the analysis is re evaluated at least annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
the expected lives for options granted represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we use the simplified method for determining the expected lives of options 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we amortize the fair value of each option over each option service period  which is generally the vesting period 
our net income loss included compensation costs in the amount of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangements for employee and non employee awards 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized stock based compensation expense was million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
consolidated results of operations years ended december   and revenue years ended december  comparison comparison dollars in millions collaboration revenue license and milestone revenue roche cost sharing reimbursements  net roche total collaboration revenue grant revenue total revenues roche overview 
in december  as amended in february  february and july  we entered into a collaborative license agreement with roche to discover  develop  and commercialize small molecule drugs targeting cracm channels and received a million nonrefundable upfront payment from roche in january reimbursements of research and development costs to us by roche were recorded as cost sharing revenue in the period in which the related research and development costs were incurred 
the initial two year research term concluded on december  on november   the company received written notice of roche election to terminate the roche agreement  which termination became effective on february  see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

liquidity funding requirements we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses and losses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we complete the ongoing clinical trials of ganetespib in solid tumors  including the galaxy  galaxy  enchant and chiara trials  and initiate additional clinical trials of ganetespib if supported by trial results  complete preclinical development of an additional hsp inhibitor and initiate clinical trials of this compound  if supported by the preclinical data  complete the ongoing clinical trials of elesclomol in aml and ovarian cancers  and initiate additional clinical trials of elesclomol  if supported by trial results  complete preclinical development of sta and initiate clinical trials  if supported by preclinical data  advance our cracm inhibitor into preclinical development and initiate clinical trials  if supported by preclinical data  discover  develop  and seek regulatory approval for backups of our current drug candidates and other new drug candidates  identify additional compounds or drug candidates and acquire rights from third parties to those compounds or drug candidates through licenses  acquisitions or other means  and commercialize any approved drug candidates 
our funding requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress and results of our ongoing clinical trials of ganetespib and elesclomol  and any additional clinical trials we may initiate in the future based on the results of these clinical trials  the results of our preclinical studies of any additional hsp inhibitors we may develop  our cracm inhibitor and sta  and our decision to initiate clinical trials  if supported by the preclinical and other test results  uncertainty associated with costs  timing  and outcome of regulatory review of our drug candidates  the scope  progress  results  and cost of preclinical development  clinical trials  and regulatory review of any new drug candidates we may discover or acquire  the costs of preparing  filing  and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing  and defending intellectual property related claims  our ability to establish additional strategic collaborations and licensing or other arrangements on terms favorable to us  the costs to satisfy our obligations under potential future collaborations  and the timing  receipt  and amount of sales or royalties  if any  from ganetespib  elesclomol  sta  our cracm inhibitors  our il inhibitors and our other potential products 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  an increase of million from million as of december  this increase principally reflects the million in net proceeds raised from the public and registered direct offerings of our common stock and exercises of common stock options in  offset by our cash used in operations as discussed under cash flows above 
we do not anticipate that we will generate product revenue in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we expect our continuing operations to use cash over the next several years and such cash use may increase significantly from year to year 
while we are engaged in multiple preliminary partnership discussions for each of our currently unpartnered programs  including ganetespib  elesclomol  sta  cracm  and our il inhibitors  which could result in one or more new partnership agreements that may include upfront payments and cost sharing provisions  there is no guarantee we will be successful in entering into any such partnership agreements on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that we will receive any other revenue through these partnership efforts in the future 
based on our current operating levels  we expect our cash resources will be sufficient to fund operations into the second quarter of this estimate assumes that the timing and nature of activities contemplated for will be conducted subject to the availability of sufficient financial resources 
we continue to evaluate additional potential sources of funding  including partnership agreements  cost or risk sharing arrangements  equity financings  use of our million at the market issuance sales agreement with mlv or other sources 
we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials and conduct additional preclinical and discovery activities 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our drug candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  collaboration agreements  debt financings or licensing arrangements 
however  additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or by selling convertible debt securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we raise funds through collaboration agreements or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
conversely  we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
we currently have an effective shelf registration statement on form s  under which we currently have up to million in securities available for issuance  including up to million in shares of common stock that we have reserved and that may be offered and sold under the at the market issuance sales agreement with mlv 
we plan to file a new shelf registration statement on form s in march to register up to million of our securities for future issuance 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
tax loss carryforwards for tax years through  we performed analyses to determine if there were changes in ownership  as defined by section of the internal revenue code that would limit our ability to utilize certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we determined that we experienced a change in ownership  as defined by section  in connection with the acquisition of principia associates  inc on september   but did not experience a change in ownership upon the effectiveness of our ipo or any other equity offerings to date 
as a result  the utilization of our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change is limited 
as of december  we have net operating loss carryforwards for us federal tax purposes of approximately million  after taking into consideration net operating losses expected to expire unused as a result of this limitation  and the remainder will expire in varying amounts through unless utilized 
in addition  as of december   we have state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire through unless utilized 
the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited as we experience future ownership changes as defined in section of the internal revenue code

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million consisting of cash deposited in a highly rated financial institution in the united states and in a short term us treasury money market fund  as well as high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we did not have material exposure to high risk investments such as mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities or other special investment vehicles within our money market fund investments 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources 
one possible source of funding is through further equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
