item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we operate in three primary business segments manufacturing  wheels  repair parts  and leasing services 
these three business segments are operationally integrated 
the manufacturing segment  operating from facilities in the united states  mexico and poland  produces double stack intermodal railcars  conventional railcars  tank cars  marine vessels and automotive railcar products 
the wheels  repair parts segment performs wheel and axle servicing  railcar repair  refurbishment and maintenance activities  as well as production and reconditioning of a variety of parts for the railroad industry in north america 
the leasing services segment owns approximately  railcars and provides management services for approximately  railcars for railroads  shippers  carriers  institutional investors and other leasing and transportation companies in north america 
we also produce rail castings through an unconsolidated joint venture 
management evaluates segment performance based on margin 
multi year supply agreements are a part of rail industry practice 
customer orders may be subject to cancellations or modifications and contain terms and conditions customary in the industry 
in most cases  little variation has been experienced between the quantity ordered and the quantity actually delivered 
our total manufacturing backlog of railcar units as of august  was approximately  units with an estimated value of billion compared to  units with an estimated value of billion as of august  currently  the entire backlog is expected to be sold to third parties  therefore no orders in our backlog are expected to be placed into our owned lease fleet 
a portion of the orders included in backlog reflects an assumed product mix 
under terms of the orders  the exact mix will be determined in the future which may impact the dollar amount of backlog 
our backlog of railcar units and marine vessels is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
subsequent to year end we received new railcar orders for  units valued at approximately million 
the new orders referenced are subject to customary documentation and completion of terms 
marine backlog as of august  was approximately million compared to million as of august  in addition  during the fourth quarter of we became party to a letter of intent for barges valued at million subject to significant permitting and other conditions 
during  we implemented a restructuring plan to sell or close certain wheels  repair parts facilities to enhance margins and improve capital efficiency 
restructuring charges related to this plan were million million  net of tax for the year ended august  we anticipate we will incur additional pre tax cash restructuring charges of about million over the next quarters 
this range does not include future non cash gains or losses from facilities reductions  as these are amounts are not presently determinable 
the results of our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of indicated that the carrying amount related to wheels  repair parts was in excess of fair value 
as a result  a non cash impairment loss was recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
a non cash impairment charge of million million  net of tax was recorded for the year ended august  after the goodwill impairment charge  a balance of million remained in goodwill related to wheels  repair parts as of august  in october  the board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to million of our company s common stock 
under the share buyback program  shares of common stock may be purchased on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time 
the timing and amount of purchases will be based upon market conditions  securities law limitations and other factors 
the share buyback program does not obligate our company to acquire any specific number of shares in any period 
the share buyback program expires april   but may be modified  suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents we operate two manufacturing facilities in sahagun  mexico  one of which we own and one which is leased 
in september  we were notified by the landlord of our leased facility that the landlord does not intend to renew the lease following the expiration of the lease term in november while we continue to discuss the potential extension of the lease  we are also planning for alternatives to replace the manufacturing capacity of such facility  including potentially through expanding production capacity at our owned facility in sahagun  mexico or at other manufacturing sites 
results of operations the accounting policies of the three segments in which we operate are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies 
segment performance is evaluated based on margin 
the company s integrated business model results in selling and administrative costs being intertwined among the segments 
currently  greenbrier s management does not allocate these costs for either external or internal reporting purposes

the increase in revenue for the year ended august  was primarily the result of higher levels of activity associated with the economic recovery in the freight car market including higher railcar deliveries as a result of increased demand 
the decrease in net earnings for the year ended august  was primarily attributable to a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  net of tax and restructuring charges of million  net of tax 
these were partially offset by an increase in gain on disposition of equipment

table of contents the year ended august  was primarily attributable to an increase in manufacturing margin in and loss on extinguishment of debt recognized in these factors were partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs associated with operating at higher production levels in manufacturing segment manufacturing revenue was billion  billion and million for the years ended august   and railcar deliveries  which are the primary source of manufacturing revenue  were  units in compared to  units in and  units in manufacturing revenue decreased million in compared to primarily due to a lower volume of deliveries as compared to the prior year 
these lower deliveries were a result of a change in product mix to more labor intensive railcar types and lower than expected demand for certain of our products 
these factors were partially offset by a higher per unit average selling price as a result of a change in product mix and an increase in marine revenue from the prior year 
manufacturing revenue increased million in compared to primarily due to higher railcar deliveries as a result of increased demand and a higher per unit average selling price principally due to a change in product mix 
manufacturing margin as a percentage of revenue was in  in and in the increase in compared to was primarily the result of a favorable change in product mix and an increase in marine revenue 
these factors were partially offset by inefficiencies with ramping up tank car production 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of efficiencies from operating at higher production rates and a more favorable pricing environment 
in addition  was impacted by inefficiencies as we ramped up production at idle facilities 
wheels  repair parts segment wheels  repair parts revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million decrease in revenue in compared to was primarily the result of lower demand for wheel set replacements and a decrease in scrap metal pricing and volume 
these were partially offset by an increase in demand for repair work

wheels  repair parts margin as a percentage of revenue was for  for and for the decrease in margin as a percentage of revenue in compared to was primarily the result of inefficiencies from operating at lower wheel volumes and inefficiencies at certain underperforming facilities 
these were partially offset by a favorable change in parts product mix 
during  we recorded adjustments to certain balance sheet accounts which related to prior years activities related to our mexico city facility 
the results for the year ended august  included a charge of million within cost of revenue to correct for the error 
included an increase in warranty and related costs associated with replacing a number of wheel sets produced at our mexico city wheel shop which did not conform to american association of railroads mounting standards 
the decrease in compared to was primarily the result of a change in sales mix  operating inefficiencies in repair and refurbishment as we trained new employees and an increase in warranty and related costs associated with replacing a number of wheel sets produced at our mexico city wheel shop as previously discussed 
leasing services segment leasing services revenue was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the million decrease in revenue in compared to was primarily the result of lower average volumes of rent producing leased railcars for syndication and a decrease in earnings on mileage utilization leases 
these were partially offset by an increase in management services revenue primarily due to the addition of new management service agreements 
the million increase in revenue in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in the size of the owned leased fleet and higher rents earned on increased volumes of leased railcars for syndication  partially offset by the expiration of a certain management services contract in the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents leasing services margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in and in the increase in compared to was primarily the result of a reduction in the maintenance accrual on terminated maintenance management agreements and a receipt of a settlement on a terminated railcar lease agreement 
these were partially offset by lower average volumes of rent producing leased railcars for syndication 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of more favorable lease rates and higher rents earned on increased volumes of leased railcars for syndication  which was partially offset by the expiration of a certain management services contract in the percentage of owned units on lease as of august  was compared to at august  and at august  selling and administrative selling and administrative expense was million  or of revenue for the year ended august   million  or of revenue for the year ended august  and million  or of revenue  for the year ended august  the million decrease in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in incentive compensation costs 
the million increase in compared to was primarily due to higher employee related costs including incentive compensation associated with increased levels of activity and profitability 
in addition  the revenue based administrative fees paid to our joint venture partner in mexico in increased due to higher activity levels 
revenue based fees paid to our joint venture partner in mexico were million  million and million for the years ended august   and net gain on disposition of equipment net gain on disposition of equipment was million  million and million for the years ended august   and the gain for the year ended august  consists of million in gains realized on the disposition of leased assets  a million other gain and a million loss related to the sale of certain assets from our roller bearing operation in elizabethtown  kentucky 
the entire gain for the year ended august  was realized on the disposition of leased assets 
the gain for the year ended august  consists of million gain realized on the disposition of leased assets and a million gain on insurance proceeds related to the january fire at one of our wheels  repair parts facilities 
the increase in gains realized on disposition of leased assets for the year ended august  as compared to prior years reflect refinements of our leasing model as part of our previously announced strategic initiative to liberate capital 
assets from greenbrier s lease fleet are periodically sold in the normal course of business in order to take advantage of market conditions and manage risk and liquidity 
goodwill impairment the results of our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of indicated that the carrying amount related to wheels  repair parts were in excess of fair value 
as a result  a non cash impairment loss was recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
a non cash impairment charge of million million  net of tax was recorded for the year ended august  the primary drivers of the impairment charge were lower than expected operating results  changes in forecasted future results  accompanied by a reduction in observed market multiples 
restructuring charges during  we implemented a restructuring plan to sell or close certain wheels  repair parts facilities to enhance margins and improve capital efficiency 
restructuring charges related to this plan totaled million for the year ended august  and consisted of employee related termination costs  contract termination expenses and other costs 
we anticipate we will incur additional pre tax cash restructuring charges of about million over the next quarters 
this range does not include future non cash gains or losses from facilities reductions  as these are amounts are not presently determinable

advances under this facility bear interest at libor plus or prime plus depending on the type of borrowing 
available borrowings under the credit facility are generally based on defined levels of inventory  receivables  property  plant and equipment and leased equipment  as well as total debt to consolidated capitalization and fixed charges coverage ratios 
as of august   lines of credit totaling million secured by certain of our european assets  with various variable rates that range from warsaw interbank offered rate wibor plus to wibor plus  were available for working capital needs of the european manufacturing operation 
european credit facilities are continually being renewed 
currently these european credit facilities have maturities that range from december through june as of august  our mexican joint venture had two lines of credit totaling million 
the first line of credit provides up to million and is secured by certain of the joint venture s accounts receivable and inventory 
advances under this facility bear interest at libor plus 
the mexican joint venture will be able to draw amounts available under this facility through december this line of credit expires annually and we anticipate renewing it on normal terms prior to expiration

table of contents we have operations in mexico and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with established financial institutions to protect the margin on a portion of foreign currency sales in firm backlog primarily in euro 
no provision has been made for credit loss due to counterparty non performance 
as of august   the mexican joint venture had million of third party debt  of which we have guaranteed approximately million 
in addition  we  along with our joint venture partner  have committed to contributing million to fund the capital expenditures to expand production capacity  of which we and our joint venture partner will each contribute 
these amounts will be contributed at various intervals from may  to october  as of august   we and our joint venture partner have each contributed million 
in accordance with customary business practices in europe  we have million in bank and third party warranty and performance guarantee facilities as of august  to date no amounts have been drawn under these guarantee facilities 
we expect existing funds and cash generated from operations  together with proceeds from financing activities including borrowings under existing credit facilities and long term financings  to be sufficient to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and expected debt repayments for the next twelve months 
the following table shows our estimated future contractual cash obligations as of august  years ending august  in thousands total thereafter notes payable interest revolving notes operating leases railcar leases other a portion of the estimated future cash obligation relates to interest on variable rate borrowings 
due to uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at august   we are unable to estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  approximately million in uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the contractual table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates may affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities within the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position taken in preparation of a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different than that taken by us  differences in tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount is reasonably estimable 
valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets is based on the information available at the time the financial statements are prepared and may include estimates of future income and other assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
maintenance obligations we are responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the underlying lease or management agreement 
the estimated maintenance liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of railcar 
these estimates involve judgment as to the future costs of repairs and the types and timing of repairs required over the lease term 
as we cannot predict with certainty the prices  timing and volume of maintenance needed in the future on railcars under long term leases  this estimate is uncertain and could be materially different from maintenance requirements 
the liability is periodically reviewed and updated based on maintenance trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements 
these adjustments could be material due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting future maintenance requirements 
warranty accruals warranty costs to cover a defined warranty period are estimated and charged to operations 
the estimated warranty cost is based on historical warranty claims for each particular product type 
for new product types without a warranty history  preliminary estimates are based on historical information for similar product types 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they are based on historical data for existing products and judgment for new products 
if warranty claims are made in the current period for issues that have not historically been the subject of warranty claims and were not taken into consideration in establishing the accrual or if claims for issues already considered in establishing the accrual exceed expectations  warranty expense may exceed the accrual for that particular product 
conversely  there is the possibility that claims may be lower than estimates 
the warranty accrual is periodically reviewed and updated based on warranty trends 
however  as we cannot predict future claims  the potential exists for the difference in any one reporting period to be material 
environmental costs at times we may be involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters 
we estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information 
if further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these reserves  the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which reserves are established are made 
due to the uncertain nature of estimating potential environmental matters  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or  if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
railcars are generally manufactured  repaired or refurbished and wheels and parts produced under firm orders from third parties 
revenue is recognized when these products or services are completed  accepted by an unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed 
certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is earned based on utilization  car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement 
car hire revenue is reported from a third party source two months in arrears  however  such revenue the greenbrier companies annual report 
table of contents is accrued in the month earned based on estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to actual as reported 
these estimates are inherently uncertain as they involve judgment as to the estimated use of each railcar 
adjustments to actual have historically not been significant 
revenues from construction of marine barges are either recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period or on the completed contract method based on the terms of the contract 
under the percentage of completion method  judgment is used to determine a definitive threshold against which progress towards completion can be measured to determine timing of revenue recognition 
we sell railcars with leases attached to financial investors 
in addition we will often perform management or maintenance services at market rates for these railcars 
pursuant to the guidance in asc  we evaluate the terms of any remarketing agreements and any contractual provisions that represent retained risk and the level of retained risk based on those provisions 
we apply a threshold to determine whether the level of retained risk exceeds of the individual fair value of the railcars delivered 
for any contracts with multiple elements ie railcars  maintenance  management services  etc we allocate revenue among the deliverables primarily based upon objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each element in the arrangement 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available  we will use the element s estimated selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements 
impairment of long lived assets when changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets are evaluated for impairment 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value is recognized in the current period 
these estimates are based on the best information available at the time of the impairment and could be materially different if circumstances change 
if the forecast undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the assets it would indicate that the assets were not impaired 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we periodically acquire businesses in purchase transactions in which the allocation of the purchase price may result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the amount of future period amortization and possible impairment charges 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually during the third quarter 
goodwill is also tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists 
when changes in circumstances  such as a decline in the market price of our common stock  changes in demand or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments  assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of goodwill indicate the carrying amount of certain indefinite lived assets may not be recoverable  the assets are evaluated for impairment 
among other things  our assumptions used in the valuation of goodwill include growth of revenue and margins  market multiples  discount rates and increased cash flows over time 
if actual operating results were to differ from these assumptions  it may result in an impairment of our goodwill 
the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on observed market multiples for comparable businesses 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required only in situations where the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value as determined in the first step 
in the second step we would compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
a non cash impairment charge of million million  net of tax was recorded for the the greenbrier companies annual report

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have operations in mexico and poland that conduct business in their local currencies as well as other regional currencies 
to mitigate the exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each entity  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect the margin on a portion of forecast foreign currency sales 
at august   million of forecast sales in europe were hedged by foreign exchange contracts 
because of the variety of currencies in which purchases and sales are transacted and the interaction between currency rates  it is not possible to predict the impact a movement in a single foreign currency exchange rate would have on future operating results 
in addition to exposure to transaction gains or losses  we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to the net asset position of our foreign subsidiaries 
at august   net assets of foreign subsidiaries aggregated million and a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies would result in a decrease in equity of million  or of total equity greenbrier 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
interest rate risk we have managed a portion of our variable rate debt with interest rate swap agreements  effectively converting million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as a result  we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our revolving debt and a portion of term debt  which are at variable rates 
at august   of our outstanding debt has fixed rates and has variable rates 
at august   a uniform increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional annual interest expense
