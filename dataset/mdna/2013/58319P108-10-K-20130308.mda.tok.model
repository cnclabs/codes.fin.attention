item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  you should carefully consider the following risk factors  categorized by risks related to our business  risks related to our industry and risks related to our common stock  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations in future periods 
risks related to our business actual loss and loss adjustment expenses may exceed our reserve estimates  which would negatively impact our profitability and financial position 
in many cases  several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to us and our payment of the loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the related loss adjustment expenses 
loss reserves are an estimate of what we anticipate the ultimate costs to be and therefore do not represent an exact calculation of liabilities 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult and complex process involving many variables and subjective judgments 
as part of the reserving process  we review historical data and consider the impact of various factors such as actuarial and statistical projections of the cost of settlement and administration of claims reflecting facts and circumstances then known  historical claims information and loss emergence patterns  assessments of currently available data  estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  economic factors such as inflation  judicial theories of liability  estimates and assumptions regarding social  judicial and legislative trends  and actions such as class action lawsuits and judicial interpretation of coverages or policy exclusions  and the level of insurance fraud 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future results 
it also assumes that adequate historical or other data exists upon which to make these judgments 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves and actual results are likely to differ from original estimates 
if the actual amount of insured losses is greater than our reserve estimates  our profitability  capital and financial position could suffer 
in addition  if our loss reserves are inadequate to cover the actual amount of insured losses  our financial strength rating or the financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries could be downgraded 
an increase in reserves may also require us to write off a portion of our deferred acquisition costs asset  which would also negatively impact our operating results and financial position 
in  we experienced material reserve strengthening because of significant adverse loss development primarily in commercial multiple peril  workers compensation and commercial auto lines and in the second and third quarters of  we took charges of million and million  respectively 
additional information relating to our reserves is included within the losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables section of note summary of significant accounting policies and note liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as well as to the critical accounting policies section and the reserves section of item  management s discussion and analysis 
there can be no assurance that we will not in the future experience further significant adverse loss development that could result in further reserve strengthening and additional material charges to earnings 
a decrease in our am best rating could negatively affect our business 
financial ratings are an important factor influencing the competitive position of insurance companies 
insurance companies are subject to financial strength ratings produced by external rating agencies 
higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
ratings are assigned by rating agencies to insurers based upon factors they believe are important to policyholders 
ratings evaluations are not directed to potential purchasers of our common stock and are not recommendations to buy  hold  or sell our securities 
our ability to write business is most influenced by our rating from am best 
am best ratings are designed to assess an insurer s financial strength and ability to meet continuing obligations to policyholders 
currently  our financial strength rating from am best is a excellent for our insurance company subsidiaries 
on october   following announcement of our third quarter results  am best placed under review with negative implications the financial strength rating of a excellent and issuer credit ratings of a of the subsidiaries of the company  which operate under an intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 
am best also has placed under review with negative implications the issuer credit rating of bbb of the company 
am best announced on march  that they will maintain their under review status with negative implications as they continue to evaluate the company s corrective actions 
as a result  the negative implications remain today 
we cannot be sure that further actions  if any  that we take to improve our capital position will be sufficient to maintain our current ratings 
in addition  any further adverse loss development or other developments in the future could result in further rating actions 
a rating downgrade from am best could materially adversely affect the business we write and our results of operations 
our failure to maintain our ratings  or any other adverse development with respect to our ratings  could cause our current and future independent agents and insureds to choose to transact their business with more highly rated competitors 
such a downgrade could result in a significant reduction in the number of insurance contracts we write and the loss of substantial business to our competitors that maintain higher ratings  which would cause premiums and earnings to decrease 
in addition  a downgrade could negatively impact our ability to raise capital and have a negative impact on our overall liquidity 
financial strength ratings by rating agencies are not ratings of securities or recommendations to buy  hold or sell any security and should not be relied upon as such 
we face competitive pressures in our business that could cause our revenues to decline and adversely affect our profitability 
we compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and may enjoy better name recognition  substantially greater financial resources  higher ratings by rating agencies  broader and more diversified product lines and more widespread agency relationships than us 
insurers in our markets generally compete on the basis of price  consumer recognition  coverages offered  claims handling  financial stability  customer service and geographic coverage 
although pricing is influenced to some degree by that of our competitors  it is not in our best interests to compete solely on price  and we may from time to time experience a loss of market share during period of intense price competition 
a number of new  proposed or potential legislative or industry developments could further increase competition in our industry including  but not limited to the formation of new insurers and an influx of new capital in the marketplace as existing companies attempt to expand their business as a result of better pricing and or terms or the offering of similar or better products at or below our prices  programs in which state sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas  other alternative market types of coverage  or other non property insurance  and changing practices created by the internet  which has increased competition within the insurance business 
new competition resulting from these and other developments could make the property and casualty insurance marketplace more competitive by increasing the supply of insurance capacity 
in that event  the current market may soften further  and it may negatively influence our ability to maintain or increase rates 
consequently  our profitability could be adversely impacted by increased competition 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  have been negotiated to limit our exposure to certain types of risks and expanding theories of legal liability 
in addition  many of our policies limit the period during which a policyholder may bring a claim under the policy  which period in many cases is shorter than the statutory period under which these claims can be brought by our policyholders 
while these exclusions and limitations help us assess and control our loss exposure  it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion  or legislation could be enacted that modifies or voids the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
such actions could result in higher than anticipated losses and lae by extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increasing the number or size of claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance policies that are affected by the changes and litigation relating to the insurance policy interpretation has been resolved 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a policy is issued 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
our geographic concentration ties our performance to the business  economic  natural perils  man made perils  and regulatory conditions within our most concentrated region 
our revenues and profitability are subject to the prevailing regulatory  legal  economic  political  demographic  competitive  weather and other conditions in the principal states in which we do business 
changes in any of these conditions could make it less attractive for us to do business in such states and would have a more pronounced effect on us compared to companies that are more geographically diversified 
in addition  our exposure to severe losses from localized perils  such as earthquakes  hurricanes  tropical storms  tornadoes  wind  ice storms  hail  fires  terrorism  riots and explosions  is increased in those areas where we have written significant numbers of insurance policies 
one of our predominate lines of business is workers compensation of net earned premiums in  which has a high concentration in california 
accordingly  unfavorable business  economic or regulatory conditions in this state could negatively impact our business 
california is also exposed to climate and environmental changes  natural perils such as earthquakes  water supplies  and the possibility of pandemics or terrorist acts 
because our business is concentrated in this manner  we may be exposed to economic and regulatory risks or risk from natural perils that are greater than the risks associated with greater geographic diversification 
refer to note 
reinsurance for further information regarding our reinsurance structure related to workers compensation business 
our success depends on our ability to appropriately price the risks we underwrite 
our financial results depend on our ability to underwrite and collect adequate premium rates for a wide variety of risks 
rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses  loss expenses  and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
to price our products accurately  we must collect and properly analyze a substantial amount of data  develop  test and apply appropriate rating formulas  monitor and react to changes in trends and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy 
these activities are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside our control  including availability of sufficient reliable data and our ability to properly analyze available data  uncertainties that inherently characterize estimates and assumptions  selection and application of appropriate rating and pricing techniques  changes in legal standards  claim settlement practices  medical care expenses and restoration costs  changes in mandated rates or benefits set by the state regulators  and legislative actions 
consequently  we could underprice risks  which would negatively affect our profit margins  or we could overprice risks  which could reduce our sales volume and competitiveness 
in either event  our profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
we are exposed to goodwill impairment risk as part of our growth strategy 
goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition 
we are required to perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired  we would be required to write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment  with a corresponding charge to net income 
such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  capital and financial position 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
if market conditions cause our reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable  we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for significant amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries  especially for the excess of loss and severity risks 
we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk we have written known as ceding to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk under pro rata and excess of loss contracts 
these reinsurance arrangements are intended to diversify our business and reduce our exposure to large losses or from hazards of an unusual nature 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase  which may affect the level of our business and profitability 
our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal 
we may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or to obtain other reinsurance in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
increases in the cost of reinsurance would adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance on favorable terms  either our net exposure to risk would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures  we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite 
our reinsurers may not pay on losses in a timely fashion  or at all  which may cause a substantial loss and increase our costs 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred  the ceding of insurance does not discharge us of our primary liability to our policyholder 
as a result  ceded reinsurance arrangements do not limit our ultimate obligations to policyholders to pay claims 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
we are also subject to the risk that their reinsurers may dispute their obligations to pay our claims 
in addition  our reinsurance agreements are subject to specified limits and we would not have reinsurance coverage to the extent that it exceeds those limits 
should an unlikely event occur that exceeds our reinsurance coverage  then the amounts in excess of our reinsurance coverage could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 
in order to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies  we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor the economic characteristics of the reinsurers on an ongoing basis and  if appropriate  we may require trust agreements to collateralize reinsurers financial obligation to us 
nevertheless  if our reinsurers fail to pay us or fail to pay on a timely basis  our financial results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes 
our investment portfolio is predominantly comprised of fixed income securities 
these securities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
an increase in interest rates typically reduces the fair market value of fixed income securities 
in addition  if interest rates decline  investment income earned from future investments in fixed income securities will be lower 
we generally hold our fixed income securities to maturity  so our interest rate exposure does not usually result in realized losses 
however  as noted above  rising interest rates could result in a significant reduction of our book value 
a low investment yield environment could adversely impact our net earnings  as a result of fixed income securities maturing and being replaced with lower yielding securities which impact investing results 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control including general economic conditions  governmental monetary policy  and political conditions 
as discussed above  fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our business 
see item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion on interest rate risk 
continued difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
recently  concerns over the slow economic recovery  level of us national debt  the us mortgage market  inflation levels  energy costs and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and global capital markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  reduced business and consumer confidence and continued high unemployment  have negatively impacted the us economy 
although liquidity has improved  the market for fixed income instruments continues to experience some price volatility  credit downgrade events and elevated probabilities of default 
factors such as consumer spending  business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  investor and consumer confidence and inflation levels all affect the business and economic environment and  ultimately  the amount and profitability of our business 
in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment  negative investor sentiment and lower consumer spending  the demand for our insurance products could be adversely affected 
our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether 
in addition  we may experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies 
adverse changes in the economy could negatively affect our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  continuing market turmoil has resulted in  and may continue to raise the possibility of  legislative  regulatory and governmental actions 
we cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur  or what impact  if any  such actions could have on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
even in the absence of a market downturn  our insurance products  as well as our investment returns and our access to and cost of financing  are sensitive to equity  fixed income  real estate and other market fluctuations and general economic and political conditions 
these fluctuations and conditions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
our investment portfolio is subject to market and credit risks  which could affect our financial results and ability to conduct business 
our investment portfolio is subject to overall market risk and credit risk of the individual issuers of securities 
the value of investments in marketable securities is subject to impairment as a result of deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuer 
although we try to manage this risk by diversifying our portfolio and emphasizing credit quality  our investments are subject to losses as a result of a general downturn in the economy 
a severe economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our results from operations and our financial condition 
we could be forced to sell investments to meet our liquidity requirements 
we invest the premiums we receive from customers until they are needed to pay policyholder claims or until they are recognized as profits 
consequently  we seek to match the duration of our investment portfolio with the duration of our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves to ensure strong liquidity and avoid having to liquidate securities to fund claims 
as an example  we ladder the maturities of our investment portfolio to ensure we have adequate liquidity to fund anticipated liabilities that are coming due 
risks such as inadequate loss and loss adjustment reserves or unfavorable trends in litigation could potentially result in the need to sell investments to fund these liabilities 
such sales could result in significant realized losses depending on the conditions of the general market  interest rates and credit issues with individual securities 
if we are unable to successfully introduce new products or services or fail to keep pace with advances in technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
the successful implementation of our business model depends on our ability to adapt to evolving technologies and industry standards and introduce new products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products  or that any new products will achieve market acceptance 
moreover  competitors may develop competitive products that could adversely affect our results of operations 
a failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot adapt to changing technologies  our products and services may become obsolete  and our business could suffer 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers and respond to technological advances on a timely and cost effective basis 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements  and  as a result  our business could suffer 
we are unable to predict the impact on us of the federal financial regulatory reform 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act enacted in july   expands the federal presence in insurance oversight 
the dodd frank act requirements include streamlining the state based regulation of reinsurance and nonadmitted insurance property or casualty insurance placed from insurers that are eligible to accept insurance  but are not licensed to write insurance in a particular state 
the dodd frank act also establishes a new federal insurance office within the us department of the treasury with regulatory authority over all lines of insurance except health insurance  certain long term care insurance and crop insurance 
the federal insurance office has the power to  among other things  monitor aspects of the insurance industry  identify issues in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or the overall financial system  coordinate federal policy on international insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances 
the dodd frank act provides a framework for further regulation and governance initiatives 
these regulations and initiatives cover many aspects of public company governance including  but not limited to  new and enhanced executive compensation disclosures  nonbinding stockholder votes on executive compensation  new independence standards for compensation committee membership  and incentive compensation clawback policies 
because the sec has not yet completed its required rulemaking under the dodd frank act  we are unable to predict with certainty the overall impact these new regulations and initiatives will have on us 
however  the cost of compliance with new regulations and initiatives could be significant  and adversely impact our results of operations  equity  business  and insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
our ability to meet ongoing cash requirements and pay dividends may be limited by our holding company structure and regulatory constraints restricting dividends or other distributions by our insurance company subsidiaries 
we are a holding company that transacts the majority of our business through our insurance company subsidiaries 
our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt  and to pay our expenses and shareholder dividends  depends upon the dividend paying capacity of our insurance company subsidiaries 
we will be limited by the earnings of our insurance company subsidiaries  and the distribution or other payment of such earnings to it in the form of dividends  loans  advances or the reimbursement of expenses 
payments of dividends to us by our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to various business considerations and restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  and could be subject to revised restrictions in the future 
as of december   our insurance company subsidiaries were able to make distributions to us up to million without regulatory approval 
the ability to pay ordinary and extraordinary dividends must be reviewed in relation to the impact on key financial measurement ratios  including risk based capital rbc ratios and am best s capital adequacy ratio bcar  which in turn could affect our am best rating 
as a result  at times  we may not be able to receive dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries in amounts necessary to meet our debt obligations  to pay shareholder dividends on our capital stock or to pay corporate expenses 
therefore  the inability of our insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements 
failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action 
our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of their respective states of domicile and each state in which they issue policies 
any failure by one of our insurance company subsidiaries to meet minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed by applicable state law will subject it to corrective action  which may include requiring adoption of a comprehensive financial plan  revocation of its license to sell insurance products or placing the subsidiary under state regulatory control 
a decline in the risk based capital ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries could limit their ability to pay dividends to us 
any new minimum capital and surplus requirements adopted in the future may require us to increase the capital and surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries  which we may not be able to do 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
to the extent that our present capital is insufficient to meet future operating requirements and or cover losses  we may need to raise additional funds through financings 
if we had to raise additional capital  equity or debt financing may not be available or may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the shares currently outstanding 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties  which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits 
at times  we may investigate and pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe such opportunities are consistent with our long term objectives and that the expected benefits exceed the risks 
achieving such benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties  including whether the combined businesses are integrated in an efficient and effective manner  assumption of unknown material liabilities  including deficient provisions for unpaid claims  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  failure to achieve financial or operating objectives  potential loss of policyholders or key employees of acquired companies  and general competitive factors in the marketplace 
we believe we have a robust due diligence process  however  integrating an acquired company or business can be a complex and costly endeavor 
integration may result in the loss of key employees  disruption to the existing business or the business of the acquired company  or otherwise harm our ability to retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
also  the negative effect of any financial commitments required by regulatory authorities or rating agencies in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected 
we may be unable to integrate or profitably operate any business  operations  personnel  services or products that we may acquire in the future  which could materially impact our projected benefits from the transaction  business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
our reliance upon producers subjects us to their credit risk 
with respect to agency billed premiums and premiums generated by brokers  producers collect premiums from the policyholders and forward them to us 
we rely  and will continue to rely  heavily on these producers to attract new business 
independent producers generally have the ability to bind insurance policies and collect premiums on our behalf  actions over which we have a limited ability to exercise preventative control 
in the event that an independent agent exceeds its authority by binding us to a risk that does not comply with our underwriting guidelines  we may be at risk for that policy until we effect a cancellation 
any improper use of such authority may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in certain jurisdictions  when the insured pays premium for these policies to producers for payment  the premium might be considered to have been paid under applicable insurance laws and the insured will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premium from the producer 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with producers 
although producers failures to remit premiums to us have not caused a material adverse impact on us to date  there may be instances where producers collect premium but do not remit it to us and we may be required under applicable law to provide the coverage set forth in the policy despite the actual lack of collection of the premium by us 
because the possibility of these events is dependent in large part upon the financial condition  cash flows  and internal operations of our producers  we may not be able to quantify any potential exposure presented by the risk 
if we are unable to collect premium from our producers in the future  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
one of our core selected producers accounts for a large portion of our premium volume  loss of business provided by this entity could adversely affect us 
our largest producer in was midwest general insurance agency  llc midwest general  which in combination with its affiliates  accounted for of our gross written premium 
no other producer was responsible for more than of our gross written premium 
we do not have an exclusive relationship with midwest general  and there can be no assurance that this relationship will continue in the future 
if midwest general reduces its marketing of our products or moves some or all of its business to another carrier  then our business  investment financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our performance is dependent on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to retain and motivate our senior management and key management personnel and their efforts 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have existing employment or severance agreements with robert s 
cubbin  christopher j 
timm  karen m 
spaun  michael g 
costello  and other senior executives 
we maintain a key person life insurance policy on robert s 
cubbin  our president and ceo 
the loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could cause our ability to implement our business strategies to be delayed or hindered 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain other highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  and customer service personnel 
competition for these employees is strong and we may not be able to successfully attract  integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel 
in addition  our future success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate our agents and other producers 
our failure to attract and retain the necessary personnel and producers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems to conduct our business 
our business is dependent upon the uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunication systems 
we rely upon our systems  as well as the systems of our vendors  to underwrite and process our business  make claim payments  provide customer service  provide policy administration services  such as endorsements  cancellations and premium collections  comply with insurance regulatory requirements  and perform actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for pricing and product development 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to timely and efficiently process our business and protect our information and telecommunications systems from physical loss  telecommunications failure or other similar catastrophic events  as well as from security breaches 
while we have implemented business contingency plans and other reasonable and appropriate internal controls to protect our systems from interruption  loss or security breaches  a sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to process our business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 
likewise  a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation in the event confidential customer information is disclosed to third parties 
we could also be subject to fines and penalties from a security breach 
the cost to remedy a severe security breach could also be substantial 
these circumstances could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and reputation 
managing technology initiatives and obtaining the efficiencies anticipated with technology implementation may present significant challenges 
while technological enhancements and initiatives can streamline several business processes and ultimately reduce the costs of operations  these initiatives can present short term costs and implementation risks 
projections of associated costs  implementation timelines  and the benefits of those results may be inaccurate and such inaccuracies could increase over time 
in addition  there are risks associated with not achieving the anticipated efficiencies from technology implementation that could impact our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
our internal controls are not fail safe 
we continually enhance our operating procedures and internal controls to effectively support our business and comply with our regulatory and financial reporting requirements 
as a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control objectives have been or will be met  and that every instance of error or fraud has been or will be detected 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by individual acts or by collusion of two or more persons 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
internal controls may also become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate 
further  the design of a control system must reflect resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
as a result of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatement due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
accordingly  our internal controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control objectives are met

risks related to our industry and our regulatory and litigation environment the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical in nature  which may affect our overall financial performance 
historically  the financial performance of the property and casualty insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition  excess capacity and lower levels of profitability known as a soft market followed by periods of high premium rates  shortages of underwriting capacity  and higher levels of profitability known as a hard market 
although an individual insurance company s financial performance is dependent on its own specific business characteristics  the profitability of most property and casualty insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern 
specific factors that can drive the industry s profitability include rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products  volatile and unpredictable developments  including man made  weather related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks  changes in loss reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurer s liability develop  fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested assets and may impact the ultimate payout of losses  and increases in medical costs beyond historic or expected annual inflationary levels 
because the cyclicality of our industry is due in large part to the actions of competitors and general economic conditions  we cannot predict with certainty the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle 
we have been in a prolonged soft market and cannot necessarily predict how long it will take to harden 
severe weather conditions and other catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and could cause us to suffer material financial losses 
the majority of our property business is exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including natural events  such as hurricanes  winter weather  tornadoes  windstorms  earthquakes  hailstorms  severe thunderstorms and fires  and other events  such as explosions  terrorist attacks and riots 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes and severe weather conditions are inherently unpredictable 
generally these losses result in an increase in the number of claims incurred as well as the amount of compensation sought by claimants 
one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
along with other insurers in the industry  we use models in assessing our exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios 
however  these models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred 
catastrophe models use historical information about various catastrophes and detailed information about our in force business 
while we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities  there are limitations with respect to their usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period 
such limitations lead to questionable predictive capability and post event measurements that have not been well understood or proven to be sufficiently reliable 
in addition  the models are not necessarily reflective of our or state specific policy language  demand surge for labor and materials or loss settlement expenses  all of which are subject to wide variation by catastrophe 
litigation may have an adverse effect on our business meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
we are subject at times to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors or omissions in the placement of insurance  claims administration  consulting services and other business transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 
where appropriate  we vigorously defend such claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
some of these claims  lawsuits and proceedings seek damages  including consequential  exemplary  or punitive damages  in amounts that could  if awarded  be significant 
most of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by the policy at issue  errors and omissions insurance or other appropriate insurance 
in terms of any retentions or deductibles associated with such insurance  we have established accruals for such retentions or deductibles  when necessary  based upon current available information 
with the assistance of outside counsel  we adjust such provisions according to new developments or changes in the strategy in dealing with such matters 
on the basis of current information  we do not expect the outcome of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to  either individually  or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of any such matters 
because we are heavily regulated by the states in which we operate  we may be limited in the way we operate 
we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we operate 
the supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition 
the primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is to maintain compliance with insurance regulations and to protect policyholders 
the extent of regulation varies  but generally is governed by state statutes 
these statutes delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments 
this system of regulation covers  among other things standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the types of terms that we can include in the insurance policies we offer  restrictions on our ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas  required methods of accounting  required reserves for unearned premiums  losses and other purposes  permissible underwriting and claims settlement practices  assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain insurance policies provided by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies  approval of policy forms and rates  and restrictions on transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates 
the regulations of the state insurance departments may affect the cost or demand for our products and may impede us from obtaining rate increases or taking other actions we might wish to take to increase our profitability 
furthermore  we may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations 
also  regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals  or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could stop or temporarily suspend us from conducting some or all of our activities or monetarily penalize us 
in addition  state regulators and the naic regularly examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies 
changes in these laws and regulations or the interpretations thereof could adversely impact our business 
although the united states federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business  changes in federal legislation  regulation  and or administrative policies in several areas  including changes in financial services regulation and federal taxation  can significantly harm the insurance industry 
most states assess our insurance company subsidiaries to provide funds for failing insurance companies and those assessments could be material 
our insurance company subsidiaries are subject to assessments in most states where we are licensed for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired  insolvent or failed insurance companies 
these assessments  which are levied by guaranty associations within the state  up to prescribed limits  are imposed on all member insurers in the applicable state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insures in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer was engaged 
accordingly  the assessments levied on us by the states in which we are licensed to write insurance may increase as we increase our premiums written 
maximum contributions required by law in any one year vary by state  and have historically been less than one percent of annual premiums written 
in addition  as a condition to the ability to conduct business in certain states  insurance companies are required to participate in mandatory reinsurance funds 
we cannot predict with certainty the amount of future assessments or level of participation in mandatory reinsurance funds 
significant assessments and the effect of mandatory reinsurance arrangements  or changes therein  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

provisions of the michigan business corporation act  our articles of incorporation and other corporate governing documents and the insurance laws may discourage takeover attempts 
the michigan business corporation act contains anti takeover provisions 
chapter a the fair price act of the business corporation act applies to us and may have an anti takeover effect and may delay  defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in their best interest  including those attempts that might result in shareholders receiving a premium over market price for their shares 
in general  subject to certain exceptions  the fair price act prohibits a michigan corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of five years following the date that such shareholder became an interested shareholder  unless i prior to such date  the board of directors approved the business combination or ii on or subsequent to such date  the business combination is approved by at least of the votes of each class of the corporation s stock entitled to vote and by at least two thirds of such voting stock not held by the interested shareholder or such shareholder s affiliates 
the fair price act defines a business combination to include certain mergers  consolidations  dispositions of assets or shares and recapitalizations 
an interested shareholder is defined by the fair price act to include a beneficial owner  directly or indirectly  of or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation 
our articles of incorporation allow our board of directors to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock with voting rights  preferences and other privileges as the board of directors may determine 
the possible issuance of preferred shares could adversely affect the holders of our common stock and could prevent  delay  or defer a change of control 
we are also subject to the laws of michigan  ohio  texas  california  washington dc  missouri  and other states  which govern insurance holding companies 
under these laws  a person generally must obtain the applicable insurance department s approval to acquire  directly or indirectly  five to ten percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of our insurance company subsidiaries 
an insurance department s determination of whether to approve an acquisition would be based on a variety of factors  including an evaluation of the acquirer s financial stability  the competence of its management  and whether competition in that state would be reduced 
these laws may prevent  delay or defer a change of control of us or our insurance company subsidiaries

critical accounting policies general in certain circumstances  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on a variety of factors 
there can be no assurance  however  the actual results will not be materially different than our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be affected by accounting adjustments needed to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following policies  along with those disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies  are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of a loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and lae 
we establish a liability for losses and lae  which represents case based estimates of reported unpaid losses and lae and actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported losses ibnr and lae 
such liabilities  by necessity  are based upon estimates and  while we believe the amount of our reserves is adequate  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimate 
as of december  and  we have accrued  million and  million of gross loss and lae reserves  respectively 
components of losses and loss adjustment expense meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the following table sets forth our gross and net reserves for losses and lae based upon an underlying source of data  at december  in thousands case ibnr total direct assumed directly managed assumed residual markets assumed mfh assumed other gross less ceded net directly managed represents business managed and processed by our underwriting  claims  and loss control departments  utilizing our internal systems and related controls 
residual markets represent mandatory pooled workers compensation business allocated to individual insurance company writers based on the insurer s market share in a given state 
the reserves referenced in the above table related to our direct and assumed directly managed business are established through transactions processed through our internal systems and related controls 
likewise assumed mfh is assumed business related to our partial ownership of midwest financial holdings where we have direct access to their paid and case reserve loss data 
accordingly  case reserves are established on a current basis  therefore there is no delay or lag in reporting of losses from a ceding company  and ibnr is determined utilizing various actuarial methods based upon historical data 
ultimate reserve estimates related to assumed business from residual markets are provided by individual states on a two quarter lag between the date of the evaluation and the receipt of the estimate from the national council on compensation insurance ncci  and include an estimated reserve determined based upon internal actuarial methods for this lag 
relative to assumed business from other sources  we receive case and paid loss data within a forty five day reporting period and develop our estimates for ibnr based on both current and historical data 
the completeness and accuracy of data received from cedants on assumed business that we do not manage directly is verified through monthly reconciliations to detailed statements  inception to date rollforwards of claim data  actuarial estimates of historical trends  field audits  and a series of management oversight reports on a program basis 
the following table sets forth our net case and ibnr reserves for losses and lae by line of business at december  in thousands net case net ibnr total workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total claim reserving process and methodology when a claim is reported to one of our insurance company subsidiaries  for the majority of claims  our claims personnel within our risk management subsidiary will establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  which focus on the ultimate probable cost of each reported claim  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments  new information or periodic reviews of the claims 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in addition to case reserves and in accordance with industry practice  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and lae incurred but not yet reported 
we project an estimate of ultimate losses and lae at each reporting date 
the difference between the projected ultimate loss and lae reserves and the case loss reserves and lae reserves  is carried as ibnr reserves 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we estimate the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 
in developing claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates  we perform a complete and detailed reserve analyses each quarter 
to perform this analysis  the data is organized at a reserve category level 
a reserve category can be a line of business such as commercial automobile liability  or it may be a particular geographical area within a line of business such as california workers compensation 
the reserves within a reserve category level are characterized as either short tail or long tail 
about of our reserves can be characterized as coming from long tail lines of business 
for long tail business  several years may lapse between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled 
our long tail exposures include workers compensation  commercial automobile liability  general liability  professional liability  products liability  aviation liability  excess  and umbrella 
short tail exposures include property  commercial automobile physical damage  a portion of ocean marine  and inland marine 
the analyses generally review losses both gross and net of reinsurance 
the standard actuarial methods that we use to project ultimate losses for both long tail and short tail exposures include  but are not limited to  the following paid development method incurred development method paid bornhuetter ferguson method reported bornhuetter ferguson method initial expected loss method paid roll forward method incurred roll forward method all of these methods are consistently applied to every reserve category where they are applicable and they create indications for each accident year 
we use judgment selecting the best estimate from within these estimates or adjusted estimates 
as such  no one method or group of methods is strictly used for any line of business or reserve category within a line of business 
the individual selections by year are our best judgments based on the strengths and weaknesses of the method  indications  the inherent variability in the data and the specific modifications to selections for data characteristics 
a brief description of the methods and some discussion of their inherent strengths  weaknesses and uses are as follows paid development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative paid losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs  the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes  the impact of large claim payments and other factors 
claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in the cost of wage replacement  judicial decisions  legislative changes and other factors 
because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate  changes in any of these factors can impact the results 
since the method does not rely on case reserves  it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves 
incurred development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative reported loss dollars by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment and case reserving environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued since the method uses more data case reserves in addition to paid losses than the paid development method  the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns 
however  selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis of all of the factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
in addition  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available 
paid bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year and partial weight to observed paid losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the method assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level 
the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid 
the use of the pattern from the paid development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year 
this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation 
reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to observed reported loss dollars paid losses plus case reserves 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns 
however  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place  and the method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the expected loss ratio and incurred development methods 
initial expected loss method 
this method is used directly  and as an input to the bornhuetter ferguson methods 
initial expected losses for an accident year are based on adjusting prior accident year projections to the current accident year levels using underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance structure and cost changes and other pertinent adjustments specific to the line of business 
this method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent  losses emerge very slowly  or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses 
the selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends  frequency trends  rate changes  underwriting changes  and other applicable factors 
paid roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual paid loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it is useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns 
incurred roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual case incurred loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it may also be useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns and generally reacts faster than the paid roll forward method 
claims for short tail lines of business settle more quickly than long tail lines of business  and in general  loss development factors for short tail lines are smaller than long tail lines 
for long tail lines  we tend to rely on initial expected loss methods throughout the current accident year then move to development factor based methods for older accident years 
development methods on short tail lines are generally reliable in the third and fourth quarter of the initial accident year and recorded loss ratios reflect a blend of the development and forecast methods 
short tail lines represent of our total reserves at december  the reserve categories where the above methods are not applicable are few 
the largest of these is our workers compensation residual market reserve category  where we utilize detailed reserve analyses performed by the industry statistical agency ncci in making our estimates 
we adjust these estimates for timing differences in the reporting of the data 
the other reserve categories that deviate from the above methods are smaller  as a group they constitute less than one percent of the total reserves 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued each of the methods listed above requires the selection and application of parameters and assumptions 
for all but the initial expected loss method  the key assumptions are the patterns with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time development patterns 
these patterns incorporate inherent assumptions of claims cost inflation rates and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
these are affected by underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance structure and cost changes  and other pertinent adjustments which are explicit key assumptions underlying the initial expected loss method 
each of these key assumptions is discussed in the following paragraphs 
to analyze the development patterns  we compile  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  organized in a manner which provides an indication of the historical development patterns 
to the extent that the historical data may provide insufficient information about future patterns whether due to environmental changes such as legislation or due to the small volume or short history of data for some segments of our business benchmarks based on industry data  and forecasts made by industry rating bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns  may be used to supplement  adjust  or replace patterns based on our insurance companies historical data 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed  and our views regarding current and future claim patterns are among the factors that enter into our establishment of the reserve for losses and lae at each balance sheet date 
when short term averages or external rate bureau analyses indicate the claims patterns are changing from historical company or industry patterns  the new or forecasted information typically is factored into the methodologies 
when new claims emergence or payment patterns have appeared in the actual data repeatedly over multiple evaluations  those new patterns are given greater weight in the selection process 
because some claims are paid over many years  the selection of claim emergence and payment patterns involves judgmentally estimating the manner in which recently occurring claims will develop for many years and at times  decades in the future 
when it is likely the actual development will occur in the distant future  the potential for actual development to differ substantially from historical patterns or current projections is increased 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
in particular  the development factor based methods all have as a key assumption that the development of losses in the future will follow a pattern similar to those measured by past experience and as adjusted either explicitly or by actuarial judgment 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple and varied factors 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december  and variability of claim reserve estimates by its nature  the estimate of ultimate losses and lae is subject to variability due to differences between our assumptions and actual events in the future 
although many factors influence the actual cost of claims and our corresponding reserve estimates  we do not measure and estimate values for all of these variables individually 
this is due to the fact that many of the factors known to impact the cost of claims cannot be measured directly  such as the impact on claim costs due to economic inflation  coverage interpretations  and jury determinations 
in most instances  we rely on our historical experience or industry information to estimate the values for the variables that are explicitly used in our reserve analyses 
we assume that the historical effect of these unmeasured factors  which is embedded in our experience or industry experience  is representative of the future effects of these factors 
where we have reason to expect a change in the effect of one of these factors  we perform analyses to perform the necessary adjustments 
one implicit assumption underlying development patterns is that the claims inflation trends will continue into the future similar to their past patterns 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expense payments to an unexpected change in inflationary trends  our actuarial department derives expected payment patterns separately for each major line of business 
these patterns were applied to the december  loss and settlement expense reserves to generate estimated annual incremental loss and settlement expense payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for the purpose of sensitivity testing  an explicit annual inflationary variance of one percent was added to the inflationary trend that is implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and settlement expense payments were calculated 
general inflation trends have been fairly stable over the past several years but there have been fluctuations of one to two percent over the past ten years and therefore we used a one percent annual inflation variance factor 
the effect differed by line of business but overall was a four percent change in reserve adequacy or approximately million effect on after tax net income 
a variance of this type would typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued an explicit assumption used in the analysis is the set of initial expected loss ratios ielrs used in the current accident year reserve projections and in some of the prior accident year ultimate loss indications 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss to a change in ielrs  the actuarial department recasted the loss reserve indications using a set of ielrs all one percent higher than the final ielrs 
the overall impact of a one percent change in ielrs would be a corresponding one percent change in reserve adequacy or a million effect on after tax net income 
often the loss ratios by line of business will vary from the ielr in different directions causing them to partially offset each other 
a variance of this type would typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
the other factors having influence upon the loss and lae reserve levels are too numerous and interdependent to efficiently model and test for sensitivity 
likewise  the development factors by reserve category and age are too numerous to model and test for sensitivity 
instead  ranges are estimated by reserve category considering past history  fluctuations in the development patterns  emerging issues  trends and other factors 
the ranges are compiled and the total range is estimated considering the sensitivity to all of the underlying factors together 
the resulting range is our best estimate of the expected ongoing variability in the loss reserves 
our range of loss and lae reserves table shows that presently we estimate them as going from favorable development of to unfavorable of 
the range was evaluated based on the ultimate loss estimates from the actuarial methods described above

our workers compensation reserves represent of our total reserves at december  the sensitivity around our commercial multiple peril general liability reserves primarily reflects the longer duration of reserves relating to our liability excess program  which started in and was cancelled in  and our construction defect exposure  which together represent approximately of the million reserves in this line of business as of december  these lines of business are subject to greater uncertainty than the remainder of our book of business 
the sensitivity around our commercial automobile reserves primarily reflects the speed of reporting of the underlying losses  as well as the maturity of the case law surrounding automobile liability 
the sensitivity around the other lines of business primarily reflects the size of the underlying book of business 
our other reserves represent of total reserves at december  a large portion of these reserves represent professional liability programs which tend to be claims made and reinsured at lower limits  therefore reducing the volatility that is inherent in a smaller book of business 
another large portion represents property claims  which have a shorter reporting and payout pattern than liability and workers compensation claims 
all of our reserves are sensitive to changes in the underlying claim payment and case reserving practices  as well as the other sources of variations mentioned above

management s discussion and analysis continued reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our legal liability to our insureds  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
instead of being netted against the appropriate liabilities  ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and lae are reported separately as assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance recoverable balances are also subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
in our selection of reinsurers  we continually evaluate their financial stability 
while we believe our reinsurance recoverables are collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
in our risk sharing programs  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  or on the portion of risk either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors we consider upon entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
we collateralize balances due from our risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which may be in dispute 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   we believe this allowance is adequate 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
legal contingencies we are subject at times to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors or omissions in the placement of insurance  claims administration  consulting services and other business transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 
where appropriate  we vigorously defend such claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
some of these claims  lawsuits and proceedings seek damages  including consequential  exemplary or punitive damages  in amounts that could  if awarded  be significant 
most of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by the policy at issue  errors and omissions insurance or other appropriate insurance 
in terms of any retentions or deductibles associated with such insurance  we have established accruals for such retentions or deductibles  when necessary  based upon current available information 
in accordance with accounting guidance  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss is estimable  then an accrual is provided for the costs to resolve these claims in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
period expenses related to the defense of such claims are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we  with the assistance of outside counsel  adjust such provisions according to new developments or changes in the strategy in dealing with such matters 
on the basis of current information  we do not expect the outcome of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to  either individually  or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of any such matters

we believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the net effect of realized gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments  which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
realized gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments  such as capital market conditions 
additionally  in realized gains of million were generated in part  by the sale of a portion of our investment portfolio  compared to realized gains of million and million in and  respectively 
accordingly  net operating loss income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying loss or profitability of our business

policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our expense ratio decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this improvement reflects the reduction in accrued profit sharing commission and our ability to leverage corporate overhead 
general corporate expenses increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase is due to a reduction in the performance based variable compensation accrual in amortization expense increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase is due to the million write off of an intangible asset related to the public entity excess liability program that we terminated in the fourth quarter of federal income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million  or of income before taxes  compared to an expense of million  or of income before taxes for the same period in income tax expense on net capital gains and the change in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  was million for the year ended december   compared to income tax expense on net capital gains and the change in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million for the year ended december  the unusual tax rate is primarily due to the large tax benefit generated from underwriting losses resulting from adverse loss development and storm losses offset by the tax expense on net investment income and realized gains 
the effective tax rate on net investment income was  driven by the level of tax exempt investments 
the effective tax rate on underwriting results and profits from net commissions and fees was 
the effective tax rate on realized gains  which includes the benefit from the removal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets relating to otti securities that were sold  was

management s discussion and analysis continued revenues compared to revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects overall growth within our net earned premiums 
the following table sets forth the components of revenues in thousands for the years ended december  revenue net earned premiums management administrative fees claims fees commission revenue net investment income net realized gains total revenue net earned premiums increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects the maturation of existing programs  the conversion of the existing fee based program into an insured program  rate increases that have been achieved and new business initiatives that were implemented during the past twelve months designed to develop specialty niche expertise in a range of areas 
management fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in as previously discussed  this decrease was primarily driven by the conversion of an existing fee based program into an insured program where we earn premium revenue as opposed to fees revenue 
commission revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects michigan agency business that was added in the current year 
net realized gains increased by million  to a million gain for the year ended december   from a million gain for the comparable period in the increase in realized gains relates to our efforts to generate capital gains as a result of our tax strategy to utilize the benefit from our capital tax loss carry forward

this transaction had no impact on the combined ratio or underwriting income  but did result in a percentage point increase during the year on our loss and lae ratio and a corresponding percentage point decrease on the expense ratio

management s discussion and analysis continued lae increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the accident year loss and lae ratio was for the both years ended december  and the accident year loss and lae ratio includes percentage points of higher than an expected or normal level of storm loss activity 
the higher than normal level of storm losses was partially offset by improved underwriting results as rate increases and underwriting actions begin to take effect 
excluding the higher than normal level of storm activity the accident year loss and lae ratio improved to  compared to in the prior year 
additional discussion of our reserve activity is described below within the other items reserves section 
policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our expense ratio decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this improvement reflects a reduction in variable compensation and a reduction in commission rates due to mix of business 
general  selling and administrative costs increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase relates primarily to investments in new sales initiatives to stimulate net commission and fee revenue growth  as well as a shift in certain overhead expenses from direct insurance operations to corporate overhead 
these items were partially offset by a reduction in performance based variable compensation in as compared to general corporate expenses decreased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease is due to a reduction in the performance based variable compensation accrual in the current year  as compared to accruing a provision for variable compensation in interest expense for the year ended december   decreased million  to million  from million for the comparable period in interest expense is primarily attributable to our debentures  which are described within the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis  as well as our term loan 
the overall decrease reflects the decline in the average outstanding balance on our term loan to million for the period ended december  from million for same period in federal income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  or of income before taxes  compared to million  or of income before taxes for the same period in income tax expense on net capital gains and the change in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the tax impact of net capital gains and the change in our valuation allowance  the effective income tax rate would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lower rate reflects a larger portion of taxable income coming from net investment income rather than fee based and underwriting income  which includes a portion of tax exempt investments

management s discussion and analysis continued in november  our subsidiary  century surety company  committed to a million contribution to the aquiline financial services fund ii lp as a strategic investment 
as of december   approximately million of the commitment had been satisfied with million of unfunded commitment remaining 
our ownership interest is approximately of the fund  which does not constitute significant influence  therefore  we are accounting for this investment under the equity method of accounting 
century surety company will recognize of the fund s profits and losses as a result of this equity interest ownership 
we recognized a loss to equity earnings  net of tax  from the aquiline financial services fund ii lp of million  or per dilutive share for the year ended december  reserves at december   our best estimate for the ultimate liability for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  was  million 
we established a reasonable range of reserves of approximately million to  million 
this range was established primarily by considering the various indications derived from standard actuarial techniques and other appropriate reserve considerations 
the following table sets forth this range by line of business in thousands line of business minimum reserve range maximum reserve range selected reserves workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total net reserves reserves are reviewed and established by our internal actuaries for adequacy and peer reviewed by our third party actuaries 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in our selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the twelve months ended december   and the year ended december  for the twelve months ended december   we reported an increase in net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior of million  or of million of beginning net loss and lae reserves at december  the change in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from the projected activity 
the major components of this change in ultimate loss estimates are as follows in thousands meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued incurred losses paid losses line of business reserves at december  current year prior years total incurred current year prior years total paid reserves at december  workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other net reserves reinsurance recoverable consolidated the following table shows the re estimated december  held reserves by line as of december  in thousands line of business reserves at december  total re estimated reserves at december  on prior years development as a percentage of prior year reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other sub total residual markets total net reserves workers compensation excluding residual markets the net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior in the workers compensation line of business increased million  or 
this was driven primarily by accident years   and the increase in net ultimate loss estimates was million in  million in  and million in these increases were partially offset by a reduction in net ultimate loss estimates for older accident years 
in this line of business we continue to see favorable overall underwriting trends 
the average accident year combined ratio since the beginning of was 
in california workers compensation  which represents approximately of our year to date workers compensation net earned premium  the average accident year combined ratio since the beginning of is 
our overall current accident year combined ratio for workers compensation is 
this improvement reflects the impact of cumulative rate increases of since the beginning of  with an additional filed and approved california rate increase  which became effective november  during the year  we experienced an acceleration in the claim handling process 
although the acceleration represents a deviation from standard loss development patterns  it also resulted in the recognition of some claim liabilities that were higher than anticipated in our previous reserving estimates 
this  in turn  led to an increase in the net ultimate loss estimates on prior accident years during the first three quarters 
the acceleration began to dissipate in the fourth quarter and reserves began to stabilize 
paid loss severities remain more stable and claim frequencies have decreased due to earned rate increases 
we view the paid loss severity and frequency trends  along with the rate increases that we have achieved as positive indicators for this business 
in most states  underwriting actions and rate increases have been effective and ultimate loss estimates on prior accident years have been stable meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued commercial multiple peril general liability the net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior in the commercial multi peril general liability line of business increased million  or 
this was driven primarily by accident years through the increase in net ultimate loss estimates was million for  million for  million for  million for  million for  and million for this re estimation reflects an increase in the frequency of larger claims and strengthening of case reserves relating to prior years that occurred in calendar year of the million increase in prior accident year net ultimate loss estimates  million was related to the excess liability program 
this program was cancelled in october although our ultimate loss estimates for prior years increased in  we have begun to see favorable overall underwriting trends in this line of business 
the average accident year combined ratio since the beginning of was 
our current accident year combined ratio is 
during the year  our claim managers continued to perform an exposure analysis on our larger exposure claims 
this recent initiative was designed to identify higher exposure claims earlier and focus on our investigation and defense strategies  which led to a higher level of incurred losses than indicated by our historical development patterns 
while this acceleration represents a deviation from standard loss development patterns  it also resulted in the recognition of some claim liabilities that were higher than anticipated in our previous reserving estimates 
commercial automobile the million increase  or  in net ultimate loss estimates for the commercial automobile line of business is primarily in the   and accident years and also reflects the emergence of higher than expected large loss activity 
the increase in net ultimate loss estimates was million for  million for  and million for the average accident year combined ratio since the beginning of was 
our current accident year combined ratio is 
these unfavorable results primarily reflect the impact of the transportation program and a smaller segment of another program 
the company aggressively achieved rate increases and reduced exposure on the transportation program 
despite these cumulative rate increases  which exceeded since  this program has been terminated on a go forward basis along with the smaller program mentioned above 
we believe we could see improved current accident year results for this line of business as these rate increases earn premiums in other the million increase  or  in net ultimate loss estimates in other lines of business is primarily from accident year property exposures where we had a handful of larger claims that occurred in late  but were not reported until the first quarter of the increase in net ultimate loss estimates is million in and million in these occurrences were partially offset by better than expected claim activity in our medical malpractice line of business 
cumulative rate increases in other lines since the beginning of has been approximately 
residual markets the workers compensation residual market line of business had a decrease in net ultimate loss estimate of million  or of net reserves 
this decrease reflects reductions in the net ultimate loss estimates for various accident years 
we record loss reserves as reported by the national council on compensation insurance ncci  plus a provision for the reserves incurred but not yet analyzed and reported to us due to a two quarter lag in reporting 
these changes reflect a difference between our estimate of the lag incurred but not reported and the amounts reported by the ncci in the year 
over the years  we have demonstrated an ability to remediate programs that are not meeting our targets through a combination of underwriting and pricing actions 
although we have experienced increases in net ultimate loss estimates noted above  we have made significant headway in remediating where necessary 
we will continue to earn premium that reflects the cumulative rate increases and underwriting actions  which we believe could result in an improved combined ratio 
despite the prolonged soft market and lackluster economic growth  we have had an average combined ratio of over the last six accident years and for as we emerge from an underpriced environment to more adequate pricing levels  we should see ongoing  incremental improvement in our overall underwriting results

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums  investment income  proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets from our insurance company subsidiaries  and risk management fees and agency commissions from our non regulated subsidiaries 
funds are primarily used for the payment of claims  commissions  salaries and employee benefits  other operating expenses  shareholder dividends  share repurchases  capital expenditures  and debt service 
a significant portion of our consolidated assets represents assets of our insurance company subsidiaries that may not be transferable to the holding company in the form of dividends  loans or advances in accordance with state insurance laws 
these laws generally specify that dividends can be paid only from unassigned surplus and only to the extent that all dividends in the current twelve months do not exceed the greater of of total statutory surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year or of the statutory net income for the prior year  less any dividends paid in the prior twelve months 
using these criteria  the available ordinary dividend available to be paid from the insurance company subsidiaries during was million without prior regulatory approval 
of this million  ordinary dividends of million were declared and paid as of december  in addition to ordinary dividends  the insurance company subsidiaries had the capacity to pay million of extraordinary dividends in  subject to prior regulatory approval 
in addition  the ability to pay ordinary and extraordinary dividends must be reviewed in relation to the impact on key financial measurement ratios  including risk based capital rbc ratios and bcar  which in turn may affect our am best rating 
the insurance company subsidiaries ability to pay future dividends without advance regulatory approval is dependent upon maintaining a positive level of unassigned surplus  which in turn  is dependent upon the insurance company subsidiaries generating net income 
total ordinary dividends paid from our insurance company subsidiaries to our holding company were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   on a trailing twelve month statutory consolidated basis  the gross and net premium leverage ratios were to and to  respectively 
we also generate operating cash flow from non regulated subsidiaries in the form of commission revenue  outside management fees  and intercompany management fees 
these sources of income are used to meet debt service  shareholders dividends  and other operating expenses of the holding company and non regulated subsidiaries 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization from non regulated subsidiaries were approximately million for the year ended december  we have a revolving credit facility of million 
as of december   we had a million outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and million in letters of credit issued

based on our insurance company subsidiaries membership in the fhlbi  we have the ability to borrow on a collateralized basis at relatively low borrowing rates  providing a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had borrowed million from the fhlbi 
the proceeds were used to fund purchases of high quality bonds with maturities that match the maturity of the fhlbi credit facility 
due to the low cost of the fhlbi funding  the company expects to generate returns in excess of its cost of borrowing under this strategy 
we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity through additional investments and pledging additional securities 
as of december   the company did not have any borrowings outstanding from the fhlbi 
cash flows provided by operations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in operating cash flows was driven primarily by the reduction from premium revenue as a result of the quota share reinsurance agreement that was entered into during the fourth quarter of excluding the quota share reinsurance agreement  there was an increase in operating cash flow of million more than the increase was driven primarily by higher cash flow from underwriting activities and a decrease in estimated federal income tax payments

the amount of the bonus pool is established by aggregating the individual targets for each participant  which is a percentage of salary 
an employee s actual bonus may be plus or minus his or her target based upon the company and individual s performance at the end of the year

management s discussion and analysis continued regulatory and rating issues the naic has a rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general  an insurance company must submit a calculation of its rbc formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding 
at december   each of our insurance company subsidiaries was in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required 
insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests eg  premium to statutory surplus ratios  which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies 
as of december   on a trailing twelve month statutory consolidated basis  the gross and net premium leverage ratios were to and to  respectively 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios  at an individual company  generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners 
in  our insurance company subsidiaries generated ratios that varied from the usual value range 
the variations and reasons are set forth below ratio usual range value company star adjusted liabilities to liquid assets under company procentury gross agents balances to policyholders surplus under one year reserve development to policyholders surplus under company ameritrust one year reserve development to policyholders surplus under company savers one year reserve development to policyholders surplus under company williamsburg one year reserve development to policyholders surplus under adjusted liabilities to liquid assets on star are outside the usual range primarily as a result of our intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 
the adjusted liabilities include the gross amount of reinsurance payables related to the pool and does not allow an offset to those payables for any reinsurance recoverables related to the pool 
in addition  the reinsurance recoverables are not included in the liquid assets portion of the formula 
this causes the ratio results to appear much higher due to the timing of the settlement of the pool balances 
pool balances between the entities are settled in the month following the completion of the pooling 
once the balances are settled  the ratio will be 
the gross agents balances to policyholders surplus on procentury was impacted by our intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 
the assumed premium receivable increased as a result of growth in business  thereby increasing the gross agents balances related to the pooling agreement 
excluding the intercompany pooling  this ratio would have been  well within the usual range

management s discussion and analysis continued the one year reserve development to policyholders surplus was driven by unfavorable prior year development experienced in as a result of the significant activity in on prior years  the company has taken immediate action to terminate underperforming business and has developed a business plan for moving forward 
reinsurance considerations we seek to manage the risk exposure of our insurance company subsidiaries and our clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
our reinsurance requirements are analyzed on both a specific program and line of business basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
we secure this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
in regard to our excess of loss reinsurance  we manage our credit risk on reinsurance recoverables by reviewing the financial stability  am best rating  capitalization  and credit worthiness of prospective or existing reinsurers 
we generally do not seek collateral where the reinsurer is rated a or better by a

we customarily collateralize reinsurance balances due from non admitted reinsurers through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities  which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of an asset and liability management strategy where the target duration for the fixed income portfolio is based on the estimate of the liability duration and takes into consideration our surplus 
the investment policy guidelines provide for a fixed income portfolio duration of between three and a half and five and a half years 
at december   our fixed income portfolio had an effective duration of years compared to years at december  at december   the fair value of our investment portfolio  excluding cash and cash equivalents  was billion 
our market risk to the investment portfolio is primarily interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
our exposure to equity price risk is related to our investments in relatively small positions of preferred stocks and mutual funds with an emphasis on dividend income 
these investments comprise of our investment portfolio 
our investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
we continue to increase our holdings of tax exempt securities based on our desire to maximize after tax investment income 
for our investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  we do not anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in our sensitivity model  we use a hypothetical change to measure our potential loss in fair value of debt securities assuming an upward and downward parallel shift in interest rates 
the table below presents our model s estimate of changes in fair values given a change in interest rates 
dollar values are in thousands 
rates down bps rates unchanged rates up bps fair value yield to maturity or call effective duration the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material change in fair values 
our debentures are subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on these debentures is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december  and  we had debentures of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  our term loan is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on our term loan is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had an outstanding under our term loan of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  at december   we had an outstanding under our term loan of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  we have entered into interest rate swap transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on our existing debt obligations 
these interest rate swap transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed highly effective hedges 
these interest rate swap transactions are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of the changes in fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income 
the interest differential to be paid or received is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
refer to note derivative instruments for further detail relating to our interest rate swap transactions

in addition  our revolving line of credit under which we can borrow up to million is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on the revolving line of credit is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had million outstanding under our line of credit 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  at december   we had million outstanding on this revolving line of credit 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would have changed interest expense by  in addition  at december  and  million in letters of credit had been issued
