item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview the company was organized on august  we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new drugs to treat hormonal and reproductive system disorders 
our primary product candidate  androxal  is a single isomer of clomiphene citrate and is an orally active proprietary small molecule compound 
we are developing androxal for men of reproductive age with low testosterone levels 
androxal treats the underlying mechanism that causes secondary hypogonadism and restores normal testicular function 
we have completed a phase b study of androxal in men with secondary hypogonadism  but na ve to testosterone treatment  at the fda s recommendation 
we have since announced top line results of this study that androxal was generally well tolerated compared to placebo and there were no drug related serious adverse events that led to discontinuation 
we met with the fda in may to discuss the design of pivotal phase efficacy studies for androxal as well as the components of the overall drug development program required for a new drug application nda submission 
during this meeting  we agreed upon registration requirements for androxal oral therapy for the treatment of secondary hypogonadism 
on july   we announced that we reached an agreement with the fda for the design of the pivotal efficacy studies for androxal for the treatment of secondary hypogonadism 
the pivotal studies are being conducted under a special protocol assessment spa 
depending on study enrollment and the completion of other studies  we believe we may be able to submit an nda by mid proellex  our product candidate for female reproductive health  is a new chemical entity that acts as a selective blocker of the progesterone receptor and is being developed for the treatment of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids and endometriosis 
we have conducted numerous studies with proellex dosing approximately women with the drug 
up until the summer of  all side effects exhibited in the studies were considered manageable and the benefit of proellex far outweighed the risk 
however  in phase efficacy and larger phase safety studies in diverse populations  a small number of subjects exhibited serious adverse effects associated with elevated liver enzymes 
as a result of these findings  we elected to stop the trials and the fda subsequently placed proellex on full clinical hold 
all women that experienced elevated liver enzymes and returned for follow up visits returned to baseline conditions with no overnight hospitalization necessary 
an analysis of all the subjects that experienced such serious adverse effects showed that the effect only occurred in a small percentage of subjects that were exposed to the mg dose of the drug for any period of time 
based on these findings  the company petitioned the fda to allow it to conduct a low dose study to demonstrate both safety and signals of efficacy in low oral doses of proellex  up to mg administered per day 
we completed the low dose escalating study in late and the results demonstrated no evidence of elevations of liver enzymes over baseline  suggesting these lower doses avoid the type of adverse events seen at much higher doses in earlier studies 
on october   we announced that the fda has agreed to a reclassification of the full clinical hold to a partial clinical hold on low dose oral proellex to allow us to conduct a phase study in the treatment of endometriosis 
we initiated this study in november and we believe full enrollment will be achieved in the second quarter of the fda has accepted an investigational new drug application ind for vaginally delivered proellex and  as a result  we commenced a phase vaginal administration study for uterine fibroids in the first quarter of and reported the final study results in january we have requested  and were granted  an end of phase meeting with the fda  scheduled for the last half of may  to discuss a phase study design for the vaginally delivered proellex for the treatment of uterine fribroids 
additionally  we have begun enrolling subjects who completed the phase study into a one year open label safety trial in order to begin collecting long term safety data which we expect the fda to require in connection with the submission of an nda 
we continue limited out licensing efforts for our phentolamine based product candidates  including vasomax  which had previously been approved for marketing in several countries in latin america for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction under the brand name z max 
vasomax has been on partial clinical hold in the us since  and no further development activities are planned 
the clinical development of pharmaceutical products is a complex undertaking and many products that begin the clinical development process do not obtain regulatory approval 
the costs associated with our clinical trials may be impacted by a number of internal and external factors  including the number and complexity of clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval  the number of eligible patients necessary to complete our clinical trials and any difficulty in enrolling these patients and the length of time to complete our clinical trials 
given the uncertainty of these potential costs  we recognize that the total costs we will incur for the clinical development of our product candidates may exceed our current estimates 
as with most biotechnology companies with drug candidates in development  the path to marketing approval by the fda and comparable foreign agencies for each such candidate is long and uncertain 
the regulatory process  both domestically and abroad  is a multi year process with no certainty when and if a drug candidate will be approved for commercial use 
the development path for a particular drug candidate typically includes a variety of clinical trials 
while we have a general estimate of the timeframe for our clinical trials  the actual anticipated completion dates for each of our drug candidates are uncertain due to a wide variety of risks  including those described in the risk factors in this annual report on form k 
the length of time for a clinical trial may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
a clinical hold can also result in unpredictable delays and added costs 
we will not receive any revenue from commercial sales unless we  or a potential partner  complete the clinical trial process  obtain regulatory approval  and successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
similarly  we do not have a reasonable basis to predict when or if material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our drug candidates will occur 
to date  we have not commercialized any of our drug candidates to any material extent and in fact may never do so 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and costs of completing the development of the company s drug candidates  see the section titled risk factors 
our results of operations may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  our ability to be successful in our clinical trials  the regulatory approval process in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions and the ability to complete new licenses and product development agreements 
the timing of our revenues may not match the timing of our associated product development expenses 
to date  research and development expenses have generally exceeded revenue in any particular period and or fiscal year 
as of december   we had accumulated losses of million  approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  and our accounts payable and accrued expenses were approximately million 
on february   we completed a registered direct offering to certain institutional investors  including certain existing shareholders  of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
net proceeds to us  after deducting the placement agent fees and offering expenses  were approximately million 
on september   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
net proceeds to us  after deducting offering expenses  were approximately million 
we anticipate that our current liquidity will be sufficient to continue these planned studies into the first quarter of  however  significant additional capital will be required for us to complete the development of our product candidates through nda approval 
we continue to explore potential additional financing alternatives including corporate partnering opportunities that would provide sufficient funds to enable us to continue to develop our two product candidates through nda approval  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any such additional funds on a timely basis or at all 
the foregoing matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december   we had full time employees who utilize the services of contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and various consultants to assist us in performing clinical and regulatory services for the clinical development of our products 
we are substantially dependent on our various contract groups to adequately perform the activities required to obtain regulatory approval of our products 
the value of the tax asset associated with the december  accumulated deficit can be substantially diminished in value to us due to various tax regulations  including change in control provisions in the tax code 
for additional information relating to our net operating loss carryforward  see note federal income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in conducting clinical trials for our product candidates  in research and development activities related to efforts to develop our products and from the associated administrative costs required to support those efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the transition from a development stage company to the successful introduction of commercially viable products 
our ability to achieve profitability will depend on  among other things  successfully completing the clinical development of our products in a reasonable time frame and at a reasonable cost  obtaining regulatory approvals  establishing marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities or collaborative arrangements with others that possess such capabilities  our and our partners ability to realize value from our research and development programs through the commercialization of those products and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability or that profitability  if achieved  can be sustained 
see item business risk factors and note organization and operations of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
please see note  summary of significant accounting policies  for a detailed discussion of our critical accounting policies 
a brief summary of our accounting policies is provided below 
capitalized patent costs the company capitalizes the cost associated with building its patent library for its androxal and proellex products 
as of december  and  other assets consist of capitalized patent costs in the amount of million and million  respectively 
patent costs  which include legal and application costs related to the patent portfolio  are being amortized over the lesser of years or the estimated economic life of the patent 
amortization of patent cost expense was   and  in  and  respectively 
of the million in capitalized patent costs at december    related to androxal and  related to proellex patents 
we review capitalized patent and patent application costs for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the patent are less than its carrying amount 
the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the patent cost as compared to its estimated fair value 
should the company not continue development of either drug candidate or should the company not continue as a going concern  the remaining capitalized patent costs may not be recoverable  which would result in charges to operating results in future periods 
accrued expenses we estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements 
examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for clinical trials  preclinical development and manufacturing of clinical materials 
we accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials or services provided and the invoices received from our external service providers 
in the case of clinical trials  a portion of the estimated cost normally relates to the projected cost to treat a patient in our trials  and we recognize this cost over the estimated term of the study based on the number of patients enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis  beginning with patient enrollment 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
however  subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals  which could also materially affect our balance sheet and results of operations 
research development expenses research and development r d expenses include salaries and related employee expenses  contracted regulatory affairs activities  insurance coverage for clinical trials and prior product sales  contracted research and consulting fees  facility costs and internal research and development supplies 
we expense research and development costs in the period they are incurred 
these costs consist of direct and indirect costs associated with specific projects as well as fees paid to various entities that perform research on our behalf 
share based compensation we had one stock based compensation plan at december   the equity incentive plan 
accounting standards generally require the recognition of the cost of employee services for share based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
expected volatility is determined using historical volatilities based on historical stock prices for a period equal to the expected term 
the expected volatility assumption is adjusted if future volatility is expected to vary from historical experience 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and falls between the options vesting and contractual expiration dates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a zero coupon us treasury bond whose maturity period equals the option s expected term 
income taxes we have had net operating losses since inception and  therefore  have not been subject to federal income taxes 
we have accumulated approximately million of research and development tax credits 
as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
additionally  approximately million of nols  and approximately  of research and development tax credits  expired in accounting standards require the recognition of a deferred tax asset 
however  a valuation allowance must be recorded for deferred tax assets whose recovery is deemed unlikely 
as we have incurred net operating losses since inception  and there is no certainty of future revenues  our deferred tax assets have been reserved in full in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additionally  if the company has an opportunity to use this nol to off set tax liabilities in the future  the use of this asset would be restricted based on internal revenue service  state and local nol use guidelines 
the company s public offerings completed on february   october   september   october   february   february   the sale and issuance of the atm shares  the issuance of unregistered shares as part of the settlement agreements we entered into with certain of our creditors since october of and the private placement of shares completed on september   may have created a change of ownership for federal income tax purposes 
the company has not completed a study to determine if this has occurred 
a change in ownership for federal income tax purposes may result in a limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in future periods 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues and other income total revenues and other income increased to  in as compared to  for this increase was primarily due to an increase of  in interest income due to higher cash balances 
research and development expenses r d expenses include contracted services relating to our clinical product development activities which include preclinical studies  clinical trials  regulatory affairs and bulk manufacturing scale up activities and bulk active ingredient purchases for preclinical and clinical trials primarily relating to our two products in clinical development  androxal and proellex 
research and development expenses also include internal operating expenses relating to our general research and development activities

clinical development expenses related to proellex increased due to the phase vaginal administration study for uterine fibroids conducted in to date through december  we have incurred approximately million for the development of androxal and approximately million for the development of proellex 
these accumulated costs exclude any internal operating expenses 
payroll and benefits r d payroll and benefits expense for both and  includes salaries  non cash stock based compensation expense and fringe benefits and increased or approximately  to million for the year ended as compared to million in this increase is primarily due to an increase in headcount 
included in payroll and benefit expense is a charge for non cash stock based compensation expense of  for the year ended as compared to  in the year ended operating and occupancy r d operating and occupancy decreased or approximately  to approximately  for the year ended as compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with our patent portfolio of approximately  and a reduction of  related to our product liability insurance premium  partially offset by an increase in consulting and other outside services of approximately  and an increase in amortization expense of  for the year ended as compared to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses g a increased or approximately million to million for as compared to million in our primary g a expenses for and are shown in the following table in thousands general and administrative december  december  variance change payroll and benefits   operating and occupancy   total    g a payroll and benefits expense for both and  includes salaries  non cash stock based compensation expense and fringe benefits and increased or approximately  to million for the year ended as compared to million in included in payroll and benefit expense is a charge for non cash stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended as compared to million in the year additionally  salaries for the year ended were million as compared to  for the increase in salaries of approximately  is primarily due to an increase in headcount and the discontinuation of the salary reduction program put in place in august g a operating and occupancy expense  which includes expenses to operate as a public company  increased or approximately  to million in as compared to million in the increase is primarily due to an increase in professional services 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues and other income total revenues and other income decreased to  in as compared to  for this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of  in other income 
in  the company recognized  in other income related to grant revenue received from the department of the treasury for investment in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section d of the internal revenue code 
additionally  we recognized approximately  in non cash other income from settlements with certain vendors in research and development expenses r d expenses include contracted services relating to our clinical product development activities which include preclinical studies  clinical trials  regulatory affairs and bulk manufacturing scale up activities and bulk active ingredient purchases for preclinical and clinical trials primarily relating to our two products in clinical development  which are androxal and proellex

clinical development expenses for proellex decreased for the year ended as compared to due to the completion of the dose escalating study allowed by the fda to demonstrate both safety and signals of efficacy in low oral doses of the drug 
through december  we have incurred approximately million for the development of androxal and approximately million for the development of proellex 
these accumulated costs exclude any internal operating expenses 
payroll and benefits r d payroll and benefits expense for both and  includes salaries  non cash stock based compensation expense and fringe benefits and increased or approximately  to million for the year ended as compared to  in this increase is primarily due to an increase in headcount and the discontinuation of the salary reduction program put in place in august included in payroll and benefit expense is a charge for non cash stock based compensation expense of  for the year ended as compared to  in the year operating and occupancy r d operating and occupancy increased or approximately  to approximately million for the year ended as compared to  in this increase is primarily due to an increase in costs related to our patent portfolio of approximately  and an increase in travel expenses of approximately  for the year ended as compared to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses g a increased or approximately million to million for as compared to million in our primary g a expenses for and are shown in the following table in thousands general and administrative december  december  variance change payroll and benefits   operating and occupancy   total    g a payroll and benefits expense for both and  includes salaries  non cash stock based compensation expense and fringe benefits and increased or approximately million to million for the year ended as compared to  in included in payroll and benefit expense is a charge for non cash stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended as compared to  in the year stock based compensation for includes a charge of  in june associated with  stock option awards issued under the equity incentive plan approved by the stockholders of the company on june  which vested immediately upon stockholders approval

podolski s salary was revised to a reduction on january  g a operating and occupancy expense  which includes expenses to operate as a public company  decreased or approximately  to million in as compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in professional services 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements except the operating lease relating to our facility 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from private placements and public offerings of equity securities and with funds received under collaborative agreements 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations since inception 
we will require substantial funds for research and development  including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  and to commence sales and marketing efforts  if appropriate  if the fda or other regulatory approvals are obtained 
based on our existing and projected accounts payable and commitments  we believe we will need to raise additional capital by the first quarter of in order to continue operations on a normal basis 
if our expenses are greater than expected or our revenues are less than expected  we may be required to raise additional funds prior to that time 
historically we have secured additional cash resources through the sale of our equity securities  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise sufficient capital in the future 
on february   we entered into an equity distribution agreement the equity distribution agreement with ladenburg thalmann co 
inc ladenburg  pursuant to which we may issue and sell from time to time through ladenburg  as sales agent and or principal  shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million the atm shares 
we have no obligation to sell any atm shares under the equity distribution agreement 
for the year ended december   we sold an aggregate of atm shares at a weighted average share price of  for proceeds of approximately  net of expenses 
cumulative through december   we have sold  atm shares at a weighted average share price of  for proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
as of the date of this filing  the registration statement on form s registering the sale of the atm shares to the public has lapsed and  as a result  no additional atm shares may be sold under the equity distribution agreement until a registration statement related to such shares is effective 
on february   we completed an underwritten public offering of  units including the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option  consisting of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  series a warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock and series b warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  at a price per unit of 
each unit consisted of four shares of our common stock  series a warrants exercisable for three shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share and series b warrants exercisable for shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
net proceeds to us  after the underwriting discount and offering expenses  were approximately million 
the fair value of the series a and series b warrants was determined using a black scholes model with the following assumptions risk free interest rate of  no dividend yield  volatility of and an expected term of six months 
this resulted in a fair value of the series a and series b warrants of approximately million  which has been recorded in additional paid in capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
as of december    shares of our common stock have been issued from the exercise of the series a warrants at per share and  shares of our common stock have been issued from the exercise of the series b warrants at per share 
the series a and b warrants have a five year term from the date of issuance 
the series b warrants are callable by the company in the event that the company s stock trades at or more for a period of trading days over any consecutive trading day period 
as of the date of this filing  our common stock has reached this price threshold  however  we have not yet required the exercise of the series b warrants pursuant to this provision 
the series a and b warrants are also exercisable on a cashless basis 
in addition  in no event may the warrants be exercised if the holder would own or more of the outstanding shares of the company s common stock following the exercise 
on february   we completed a registered direct offering to certain institutional investors  including certain existing shareholders  of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
net proceeds to us  after deducting the placement agent fees and offering expenses  were approximately million 
on september   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
net proceeds to us  after deducting offering expenses  were approximately million 
the private placement shares may be resold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s  as amended file no 

our primary use of cash to date has been in operating activities to fund research and development  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  and general and administrative expenses 
we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of december  as compared to million as of december  additionally  we had accounts payable and accrued expenses of million as of december  as compared to million as of december  net cash of approximately million  million and million was used in operating activities during  and  respectively 
the major use of cash for operating activities during was to fund our clinical development programs and associated administrative costs 
cash used in investing activities was   and  during  and  respectively 
the major use of cash for investing activities during was primarily for capitalized patent and patent application costs for androxal and proellex 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities during was primarily due to the registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of completed on february  and the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of completed on september  our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals of our products  the problems  delays  expenses and complications frequently encountered by development stage companies  the progress of our preclinical and clinical activities  the costs associated with any future collaborative research  manufacturing  marketing or other funding arrangements  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals  the success of our potential future sales and marketing programs  the cost of filing  prosecuting and defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in economic  regulatory or competitive conditions of our planned business  and additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
to satisfy our capital requirements  we are exploring ways to raise additional funds by the first quarter of there can be no assurance that any such funding will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
if we are successful in obtaining additional financing  we anticipate that such financing will result in significant dilution of the ownership interests of our current stockholders and may provide certain rights to the new investors senior to the rights of our current stockholders  including but not limited to voting rights and rights to proceeds in the event of a sale or liquidation of the company 
the uncertainties relating to the foregoing matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company leases laboratory and office space pursuant to leases accounted for as operating leases 
the lease for the company s laboratory and office space expires in june rental expense for the years ended december   and  was approximately   and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under non cancelable leases with original terms in excess of one year as of december   are as follows in thousands total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million as of december  which is primarily held in a money market mutual fund backed by us government securities 
although this cash account is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no significant gain or loss on this account is expected to be recognized in earnings 
we do not invest in derivative securities
