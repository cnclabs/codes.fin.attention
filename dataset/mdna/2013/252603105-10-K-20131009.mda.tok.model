we evaluate the performance of our segments based on net sales and gross profit for each of the segments 
diamond reports its operating results on the basis of a fiscal year that starts august and ends july diamond refers to the fiscal years ended july    and  as fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues 
table of contents and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer  price is fixed  delivery occurs and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of rebates  introductory or slotting payments  coupons  promotion and marketing allowances 
the amount we accrue for promotion is based on an estimate of the level of performance of the trade promotion  and is based upon factors such as historical trends with similar promotions  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and sales and payment trends with similar previously offered programs 
customers have the right to return certain products 
product returns are estimated based upon historical results and are reflected as a reduction in sales 
inventories 
all inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost first in  first out or weighted average or market basis 
we have entered into walnut purchase agreements with growers  under which they deliver their walnut crop to us during the fall harvest season  and pursuant to our walnut purchase agreements  we determine the price for this inventory after receipt and by the end of the fiscal year 
this purchase price is determined by us based on our discretion provided in the agreements  taking into account market conditions  crop size  quality and nut varieties  among other relevant factors 
since the ultimate purchase price to be paid will be determined subsequent to receiving the walnut crop  we estimate the final purchase price for our interim financial statements 
those interim estimates may subsequently change due to changes in the factors described above and the effect of the change could be significant 
any such changes in estimates are accounted for in the period of change by adjusting inventory on hand or cost of goods sold if the inventory is sold through 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets ranging from to years for buildings and ranging from to years for machinery  equipment and software 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  property  plant  and equipment 
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives of years 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  or more often if there are indications of possible impairment 
we perform our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests as of june th each year 
the analysis to determine whether or not an asset is impaired requires significant judgments that are dependent on internal forecasts  including estimated future cash flows  estimates of long term growth rates for our business  the expected life over which cash flows will be realized and assumed royalty and discount rates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and any impairment charge 
while the fair value of these assets exceeds their carrying value based on our current estimates and assumptions  materially different estimates and assumptions in the future in response to changing economic conditions  changes in our business or for other reasons could result in the recognition of impairment losses 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets and long lived assets subject to amortization  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
significant management judgment is required in this process 

table of contents for brand intangible assets not subject to amortization  we test for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing brand intangibles for impairment  we compare the fair value with the carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on the relief from royalty method  which models the cash flows from the brand intangibles assuming royalties were received under a licensing arrangement 
this discounted cash flow analysis  uses inputs such as forecasted future revenues attributable to the brand  assumed royalty rates and a risk adjusted discount rate that approximates our estimated cost of capital 
if we were to experience a decrease in forecasted future revenues attributable to the brands  this could indicate a potential impairment 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  the brand intangible asset is considered impaired  and an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the brand intangible asset 
we performed our annual intangible asset impairment analysis as of june  using discount rates ranging from to and determined that the kettle us trade name within the snacks segment was impaired based on a decrease in forecasted future revenues and earnings before interest and taxes ebit margin 
we recorded a million impairment charge within the asset impairments line on our consolidated statement of operations 
at june   the remaining brand intangible assets had a fair value that was approximately over their carrying value 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test required by asc as of june th of each year 
during fiscal  we adopted asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
for both fiscal and fiscal  we elected to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis rather than a qualitative analysis 
as a result of our segment reporting changes for the period ended january   goodwill impairment will now be tested at the reporting units  which are the same as our operating segments 
in fiscal  we performed our goodwill impairment test at our single reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated using a blend of the income and the market approach 
goodwill impairment is indicated if the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  in which case the goodwill is written down to its estimated fair value 
major assumptions applied in an income approach  using a discounted cash flow analysis  include i forecasted sales growth rates and ii forecasted profitability  both of which are estimated based on consideration of historical performance and management s estimate of future performance  and iii discount rates that are used to calculate the present value of future cash flows  which rates are derived based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
the major assumptions in the market approach include the selected multiples applied to certain operating statistics  such as revenues and income  as well as an estimated control premium 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and business initiatives in order to estimate future growth rates and profitability which is used to estimate future cash flows and multiples 
for example  a significant change in promotional strategy or a shortfall in contracted walnut supply could have a direct impact on revenue growth and operating costs  which could have a direct impact on the profitability of the reporting units 
future business results could significantly impact the evaluation of our goodwill which could have a material impact on the determination of whether a potential impairment existed  and the size of any such impairment 
at july   the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately million  compared to total assets of approximately  million and total shareholders equity of approximately million 
at july   the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately million  compared to total assets of approximately  million and total shareholders equity of approximately million 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of june  using discount rates ranging from to 
goodwill was determined not to be impaired and the fair values of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values except for the emerald reporting unit 
the emerald fair value exceeded the carrying value by a margin of less than due to a decrease in forecasted future revenues and margins 
this reporting unit represents approximately of our goodwill balance as of july  while the emerald reporting unit passed the first step of the impairment test as of june   if our revenue growth projections or the discount rate were to change in the future  it could adversely affect the estimated fair value 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant at the testing date  a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used in the testing of this reporting unit could reduce the fair value below its carrying value  indicating a possible impairment 

table of contents we cannot guarantee that we will not record a material impairment charge in the future 
changes in our results  assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit and  therefore  could reduce the excess of fair value over the carrying value of a reporting unit entirely and could result in goodwill impairment 
events and conditions that could indicate impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common stock  increased competition or loss of market share  lack of product innovation or obsolescence  or product claims that result in a significant loss of sales or profitability over a period of time 
for example  an expected decline in long term forecasted cash flow projections  such as net sales for a reporting unit  could indicate a fair value which is lower than carrying value 
to the extent calculated fair values decline to a level lower than reporting unit carrying values  or if other indicators of potential impairment are present  we will be required to take further steps to determine if an impairment of goodwill has occurred and to calculate an impairment loss 
employee benefits 
we incur various employment related benefit costs with respect to qualified and nonqualified pension and deferred compensation plans 
assumptions are made related to discount rates used to value certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets in the plans  compensation increases  employee turnover and mortality rates 
different assumptions could result in the recognition of differing amounts of expense over different periods of time 
derivative financial instruments 
we account for the warrant issued as part of the oaktree transaction as a freestanding derivative financial instrument 
we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet at the point the transaction is entered into and at the end of all subsequent reporting periods 
on a quarterly basis  changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument are recorded in current period earnings 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes this guidance requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities at current tax rates 
this guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on both our historical and anticipated earnings levels and is reviewed periodically to determine if any additional valuation allowance is necessary when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  and adjust them accordingly 
differences between management s position and taxing authorities on issues could result in an increase or decrease to tax expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation arrangements  including stock option grants and restricted stock awards  in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
under this guidance  compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant 
the compensation cost is then amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant 
this model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term  volatility and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value 
these key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal on august   we reached a proposed agreement  preliminary approval of which was granted on september   subject to final court approval  to settle the private securities class action that is pending against us and two of our former officers 
a final approval hearing is currently scheduled for january  under the terms of the preliminarily approved settlement  we would pay a total of million in cash and issue million shares of common stock to a settlement fund to resolve all claims asserted on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired diamond stock between october  and february   inclusive 
a portion of the million in cash would be funded by our insurers 
we recognized an aggregate settlement liability of million in the fourth fiscal quarter which included a cash settlement of million and a stock settlement valued at million at the close of the stock market on august  based on our closing market price on the day before the preliminary approval motion 
the value of the million shares of common stock at july  was million 
until the settlement shares are distributed  the liability associated with the agreement to issue the settlement shares will be adjusted from period to period based on changes in our stock price  with the effect of the change included in our statement of operations 
net sales were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to decreased nuts sales partially offset by an increase in snacks sales 
sales incentives primarily promotional allowances  coupons and slotting as a percentage of gross sales decreased approximately year over year

the impact of foreign exchange on our net sales was not significant for fiscal net sales by segment in thousands year ended july  change from to net sales snacks nuts total gross profit snacks nuts total snacks segment net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily driven by an increase in net price realization 
nuts segment net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily driven by decreases in volume of  partially offset by an increase in net price realization 
the decline in volume was primarily driven by lower walnut supply  planned reductions in sku s  and promotional sales 
gross profit 
snacks segment gross profit as a percentage of snack net sales was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the snacks segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects an increase in net price realization and a reduction in unit processing costs based on cost reduction initiatives 
nuts segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in nuts segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal reflects a focus on increasing net price realization  rationalization of lower performing sku s  and our cost savings initiatives  offset in part by an increase in certain commodity costs

please refer to liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory rate of  in these periods  is primarily due to the valuation allowance which was provided to reduce united states and state deferred tax assets to amounts considered recoverable and united states and state deferred taxes from diamond s long lived intangibles amortization 
these tax expense impacts were offset by the benefits of income generated in the united kingdom at lower tax rates and the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the united states 
our fiscal effective tax rate was also impacted by the write down of intangibles related to kettle 
our fiscal effective tax rate was also impacted by discrete tax benefits  and the conclusion of a tax ruling with the united kingdom tax authorities 
this resulted in a net tax benefit of million  attributable to the reversal of our unrecognized tax benefit related to this event 

table of contents during the three months ended april   we recorded a tax valuation allowance charge of million 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we regularly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets based on the likelihood that the benefits of the deferred tax assets would or would not ultimately be realized in future periods 
in making this assessment  significant weight was given to evidence that could be objectively verified such as recent operating results and less consideration was given to less objective indicators such as future earnings projections 
as a result of its most recent evaluation and after consideration of positive and negative evidence  including the recent history of losses in the current fiscal year  we evaluated our valuation allowance for fiscal and increased the valuation allowance to million as of july  fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased snack sales and increased culinary and retail in shell sales 
sales incentives primarily promotional allowances  coupons and slotting as a percentage of gross sales increased approximately year over year

additionally  the number of contracted walnut growers and delivered pounds decreased in fiscal  reducing available walnut supply and contributing to the decrease in the nuts segment 
gross profit 
snacks segment gross profit as a percentage of snack net sales was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the slight decrease in the snacks segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to additional depreciation associated with our plant expansion in salem  oregon and our beloit  wisconsin plant that was completed at the end of fiscal  and lower price realization 
nuts segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to a substantial decline in walnut crop deliveries and higher commodity costs  particularly for walnuts  partially offset by price increases taken in response to those rising costs

income taxes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to not benefiting tax losses by establishing a valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred assets taxes in the three months ended april  in the third fiscal quarter  as a result of cumulative losses  we concluded that a valuation allowance was required on certain us and state deferred tax assets principally net operating losses nol s and california ez credits as it was management s assessment that it was no longer more likely than not that those assets could be realized

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is dependent upon funds generated from operations and external sources of financing 
cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal the change from cash used in operating activities to cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in inventory largely resulting from a lower walnut supply  and an increase in accounts payables and accrued liabilities as result of the settlement of the private securities class action 
additionally  non cash reconciling items such as an increase in payment in kind interest increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal compared to cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal the lower cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the completion of our beloit  wisconsin plant expansion at the end of fiscal cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal compared to million cash provided by financing activities during fiscal the change from cash provided by financing activities to cash used in financing activities was primarily due to increased borrowings from the oaktree investment in fiscal and payment of long term debt obligations and notes payables in fiscal cash used in operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million of cash provided by operating activities during fiscal the change from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in operating activities was primarily due to significant expenditures related to acquisition  integration  and investigation related activities and higher walnut costing 
cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the lower cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the completion of our beloit  wisconsin plant expansion  which was partially funded by the restricted cash received in fiscal we expect lower capital expenditures during fiscal compared to previous fiscal years due to our efforts to reduce costs 
cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal compared to million cash used in financing activities during fiscal the change from cash used in financing activities to cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increased borrowings from the oaktree investment  which is described below 
at july   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents 
of this balance  million was held in the united kingdom in foreign currencies 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings at these locations in order to ensure sufficient working capital and expand operations 
applicable us income taxes have not been provided on approximately million of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at july   because these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested 
the net federal income tax liability that would arise if these earnings were not indefinitely reinvested is approximately million 
applicable us income taxes are provided on these earnings in the periods in which they are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested 
in the event that management elects for any reason in the future to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states  we would incur additional tax expense upon such repatriation 
in february  we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of lenders for a five year million secured credit facility the secured credit facility 
we used the borrowings under the secured credit facility to fund a portion of the kettle foods acquisition and to fund ongoing operations 
our secured credit facility 
table of contents initially consisted of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
in march  the syndicate of lenders approved our request for a million increase in our revolving credit facility to million  under the same terms 
in august  the syndicate of lenders approved our request for a million increase in our revolving credit facility to million  under the same terms 
the revolving credit facility was reduced from million to million as part of the third amendment 
as of july   the revolving credit facility had million in capacity  of which million was outstanding 
the capacity under the revolving credit facility will decrease to million effective january  in may  we made a million pre payment on the term loan facility as part of the third amendment 
as of july   the term loan facility had million in capacity  of which million was outstanding 
in addition  scheduled principal payments on the term loan facility were million due quarterly  with the remaining principal balance and any outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility to be repaid on may  substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets are considered collateral security under the secured credit facility 
the secured credit facility provides for customary affirmative and negative covenants and cross default provisions that may be triggered  if we fail to comply with obligations under our other credit facilities or indebtedness 
beginning on october   our senior debt to consolidated ebitda ratio consolidated senior leverage ratio  as defined in the third amendment  will be limited to no more than to and our fixed charge coverage ratio to no less than to 
the consolidated senior leverage ratio covenant will decline each quarter  ultimately to to in the quarter ending july  in december  kettle foods obtained  and we guaranteed  a year fixed rate loan the guaranteed loan in the principal amount of million  of which million was outstanding as of july  principal and interest payments are due monthly throughout the term of the loan 
the guaranteed loan was being used to purchase equipment for our beloit  wisconsin plant expansion 
borrowed funds were placed in an interest bearing escrow account and were made available as expenditures were approved for reimbursement 
as the cash was used to purchase non current assets  such restricted cash was classified as non current on the balance sheet 
in december  the remaining balance within the escrow account was released back to the lender and was used to pay down the outstanding loan balance 
also  as part of the paydown  we paid a prepayment penalty  which was recorded in interest expense 
the guaranteed loan provides for customary affirmative and negative covenants  which are similar to the covenants under the secured credit facility 
the financial covenants within the guaranteed loan were reset to match those in the third amendment 
in march  we reached an agreement with our lenders to forbear from seeking any remedies under the secured credit facility with respect to specified existing and anticipated non compliance with the credit agreement and to amend our credit agreement second amendment 
under the amended credit agreement  we had continued access to our existing revolving credit facility through a forbearance period initially through june  subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the amended credit agreement 
during the forbearance period  the interest rate on borrowings increased 
the credit agreement required us to suspend dividend payments to stockholders 
in addition  we paid a forbearance fee of basis points to our lenders 
the forbearance period concluded on may   when we closed agreements to recapitalize our balance sheet with an investment by oaktree capital management  lp oaktree 
the oaktree investment initially consists of million of newly issued senior notes and a warrant to purchase approximately million shares of diamond common stock 
the senior notes will mature in and bear interest at per year that may be paid in kind at our option for the first two years 
oaktree s warrant became exercisable at per share starting on march  the oaktree agreements provided that if we secured a specified minimum supply of walnuts from the crop and achieved profitability targets for its nut businesses for the six month period ended january   the warrant would be cancelled and oaktree would have had the ability to exchange million of the senior notes for convertible preferred stock of our company the special redemption 
the convertible preferred stock 
table of contents would have had an initial conversion price of  which represented a discount to the closing price of our common stock on april   the date that we entered into its commitment with oaktree 
the convertible preferred stock would have paid a dividend that would be paid in kind for the first two years 
the warrant is accounted for as a derivative liability with gains or losses included in gain loss on warrant liability in our statements of operations 
based on our operating results for the six months ended january   the special redemption did not occur 
pursuant to the oaktree agreements  diamond was permitted to prepay all but not part of the principal on the oaktree notes at a premium prior to may  beginning on may   the applicable premium increased to and would be applied to any prepayments of principal including partial prepayments 
this premium will reduce to on may   on may   and nil on may  the oaktree agreements do not impose any covenants incremental to those under the secured credit facility 
on may   we entered into the waiver and third amendment to its secured credit facility third amendment  which provided for a lower level of total bank debt  initially at million  along with substantial covenant relief until october  at that time  these covenants will become applicable at revised levels set forth in the third amendment initially to for the consolidated senior leverage ratio  declining each quarter ultimately to to in the quarter ending july  and thereafter  and to for the fixed charge coverage ratio 
the third amendment included a new covenant requiring that we have at least million of cash  cash equivalents and revolving credit availability at all times beginning february  in addition  the third amendment required a million pre payment of the term loan facility  while reducing the remaining scheduled principal payments on the term loan facility from million to million 
the third amendment also amends the definition of applicable rate under the secured credit agreement which sets the margin over libor and the base rate at which loans under the secured credit agreement bear interest 
initially  eurodollar rate loans bore interest at plus the libor for the applicable loan period  and base rate loans bore interest at basis points plus the highest of i the federal funds rate plus basis points  ii the prime rate  or iii eurodollar rate plus basis points

the applicable rate will decline  if and when we achieve specified reductions in our consolidated senior leverage ratio  as defined in the third amendment

the secured credit facility and the securities purchase agreement  dated as of may   by and between diamond and ocm pf ff adamantine holdings  ltd 
the oaktree spa provide for customary affirmative and negative covenants  and cross default provisions that may be triggered if we fail to comply with obligations under our other credit facilities or indebtedness 
the secured credit facility and the oaktree spa included a covenant that restricts the amount of other indebtedness including capital leases and purchase money obligations for fixed or capital assets  to no more than million 
the accounting treatment for the seven year equipment lease for our salem  oregon plant the kettle us lease and the five year equipment lease for our norfolk  united kingdom plant the kettle uk lease caused us to be in default of the covenants limiting other indebtedness 
these defaults were waived  with respect to the kettle uk lease on july  fourth amendment  and with respect to the kettle us lease on august  fifth amendment 
additionally  the secured credit facility and the oaktree spa were each amended to allow diamond to incur up to million of capital leases and purchase money obligations for fixed or capital assets  which amount will be reduced from and after december  a to million under the secured credit facility and b to million under the oaktree spa 
as of july   the company was compliant with financial and reporting covenants as provided by the secured credit facility 
working capital and stockholders equity were million and million at july   compared to million and million at july  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to an increase in liabilities associated with the private securities class action settlement  increase in the warrant liability related to the oaktree debt  and utilization of excess inventories

effects of inflation the most significant inflationary factor affecting our net sales and cost of sales is the change in market prices for purchased nuts  corn  potatoes  oils and other ingredients 
the prices of these commodities are affected by us and world market conditions and are volatile in response to supply and demand  as well as political and economic events 
the price fluctuations of these commodities do not necessarily correlate with the general inflation rate 
inflation is likely to however  adversely affect operating costs such as labor  energy and materials

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices  interest rates on borrowings and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodities risk 
the availability  size  quality  and cost of raw materials for the production of our products  including walnuts  pecans  peanuts  cashews  almonds  other nuts  corn  potatoes and oils are subject to risks inherent to farming  such as crop size and yield fluctuations caused by poor weather and growing conditions  pest and disease problems  and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  our supply of raw materials could be reduced if governmental agencies conclude that our products have been tampered with  or that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
interest rate risk 
we have established a formal investment policy to help minimize the exposure to our cash equivalents for changes in interest rates  which are primarily affected by credit quality and the type of cash equivalents we hold 
these guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal 
our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
with such a short maturity  our portfolio s market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
the sensitivity of our cash and cash equivalent portfolio as of july  to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not be significant 
interest rate volatility could also materially affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  as well as the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver 
the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver are dependent on libor 
we believe a basis point increase or decrease on our variable interest rates would not be significant 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we have operations outside the us with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily in the united kingdom 
because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
the foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of july  are not expected to result in a significant impact on future earnings or cash flows 
however  in july  we entered into a series of foreign exchange collars to hedge a portion of our expected canadian dollar denominated receivables of kettle foods between september and january  which were subsequently extended through july in september  we entered into a series of foreign exchange participating forwards to hedge a portion of our expected canadian dollar denominated receivables of emerald between november and august our sales of finished goods and purchases of raw materials and supplies from outside the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
thus  certain revenues and expenses have been  and are expected to be  subject to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  and these fluctuations may have an impact on operating results
