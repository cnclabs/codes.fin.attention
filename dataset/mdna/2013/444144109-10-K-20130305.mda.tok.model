there can be no assurance that the company proposed or future plans will be successful  and as such  the company may require additional capital sooner than anticipated  which capital may not be available 
inflation inflation has not historically had a material impact on the company operations 
reliance on suppliers and customers the company financial performance and its ability to sell refrigerants is in part dependent on its ability to obtain sufficient quantities of virgin  non cfc based refrigerants  and of reclaimable cfc and non cfc based refrigerants from manufacturers  wholesalers  distributors  bulk gas brokers and from other sources within the air conditioning  refrigeration and automotive aftermarket industries  and on corresponding demand for refrigerants 
the company refrigerant sales include cfc based refrigerants  which are no longer manufactured 
additionally  the company refrigerant sales include non cfc based refrigerants  including hcfc and hfc refrigerants  which are the most widely used refrigerants 
effective january   the act limits the production of virgin hcfc refrigerants  which production was further limited in january federal regulations enacted in january established production and consumption allowances for hcfcs and imposed limitations on the importation of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants 
in addition  effective january  the act further limited the production of virgin hcfc refrigerants and additional federal regulations were enacted which imposed further limitations and a phase down on the use  production and importation of certain virgin hcfc refrigerants 
as a result of certain litigation  the federal regulations implementing the january phase down schedule have been vacated and in july the epa recast production and consumption allowances for the year 
in january  the epa published a proposed rule by which the epa has proposed to further reduce the production of hcfc refrigerants when compared to the reductions established in the january  published rule 
the reductions proposed by the epa in the proposed rule range from to percent from the levels established in the prior rule  for calendar years   and the period 
to the extent that there is no final rule for the period  the industry is operating under the direction of no action assurance letters issued by the enforcement division of the epa 
for the years ending december  and  the epa has allowed virgin production or importation of and million pounds  respectively  of hcfc it is expected that for the year the epa will allow for the production and importation of at least million pounds 
once a final rule is released the actual production figures will be known for the entire period 
the limitations imposed by and under the act may limit supplies of virgin refrigerants for the foreseeable future or cause a significant increase in the price of virgin hcfc refrigerants 
for the year ended december   two customers each accounted for or more of the company s revenues and  in the aggregate these two customers accounted for of the company s revenues 
at december   there were no outstanding receivables from these customers 
for the year ended december   no one customer accounted for or more of the company s revenues 
the loss of a principal customer or a decline in the economic prospects of and or a reduction in purchases of the company products or services by any such customer could have a material adverse effect on the company financial position and results of operations 
seasonality and weather conditions and fluctuations in operating results the company operating results vary from period to period as a result of weather conditions  requirements of potential customers  non recurring refrigerant and service sales  availability and price of refrigerant products virgin or reclaimable  changes in reclamation technology and regulations  timing in introduction and or retrofit or replacement of cfc and non cfc based refrigeration equipment  the rate of expansion of the company operations  and by other factors 
the company business is seasonal in nature with peak sales of refrigerants occurring in the first half of each year 
during past years  the seasonal decrease in sales of refrigerants has resulted in losses particularly in the fourth quarter of the year 
in addition  to the extent that there is unseasonably cool weather throughout the spring and summer months  which would adversely affect the demand for refrigerants  there would be a corresponding negative impact on the company 
delays or inability in securing adequate supplies of refrigerants at peak demand periods  lack of refrigerant demand  increased expenses  declining refrigerant prices and a loss of a principal customer could result in significant losses 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not occur and result in a material adverse effect on the company financial position and significant losses 
the company believes that there is a similar seasonal element to refrigerantside service revenues as refrigerant sales 
the company is continuing to assess its refrigerantside service revenues seasonal trend 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill or other topic testing indefinite living tangible assets for impairment 
asu simplifies the guidance for testing the decline in the realizable value impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill by allowing an organization the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
an organization electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the organization determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in october  the fasb issued asu  technical corrections and improvements 
asu contains amendments to clarify the asc  correct unintended application of guidance  or make minor improvements to the asc that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities 
additionally  the amendments are intended to make the asc easier to understand and the fair valve measurement guidance easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing needed clarifications 
the amendments that do not have transition guidance were effective upon issuance 
the amendments that are subject to the transition guidance will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position
