item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
management overview fiscal year highlights we released updated versions of all major software products 
we advanced the development of our new membraneplus software program for simulation of in vitro permeability experiment  which is now nearing completion 
we completed two funded collaboration agreements with top pharmaceutical companies to extend the capabilities of our flagship gastroplus software with an enhanced oral cavity absorption model and the ability to simulate dosing through the skin 
we successfully completed the second year of our five year renewable collaboration with the center for food safety and nutrition of the fda to develop predictive toxicity models for food additives and contaminants 
we initiated a new drug design project targeting cox and cox enzymes and sent out requests for quotations for synthesis of these new molecules 
after this reporting period we selected a contractor and development of the synthetic methods is now under way 
we expanded our technical staff  adding new phd scientists to the life sciences department and two additional engineers to form a new computational technologies ct team 
hosted multi day workshops in the united states and europe to educate users on the various features applications of our software redesigned website with modern look and new interactive features attended scientific conferences  presenting posters and oral podium lectures achieved renewal rate for software licenses over last fiscal quarters signed new clients includes new organizations and departments at existing clients finalized new orders for software licenses at several major regulatory agencies including the us fda  us epa  and china sfda achieved increase in license revenue from asian territories japan  china  korea  singapore  and thailand 
assisted with the formation of the gastroplus user group  an interactive network of north american and european industry users that has created a forum for sharing best practices  addressing unmet needs  and promoting the adoption of modeling simulation 
in december during our first fiscal quarter of fy  the board of directors decided to pay an accelerated cash dividend consisting of all of the per share dividend planned for february  plus of the planned dividends for may  august  and december this was done to provide shareholders with the benefit of the lower income tax rates in compared to the increased rates for our board of directors declared increased from quarterly cash dividends of per share in may and august 
recently  our board of directors declared a share dividend for november  distribution  which is in fiscal year our cash position remained strong  with cash at the end of the fiscal year of million  and we have no debt 
fiscal year financial summary gross revenues increased to  from  in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  from  in fiscal year research and development expenditures increased to  from  in fiscal year in fiscal year  approximately  was spent for outside services to synthesize and test the new molecules we designed to inhibit the growth of the malaria parasite 
in fiscal year  we did not have such an expense  resulting appearance of small increase in research and development expenditure income from continuing operations increased to  from  in fiscal year strategy going forward continue to advance our software offerings through both our in house developments and our funded and unfunded collaborations with our industry and government customers continue to seek acquisition and partnership possibilities to broaden our offerings of products and services continue our marketing and sales campaign including attending and exhibiting at numerous scientific conferences and meetings  expanded use of social media  and expanded advertising increase our marketing and sales efforts with respect to our consulting services in both pharmacokinetics and in small molecule design seek partners for our malaria new chemical initiative to take it further into development select a new target and repeat our drug design  synthesis  and test activities as we did for malaria to further demonstrate the capabilities of our admet design suite to generate high quality lead compounds in a fraction of the time and cost normally required fiscal year was another record year 
we believe the continued growth of our pharmaceutical software and services business segment is the result of steadily increasing adoption of simulation and modeling software tools across the pharmaceutical industry  as well as the expertise we offer as consultants to assist companies involved in the research and development of new medicines 
we have received a continuing series of study contracts with pharmaceutical companies ranging from several of the largest in the world to a number of medium sized and smaller companies in the us and europe 
our financial performance enabled us to maintain significant cash deposits  remain debt free  and continue to invest in our marketing and sales activities we began in early in order to reach a wider customer base  as well as to distribute significant cash dividends to our shareholders 
we have not been successful in identifying and completing any acquisitions during this reporting period in spite of ongoing investigations 
it is our intent to continue to search for acquisition opportunities that would be compatible with our current businesses and that would be immediately accretive  ie  adding to both revenues and earnings 
in the past  we have used some of our cash to repurchase shares of our common stock because we believe that reducing the number of fully diluted shares provides greater value to our shareholders than receiving a low interest rate on our cash deposits  and because we believe that our cash deposits after such repurchases remain sufficient to accomplish any reasonable potential acquisitions as well as to maintain sufficient cash reserves to ensure meeting operational needs for the foreseeable future 
although there are no stock repurchase programs pending  our board of directors may consider additional repurchases at any time at prices and under conditions set by our board of directors 
results of operations the following sets forth selected items from our statements of operations in thousands and the percentages that such items bear to net sales for the fiscal years ended august  fy and august  fy 
fiscal years ended net sales   cost of sales   gross profit   selling  general and administrative   research and development total operating expenses   income from operations   other income net income before taxes   provision for income taxes   income from continuing operations   results of discontinued operations  net of tax net income   fy compared with fy net sales net sales increased  or  to  in fy from  in fy we attribute the increase in pharmaceutical software sales to increases in the number of licenses with new and existing customers  as well as licensing of new modules to existing customers  especially for our gastroplus line of products because it has more modules than other products we offer 
the revenue from sales of software increased approximately  or 
in fy  the revenue from two funded collaborations which will expand the capabilities of our gastroplus software and analytical studies also increased approximately  or 
cost of sales cost of sales increased  or  to  in fy from  in fy as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased by 
a significant portion of cost of sales is the systematic amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is an independent fixed cost rather than a variable cost related to sales 
this amortization cost increased approximately  or  in fy compared with fy royalty expense  a variable cost related to sales of our gastroplus core program as well as royalties from the agreement with accelrys  inc the original agreement was with symyx technologies which merged with accelrys  inc metabolite metabolism  increased approximately  or  in fy compared with fy service cost  such as labor costs for trainings workshops  analytical studies  and technical support  increased approximately  or  in fy compared with fy due to more number of person hours allocated to those services during fy compared with fy gross profit gross profit increased  or  to  in fy from  in fy we attribute this increase to the increased sales of pharmaceutical software which outweighed an increase in the cost of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased  or to  in fy  compared to  in fy  however  as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to approximately in fy from approximately in fy the major increases in sg a expense were mergers and acquisitions consultant fees incurred in fy were converted to selling expense as part of the commission for the sale of our former words subsidiary after the close of that sale 
this conversion of consulting fees to selling expense commission gives the appearance of a  increase in consulting fees in fy compared with fy commission expense increased by  or  to  in fy from  in fy we incurred higher commissions to our dealers in japan and china as they increased their sales 
insurance expense increased by  or  to  in fy from  in fy both from an increase in the number of employees  as well as an overall increase in insurance premiums with the largest increases in health insurance 
the major decreases in sg a expense were advertising expense decreased by  or  to  in fy from  in fy due to ads placed for nce new chemical entity malaria project in fy while no such ads were placed in fy marketing  labor and travel costs decreased by  or  to  in fy from  in fy in fy  we made significant efforts to expand our market share in china by sending life science personnel to china several times to demonstrate our products 
professional fees paid to outside consultants decreased by  or  to  in fy from  in fy in fy  we incurred extra tax consulting fees relating to the sale of words  valuation services  and legal services related to our attempt to acquire certain assets of entelos in bankruptcy court  while such fees were not incurred in fy thus  increases in sg a expenses outweighed decreases 
research and development we incurred approximately  of research and development costs during fy of this amount   was capitalized and  was expensed 
in fy  we incurred  of research and development costs  of which  was capitalized and  was expensed 
the increase of  or  in total research and development expenditures from fy to fy was due to staff increases and salary increases for existing staff  which outweighed the reduction in nce new chemical entity malaria project costs 
income from operations during fy  we generated income from operations of  as compared to  for fy  an increase of 
we attribute this increase to increases in gross profit and decreases in research and development expense  which outweighed the increase in sg a expense 
other income and expense net other income expense decreased by  or  to  in fy from  in fy this is due to the lower interest income and lower currency exchange gain in fy compared with fy  and a decrease in sublease income from words as they closed their operations in march provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for fy increased by  or  to  compared to  for fy due to higher taxable income 
income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations for fy increased by  or  to  compared to  for fy we attribute this increase in net income to increased gross profit and decrease in research and development expense  and decrease in tax expense  which outweighed the increase in sg a expense  the decrease in other income  and increase in tax expense 
seasonality sales in our business segment exhibits some seasonal fluctuations  with the fourth fiscal quarter june august generally having the lowest sales over the past three fiscal years because of summer vacations and reduced activities at our customers sites 
this unaudited quarterly sales information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual information presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k and  in the opinion of management  reflects all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair presentation of the information presented 
net sales for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period  however  because our pharmaceutical software is licensed on an annual basis  renewals are usually within the same quarter year after year 
net sales in thousands fy first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total liquidity and capital resources our principal source of capital has been cash flow from our operations 
we have achieved continuous positive operating cash flow over the last nine fiscal years 
we believe that our existing capital and anticipated funds from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements  we may open a revolving line of credit with a bank  or we may have to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain expanded credit facilities 
in the event such financing is needed in the future  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us  or  if available  that it will be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us 
we are not aware of any trends or demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in a decrease in liquidity of our assets 
the trend over the last ten years has been increasing cash deposits from our operating cash flows  and we expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures as of the end of the latest fiscal period 
we continue to seek opportunities for strategic acquisitions 
if one or more such acquisitions is identified  a substantial portion of our cash reserves may be required to complete it  however  we intend to maintain sufficient cash reserves after any acquisition to provide reasonable assurance that outside financing will not be necessary to continue operations 
if we identify an attractive acquisition that would require more cash to complete than we are willing or able to use from our cash reserves  we will consider financing options to complete the acquisition  including obtaining loans and issuing additional securities 
because we have not been able to find suitable acquisitions for several years  the board of directors decided to distribute a portion of our cash reserves to our shareholders  declaring an ongoing per share per quarter cash dividend beginning with the second quarter of fy quarterly dividend payments made in fy and fy are listed in the following table 
record date distribution date number of shares outstanding on record date dividend per share total amount as a tax benefit to our shareholders considering the increase in federal income tax for capital gains in  the board of directors declared an accelerated cash dividend  per share  on december   consisting of all of the planned february distribution of per share  plus per share of the planned per quarter per share for the remaining three fiscal quarters ending in calendar year the board of directors decided to increase the may and august dividend distributions by from the planned share to share 
there can be no assurances that our board of directors will continue the dividend distributions for any specified number of quarters  however  there is no current plan to discontinue the quarterly dividend distributions 
after the end of this reporting period  our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of per share for november  an increase of over the planned per share that remained after the accelerated distribution in december unusual or infrequent events on november   we sold our entire interest in our former wholly owned subsidiary  words  an augmentative and alternative communication device manufacturer  for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
we recognized a gain of approximately  net of tax  from the sale of words  which is included in discontinued operations in our statement of operations for the fiscal year ended august  the difference between the sales price and the net gain is a result of adjustments to net working capital from august   until the closing on november   legal fees  auditing fees  tax specialist s fees  and severance compensation for terminated employees 
known trends or uncertainties although we have not seen any significant reduction in revenues to date  we have seen consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry during the current economic downturn 
this trend has not had a negative effect on our total sales to that industry  however  these consolidations and downsizing in the industry could have an impact on our revenues and earnings going forward 
we believe that the need for improved productivity in the research and development activities directed toward developing new medicines will continue to result in increasing adoption of simulation and modeling tools such as those we produce 
new product developments in the pharmaceutical business segments could result in increased revenues and earnings if they are accepted by our markets  however  there can be no assurances that new products will result in significant improvements to revenues or earnings 
for competitive reasons  we do not disclose all of our new product development activities 
our continued quest for acquisitions in the pharmaceutical business segment could result in a significant change to revenues and earnings if one or more such acquisitions are completed 
inflation we have not been affected materially by inflation during the periods presented  and no material effect is expected in the near future 
off balance sheet arrangements as of august   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
recently issued or newly adopted accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standards update  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  which amended the guidance in accounting standards update testing goodwill for impairment to simplify the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 
asu becomes effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning on or after september  and earlier adoption is permitted 
we adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year we believe adoption did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
significant accounting policies estimates our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  accounting for capitalized software development costs  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues related to software licenses and software maintenance in accordance with the fasb accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition 
software products revenue is recorded when the following conditions are met evidence of arrangement exists  delivery has been made  the amount is fixed  and collectability is probable 
post contract customer support pcs obligations are insignificant  therefore  revenue for pcs is recognized at the same time as the licensing fee  and the costs of providing such support services are accrued and amortized over the obligation period 
as a byproduct of ongoing improvements and upgrades for the new programs and new modules of software  some modifications are provided to our customers who have already purchased software at no additional charge 
other software modifications result in new  additional cost modules that expand the functionality of the software 
these are licensed separately 
we consider the modifications that are provided without charge to be minimal  as they do not significantly change the basic functionality or utility of the software  but rather add convenience  such as being able to plot some additional variable on a graph in addition to the numerous variables that had been available before  or adding some additional calculations to supplement the information provided from running the software 
such software modifications for any single product have typically occurred once or twice per year  sometimes more  sometimes less 
thus  they are infrequent 
the company provides  for a fee  additional training and service calls to its customers and recognizes revenue at the time the training or service call is provided 
generally  we enter into one year license agreements with customers for the use of our pharmaceutical software products 
we recognize revenue on these contracts when all the criteria are met 
most license agreements have a term of one year  however  from time to time  we enter into multi year license agreements 
we generally unlock and invoice software one year at a time for multi year licenses 
therefore  revenue is recognized one year at a time 
we recognize the revenue from collaboration research and the revenue from grants equally over their terms 
however  we recognize the contract study revenue using the percentage of completion method  depending upon how the contract studies are engaged  in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts 
to recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method  we must determine whether we meet the following criteria there is a long term  legally enforceable contract and it is possible to reasonably estimate the total project costs  and it is possible to reasonably estimate the extent of progress toward completion 
capitalized computer software development costs software development costs are capitalized in accordance with fasb asc  costs of software to be sold leased  or marketed 
capitalization of software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility and is discontinued when the product is available for sale 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment for recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors including  but not limited to  technological feasibility  anticipated future gross revenues  estimated economic life  and changes in software and hardware technologies 
capitalized computer software development costs are comprised primarily of salaries and direct payroll related costs and the purchase of existing software to be used in the company s software products 
amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is provided on a product by product basis on the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the products not to exceed five years 
amortization of software development costs amounted to  and  for the years ended august  and  respectively 
we expect future amortization expense to vary due to increases in capitalized computer software development costs 
we test capitalized computer software development costs for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
income taxes we utilize fasb asc  income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the provision for income taxes represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the california franchise tax board ftb audited us for the fiscal years ended fye august  and we received refunds as we claimed  however they continued their audit to include fiscal years and  and were reviewing and r d credits  since those credits were carried forward to fye and in may  we received a letter from the ftb stating that an audit will not be conducted for those years at this time  however it may be subject to future audit if they receive new information 
in march  we also received a notice from the internal revenue service irs that our fiscal year ended august  was subject to their examination 
in october  the irs completed their examination of our tax filing 
the outcome of this examination was a decrease of  in the amount refundable 
we received a refund of  in december stock based compensation we account for stock options using the modified prospective method in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation fasb 
under this method  compensation costs include compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
amortized over the options vesting period  and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  amortized on a straight line basis over the options vesting period 
stock based compensation was  and  for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively  and is included in the consolidated statements of operations as consulting  salaries  and research and development expense 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company
