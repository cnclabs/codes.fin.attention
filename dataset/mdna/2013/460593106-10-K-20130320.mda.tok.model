item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition revenues consist of product and service revenues and are recognized in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition 
product revenues and electronic manufacturing services revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided fees are fixed and determinable  a customer purchase order is obtained when applicable  and collection is probable 
sales tax collected from customers and remitted to the applicable taxing authorities is accounted for on a net basis  with no impact to revenues 
service revenue  other than electronics manufacturing services revenue  is recognized as the services are performed 
deferred revenue consists primarily of service revenue not yet performed 
our long term engineering design services are typically provided on a fixed fee basis 
the revenues for such projects that require significant customization and integration are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
in using the percentage of completion method  revenues are generally recorded based on the percentage of effort incurred to date on a contract relative to the estimated total expected contract effort 
significant judgment is required when estimating total contract effort and progress to completion on the arrangements as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract 
management uses historical experience  project plans and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates 
uncertainties include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control 
changes in these estimates could result in a material impact on revenues and net earnings loss 
if we are unable to develop reasonably dependable cost or revenue estimates  the completed contract method is applied under which all revenues and related costs are deferred until the contract is completed 
warranty reserve the company offers to its customers a limited warranty that its products will be free from defect in the materials and workmanship for a specified period 
the company has established a warranty reserve  as a component of accrued liabilities  for any potential claims 
the company estimates its warranty reserve based upon an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve those claims 
changes in claim rates and differences between actual and expected warranty costs could impact the warranty reserve estimates 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company records accounts receivable at their net realizable value  which requires management to estimate the collectability of the company s trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
management evaluates all accounts periodically and a reserve is established based on the best facts available to management 
this reserve is also partially determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories based on historical results and is reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for returns the company maintains an allowance for returns  based upon expected return rates  when such return rates are estimable 
the estimates of expected return rates are generally a factor of historical returns 
changes in return rates could impact the allowance for return estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market involves an inherent level of risk and uncertainty due to technology trends in the industry and customer demand for our products 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand decreases due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
the company has experienced significant changes in required reserves in the past due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines and declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant changes in this estimate may occur in the future as market conditions change 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
management estimates are necessary in determining compensation expense for both restricted stock and stock options with performance based vesting criteria 
compensation expense for this type of stock based award is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable condition is expected to be met 
if the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved  no expense is recognized until such time as the performance condition is considered probable of being met  if ever 
management evaluates whether performance conditions are probable of occurring on a quarterly basis 
income taxes the company determines its deferred taxes using the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax law 
the company s consolidated financial statements include deferred income taxes arising from the recognition of revenues and expenses in different periods for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realizable 
the company considers recent historical losses  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
management is continuously assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the company recognizes the impact of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return in the financial statements at the amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not of being sustained 
the company is periodically engaged in various tax audits by federal  state and foreign governmental authorities incidental to its business activities 
the company records reserves for its estimated probable losses of these proceedings  if applicable 
the company is currently under a tax audit in france 
consolidated statement of operations as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenues cost of sales gross margin research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charge loss from operations interest income  net other loss  net loss before income tax income tax provision benefit net loss overview our financial results reflect a general slowdown in telecommunications spending worldwide 
this slowdown  coupled with the shift in subscriber growth toward emerging countries  where our customers have not been able to secure dominate market share  and the shift from circuit switched network architectures toward packet based ip network architectures resulted in a significant reduction in revenues from our telecommunications products 
we expected that the revenue growth from our engineering design and manufacturing services offerings along with revenues generated by the market release of penveu to be sufficient to not only offset the reductions in the telecommunications products but to provide a source of overall revenue growth in while revenue from our engineering design and manufacturing services increased approximately in  it was the delay in bringing penveu to market which had the largest impact on our plan to fill this revenue gap 
while we were excited to announce penveu to the market in april of  we encountered several delays in the market release of the product due to several significant technical issues with the product 
however  we believe that these technical issues have been largely resolved  and we expect to provide beta units to customers for testing soon 
we expect penveu to be a major revenue producer for us in additionally  we expect to continue to achieve revenue growth in engineering design and manufacturing services and anticipate some stabilization to occur in our telecommunications product revenues in results of operations revenues total revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
revenues decreased by in compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to our telecommunications product revenues  which decreased by approximately to million in compared to million in this decrease reflects a general slowdown in telecommunications spending worldwide 
this slowdown  coupled with the shift in subscriber growth toward emerging countries  where our customers have not been able to secure dominate market share  and the shift from circuit switched network architectures toward packet based ip network architectures resulted in a significant reduction in revenues from our telecommunications products

our services revenues increased approximately to million in compared to approximately million in all other revenues decreased slightly to  in compared to  in revenues increased by in compared to this increase was primarily attributable to our telecommunications product revenues  which increased by approximately to million in compared to million in  primarily as the result of design wins that  in some cases  we won over two years ago 
additionally  our services revenues  including our first meaningful revenues from electronic manufacturing services  increased approximately to million in compared to approximately million in our enterprise product revenues were consistent at million in and all other revenues increased slightly to  in compared to  in gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to was primarily due to decreased utilization of our manufacturing facility 
we believe that pricing pressures in the industry and our anticipated future mix of our products and services may continue to reduce our gross margin percentage in future periods 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to was primarily due to a shift in product mix toward lower margin products and services  partially offset by increased utilization of our manufacturing facility and a decrease of  in excess and obsolete inventory charges 
research and development our investment in the development of new products through research and development was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses were  and for  and  respectively 
research and development expenses decreased in compared to by  during  there was an increase in professional services activities  which resulted in an increase in services revenues 
engineering costs associated with these activities generate revenue  therefore  the related expenses are recorded as cost of sales rather than research and development operating expenses  resulting in a decrease of approximately in research and development expenses in compared to in addition  there was a decrease in personnel and related expenses of approximately  primarily as a result of the restructuring plan 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the restructuring plan 
furthermore  variable research and development project related expenses decreased approximately during the year 
the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue is due to revenue decreasing at a higher rate than research and development expense 
we will continue to monitor the level of our investments in research and development concurrently with actual revenue results 
research and development expenses decreased in compared to by approximately million 
the decrease was primarily due to the closure of our european engineering and support center located in chaville  france as a result of the restructuring plan

restructuring charge on october   we committed to a plan intended to improve the balance between our telecommunications product expenses with the reduced revenue levels of this product line 
under the restructuring plan  we reduced our workforce by regular full time positions 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of  classified as an operating expense  in the fourth quarter of related to future cash expenditures to cover employee severance and benefits 
this plan is expected to result in savings of approximately million to million in annualized operating costs 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the restructuring plan 
on september   we initiated a restructuring plan to mitigate gross margin erosion by reducing manufacturing and procurement costs  streamline research and development expense and focus remaining resources on key strategic growth areas  and reduce selling and administrative expenses through product rationalization and consolidation of support functions 
under the restructuring plan  we reduced our worldwide work force by regular full time positions  including the closure of our european engineering and support center located in chaville  france

see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the restructuring plan 
interest income  net interest income  net of interest expense  was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income  net of interest expense  in compared to was primarily due to lower investment balances and lower rates of return on our investments 
other loss  net other loss  net was  in  zero in and  in other loss  net in primarily relates to the change in market value of a foreign exchange derivative financial instrument which resulted in a loss of approximately  we did not hold any foreign exchange contracts during or see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our derivative financial instruments 
income taxes the effective income tax rates for the periods presented differ from the us statutory rate as we continue to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at december   and the income tax expense for was nearly equally due to tax in domestic and foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax expense for was primarily due to tax in a foreign jurisdiction 
the tax benefit rate for was 
the income tax benefit for was primarily due to a research and development tax credit earned by our operations in france 
the benefits from the research and development tax credit were partially offset by tax expense related to income generated in france 
we no longer generate tax credits from french research and development activities because we closed our french operations at the end of net loss we reported a net loss of approximately million   and million for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
recently announced product on april  we announced the debut of penveu  a handheld device that adds interactivity to the installed base of projectors and large screen displays  making any flat surface  from pull down screens to hdtvs  an interactive display system 
using embedded computer vision technology  penveu works with any device with a vga connection and requires no software or driver installation  no particular operating system  and no periodic calibration 
penveu is targeted at the education and enterprise markets 
an independent source estimates the interactive whiteboard market to grow to approximately billion in revenue in however  penveu also has the unique ability to turn the estimated over million projectors and million large screen displays that are currently installed worldwide into interactive display devices 
the retail price of penveu will be less than of the average price of a typical installed interactive whiteboard  and unlike an interactive whiteboard  penveu will not require the time and expense of installation 
penveu will be offered and sold through our website  other online retailers and catalogs 
we continue to make significant investments in development  marketing and infrastructure associated with penveu to position this important product for a successful market release in liquidity and capital resources consolidated cash flows cash and cash equivalents decreased by million for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents increased by million for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million for the year ended december  cash flows are impacted by operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities trends in cash flows from operating activities for  and are generally similar to the trends in our earnings adjusted by the recovery of provision for uncollectible accounts and returns  provision for excess and obsolete inventories  depreciation and amortization  amortization of stock based compensation and write off of impaired capitalized software  property and equipment 
cash used in operating activities totaled million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities totaled  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities totaled million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  we recovered  during and  during in uncollectible accounts and returns due to improved collection results in each year 
provision for excess and obsolete inventories decreased by  and  in and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization decreased by  and  in and  respectively 
amortization of stock based compensation increased by  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in amortization of stock based compensation during was primarily due to the issuance of  time based stock options during see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on stock based compensation 
during and  there were no write offs of capitalized software  property and equipment 
during  there were write offs of capitalized software  property and equipment of  primarily related to the restructuring actions taken during the third quarter of changes in assets and liabilities result primarily from the timing of production  sales  purchases and payments 
such changes in assets and liabilities generally tend to even out over time and result in trends in cash flows from operating activities generally reflecting earnings trends 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled  for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities totaled million and million in and  respectively 
cash used in or provided by investing activities in each of the three years presented related principally to our investments in marketable securities  additions to property and equipment and capitalized software purchases 
additions to property and equipment during primarily related to software and equipment purchases for penveu and for our manufacturing function 
additions to property and equipment during primarily related to software and equipment purchases for our engineering  manufacturing and administrative functions 
additions to property and equipment during primarily related to software and equipment purchases for our engineering and manufacturing functions 
purchases of marketable securities increased by approximately million for compared to purchases of marketable securities increased by approximately million for compared to proceeds from the sale of marketable securities increased by approximately million for compared to proceeds from the sale of marketable securities increased by approximately million for compared to financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no net cash provided by or used in financing activities for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities for and consisted solely of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
commitments at december   we had no material commitments to purchase capital assets  however  planned capital expenditures for are estimated at approximately  a significant portion of which relates to enhancements to our manufacturing equipment 
our significant long term obligations are operating leases on facilities and phone systems and future debt payments 
in addition  at december   we had approximately  of non cancelable purchase commitments for materials and hardware 
we have not paid any dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations and payment commitments as of december  in thousands contractual obligation payments due by period total year years years years long term debt obligation  operating lease obligations  total at december   we had borrowings of million under a million revolving credit facility with a bank 
the revolving credit facility matures on december  and is secured throughout the term of the credit facility by marketable securities 
we incur interest expense on the borrowings from the revolving credit facility at a rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus to applicable margin rate based on certain factors included in our credit agreement 
at december   our interest rate on the borrowings from the revolving credit facility was 
we used the rate to estimate interest expense for through december the interest expense estimate is  annually for the years through december we lease our facilities under non cancelable operating leases with the longest terms extending to march our operating lease at our headquarters location includes a  letter of credit issued to our landlord which can only be used in the case of non payment of such lease 
the letter of credit  if accessed  would be funded by our existing revolving credit facility 
we lease our phone system under a non cancelable operating lease extending to october off balance sheet arrangements in an attempt to mitigate foreign currency risk  we have entered into  from time to time  foreign exchange contracts to purchase a fixed amount of euros on a fixed date in the future at a fixed rate determined at the contract date 
at december  and  we had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
other management believes that cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility  together with cash on hand  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service for the next twelve months 
to the extent our actual operating results or other developments differ from our expectations  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and available resources in view of  among other things  our capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past sought  and may in the future seek  to raise additional capital  refinance or restructure indebtedness  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock or take a combination of such steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we may review opportunities for acquisitions  joint ventures or other business combinations 
in the event of any such transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing additional equity securities or increasing the indebtedness of the company or its subsidiaries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business on a global basis and  in some cases  in foreign currencies 
the company s operations in france were transacted in the local currency and converted into us dollars based on published exchange rates for the periods reported and were therefore subject to risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the euro to us dollar translation accounted for charges of approximately   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this risk was significantly reduced due to the closure of our french operations at the end of in an attempt to mitigate the risk described above  we have entered into  from time to time  foreign exchange contracts to purchase a fixed amount of euros on a fixed date in the future at a fixed rate determined at the contract date 
these derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify as hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging  and therefore any change in the market value of these contracts resulting in a gain or loss is recognized as other loss  net in the period of the change 
there were no foreign exchange contracts held by the company at any point during the years ended december  and  and thus there was no related gain or loss 
for the year ended december   we recognized a loss of approximately  related to a foreign exchange contract 
at december  and  there were no foreign exchange contracts outstanding 
market price risk we had no equity hedge contracts outstanding as of december  or interest rate risk our investments are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of interest earning financial instruments  including bank time deposits  money market funds  and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national governmental entities and agencies 
due to the demand nature of our money market funds and the short term nature of our time deposits and debt securities portfolio  these assets are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we manage this risk through investments with shorter term maturities and varying maturity dates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate decrease of less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our marketable securities at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate decrease of less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  we maintain a million revolving bank credit facility maturing december  with an applicable interest rate on any outstanding balances under the credit facility based on london interbank offered rate libor plus a to applicable margin rate based on certain factors included in our credit agreement 
the interest rate on the borrowings under the revolving credit facility was and at december  and  respectively 
the unused portion of the credit facility is subject to an unused facility fee ranging from 
to 
depending on total deposits with the creditor 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor would increase annual interest expense on this credit facility by approximately  all borrowings under this facility are secured by marketable securities 
subsequent to december  and prior to the company s filing of the consolidated financial statements  the outstanding balance on the credit facility was repaid
