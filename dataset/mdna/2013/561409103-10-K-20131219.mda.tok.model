item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company s results of operations are primarily dependent on the results of the bank  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the bank currently operates eight financial center offices in chester and delaware counties  which are located in southeastern pennsylvania approximately miles west of downtown philadelphia 
the bank s primary business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds together with funds we borrow to originate loans to our customers 
at september   we had total assets of million  including million in net portfolio loans  million in loans held for sale and million of investment securities  total deposits of million and total shareholders equity of million 
our results of operations depend  to a large extent  on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and investment portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses  fee income and other  non interest income and non interest expenses 
our other  or non interest  expenses principally consist of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  data processing  advertising and business promotion  professional fees  other real estate owned expense and other expense 
our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial conditions and results of operations 
our business strategy currently is focused on improving core earnings  seeking relief from the supervisory agreement  maintaining low levels of problem assets and conducting our traditional community oriented banking business 
below are certain of the highlights of our business strategy in recent years improving core earnings 
with interest rates falling to historically low levels  it has become increasingly difficult for financial institutions to maintain acceptable levels of net interest income 
in recent years  with the bank unable to grow its asset base and loan portfolio  increasing interest income has been a challenge 
this lack of growth in the loan portfolio  combined with higher deposit and borrowing costs  have all contributed to a decline in the banks net interest margin 
in an effort to achieve consistent sustainable earnings  ie improve the net interest margin  we are implementing specific product and pricing strategies designed to increase the yield on loans and reduce the cost of funding 
during fiscal  we expect to resume originating commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans  which have higher yields than single family residential mortgage loans  on a relatively modest basis in accordance with our business plan and our strengthened loan underwriting and loan administration policies and procedures 
we also have established a funding composition plan  which is designed to increase checking accounts  primarily non interest bearing accounts  as well as savings and money market accounts 
we are attempting to increase our core deposits  which we define as all deposit accounts other than certificates of deposit 
at september   our core deposits amounted to of total deposits million  compared to of total deposits million at september  we have continued our promotional efforts to increase core deposits 
we review our deposit products on an ongoing basis and we are considering additional deposit products and are currently offering more flexible delivery options  such as mobile banking  as part of our efforts to increase core deposits 
we expect to increase our commercial checking accounts and we plan to enhance our cross marketing as part of our efforts to gain additional deposit relationships with our loan customers 
the implementation of these strategies began in the month of september  when the bank prepaid million in fhlb advances with a weighted average rate of 
we have replaced the fhlb advances with lower costing sources of funds which will lower our interest expense in fiscal by  compared to the amount had we not prepaid the fhlb advances 

table of contents seek supervisory relief 
we entered into the supervisory agreements with the ots in october among other things  the supervisory agreements required that we provide the occ with relatively extensive reports and data on our business and operations on a quarterly basis 
given the improvements we have seen in the levels of our non performing and other problem assets  the enhancements we have made to our loan underwriting policies and procedures  as well as our loan administration and oversight policies and procedures and the increased capital levels that we have achieved as a result of the stock offering  we plan to continue our efforts to obtain relief from the supervisory agreement that the bank entered into in as well as the imcrs that the occ has imposed 
maintain low levels of problem assets 
we are continuing in our efforts to improve asset quality 
at september   our total non performing assets in portfolio were million or of total assets  reflecting a reduction of million  or  compared to million of total non performing assets at september  when total non performing assets amounted to of total assets 
the recent bulk sale of problem loans resulted in a dramatic reduction of the company s non performing assets 
the bulk sale was undertaken as an efficient mechanism for disposing of non performing and underperforming assets and improving the bank s credit quality in the process 
as a result of the sale  the company significantly reduced its exposure to sectors that experienced economic weakness and significant declines in collateral valuations and has substantially reduced the amount of non accruing loans 
growing our loan portfolio and resuming commercial real estate and construction and development lending 
we plan to resume  on a relatively modest basis  the origination of commercial real estate loans and construction and development loans in our market area 
such loans will be underwritten in accordance with our strengthened loan underwriting standards and our enhanced credit review and administration procedures 
we continue to believe that we can be a successful niche lender to small and mid sized commercial borrowers and homebuilders in our market area 
in light of the improvements in economic conditions and real estate values  we believe that a resumption of commercial real estate and construction and development lending in a planned  deliberative fashion with the loan underwriting and administration enhancements that we have implemented in recent periods  together with modest loan growth  will increase our interest income and our returns in future periods 
increasing market share penetration 
we operate in a competitive market area for banking products and services 
in recent years  we have been working to increase our deposit share in chester and delaware counties and we increased our marketing and promotional efforts 
however  as a result of the shrinkage of our balance sheet and the reduction in total deposits in fiscal and  our deposit market share in chester county decreased from in to in in our effort to increase market share as well as non interest income  we plan to evaluate increasing our business in non traditional products  such as wealth management 
continuing to provide exceptional customer service 
as a community oriented savings bank  we take pride in providing exceptional customer service as a means to attract and retain customers 
we deliver personalized service to our customers that distinguish us from the large regional banks operating in our market area 
our management team has strong ties to and deep roots in  the local community 
we believe that we know our customers banking needs and can respond quickly to address them 

table of contents this management s discussion and analysis section is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of malvern bancorp 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies in reviewing and understanding financial information for malvern bancorp  inc  you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in item of this annual report on form k 
the accounting and financial reporting policies of malvern bancorp conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and to general practices within the banking industry 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions  which are believed to be reasonable  based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented 
the following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the statement of financial condition date and is recorded as a reduction to loans 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents management s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses  and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries 
loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses  and subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
all  or part  of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
non residential consumer loans are generally charged off no later than when they become days past due on a contractual basis or earlier in the event of the borrower s bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance is based on the company s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  the composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the allowance consists of specific  general and unallocated components 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired 
for loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers pools of loans by loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired  as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as residential real estate  home equity and other consumer loans 
these pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based upon historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans  as adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
once all factor adjustments are applied  general reserve allocations for each segment are calculated  summarized and reported on the alll summary 
alll final schedules  calculations and the resulting evaluation process are reviewed quarterly by the asset classification committee and the board of directors 

table of contents in addition  federal bank regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not previously have been available to management 
based on management s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio  management believes the level of the allowance for loan losses at september  was appropriate under us gaap 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and industrial loans  commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the allowance is adjusted for other significant factors that affect the collectibility of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date including changes in lending policy and procedures  loan volume and concentrations  seasoning of the portfolio  loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  and bank regulatory examination results 
other factors include changes in economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas and credit quality trends 
loss factors are reevaluated each reporting period to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
we review key ratios such as the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable and as a percentage of non performing loans  however  we do not try to maintain any specific target range for these ratios 
while management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance 
in addition  the occ  as an integral part of its examination processes  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses 
the occ may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
other real estate owned 
assets acquired through foreclosure consist of other real estate owned and financial assets acquired from debtors 
other real estate owned is carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
the fair value of other real estate owned is determined using current market appraisals obtained from approved independent appraisers  agreements of sale  and comparable market analysis from real estate brokers  where applicable 
changes in the fair value of assets acquired through foreclosure at future reporting dates or at the time of disposition will result in an adjustment in assets acquired through foreclosure expense or net gain loss on sale of assets acquired through foreclosure  respectively 
fair value measurements 
the company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets to determine fair value disclosures 
investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis  such as impaired loans  real estate owned and certain other assets 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 

table of contents under fasb asc topic  fair value measurements  the company groups its assets at fair value in three levels  based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value 
these levels are level valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset 
under fasb asc topic  the company bases its fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
it is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in fasb asc topic fair value measurements for assets where there exists limited or no observable market data and  therefore  are based primarily upon the company s or other third party s estimates  are often calculated based on the characteristics of the asset  the economic and competitive environment and other such factors 
therefore  the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset 
additionally  there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique  and changes in the underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  that could significantly affect the results of current or future valuations 
at september   the company had million of assets that were measured at fair value on a non recurring basis using level measurements 
income taxes 
we make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets dtas  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
we also estimate a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
these estimates and judgments are inherently subjective 
historically  our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision to our initial estimates 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
realization of a deferred tax asset requires us to exercise significant judgment and is inherently uncertain because it requires the prediction of future occurrences 
our net deferred tax asset amounted to million at september  compared to million at september  in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we must estimate our taxable income in future years and viable tax planning strategies we could employ so that the asset would not go unused 
due primarily to the net loss recognized in the fiscal year ended september   which primarily resulted from the loss on our bulk loan sale transaction and the penalties incurred upon our prepayment of fhlb advances  our total deferred tax assets increased to million at september  compared to million at september  upon our review of the available positive and negative evidence  we determined that a dta valuation allowance of million should be established at september  these actions on the valuation allowance resulted in a million charge to earnings in the quarter and fiscal year ended september  in the future  the dta allowance may be reversed  depending on the company s financial position and results of operations in the future  among other factors  and  in such event  may be available to increase future net income 
there can be no assurance  however  as to when we could be in a position to recapture our dta allowance 

table of contents other than temporary impairment of securities securities are evaluated on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation  to determine whether declines in their value are other than temporary 
to determine whether a loss in value is other than temporary  management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline  the magnitude and duration of the decline and whether or not management intends to sell or expects that it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery of the fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value for a debt security is determined to be other than temporary  the other than temporary impairment is separated into a the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security the credit loss and b the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to all other factors 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
how we manage market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk which is inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages interest rate risk exposure 
in addition to market risk  our primary risk is credit risk on our loan portfolio 
we attempt to manage credit risk through our loan underwriting and oversight policies 
the principal objective of our interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk embedded in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with approved guidelines 
we seek to manage our exposure to risks from changes in interest rates while at the same time trying to improve our net interest spread 
we monitor interest rate risk as such risk relates to our operating strategies 
we have established an alco committee  which is comprised of our president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief lending officer and five outside directors  and which is responsible for reviewing our asset liability and investment policies and interest rate risk position 
the alco committee meets on a regular basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on future earnings 
in recent years  we primarily have utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk we have attempted to match fund a portion of our loan portfolio with borrowings having similar expected lives  on occasion  we have sold long term year fixed rate mortgage loans with servicing retained  we have attempted  where possible  to extend the maturities of our deposits and borrowings  and we have invested in securities with relatively short anticipated lives  generally one to three years  and we hold significant amounts of liquid assets 
as part of our asset liability management efforts  during fiscal year ended september   we sold million of long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans with the servicing retained 
this transaction resulted in a gain of  in addition  in order to reduce our average cost of funds in future periods  during the quarter and fiscal year ended september   we prepaid million of fhlb advances which had a weighted average cost of and incurred million in prepayment penalties 
finally  in light of the removal of the lending restrictions from the bank s supervisory agreement  we are resuming  on a relatively modest basis subject to our business plan and our strengthened loan underwriting and loan administration policies and procedures  origination of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans  both of which generally have higher yields than single family residential mortgage loans 

table of contents gap analysis 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset and liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to affect adversely net interest income 
our one year cumulative gap was a negative at september  compared to a negative at september  
table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at september   which we expect  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown the gap table 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at september   on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans  and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
annual prepayment rates for single family and other mortgage loans are assumed to range from to 
the weighted average life for investment securities is assumed to range from year to years 
savings accounts and interest bearing checking accounts are assumed to have annual rates of withdrawal  or decay rates  of and  respectively

for purposes of the gap analysis  loans receivable includes non performing loans gross of the allowance for loan losses  undisbursed loan funds  unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees 
interest rate sensitivity gap represents the net cumulative difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
net portfolio value and net interest income analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of models which generate estimates of the change in its net portfolio value npv and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 

table of contents the table below sets forth as of september  and  the estimated changes in our net portfolio value that would result from designated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rates changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
as of september  as of september  changes in interest rates basis points amount dollar change from base percentage change from base amount dollar change from base percentage change from base dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates 
a basis point equals 
in addition to modeling changes in npv  we also analyze potential changes to nii for a twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table shows our nii model as of september  changes in interest rates in basis points rate shock net interest income change change dollars in thousands static as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv and nii require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results 

table of contents average balances  net interest income  and yields earned and rates paid 
the following table shows for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates  and the net interest margin 
tax exempt income and yields have not been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis

these decreases were partially offset by an aggregate million increase in investment securities 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents at september  compared to september  was due to a million refund of excess stock subscriptions received in our second step conversion and stock offering  the utilization of cash to purchase additional investment securities and to prepay million in advances from the fhlb during fiscal we also replaced a portion of the prepaid advances with the addition of million of new fhlb advances in fiscal the million decrease in net portfolio loans receivable was due primarily to the transfer of a net of million of loans after an aggregate of million in charge offs to held for sale status at december  as well as normal amortization and prepayments of our loans in portfolio 
during fiscal  we recorded a million decline in our portfolio of commercial real estate loans  a million decrease in our portfolio of residential and commercial construction and development loans as well as an million decrease in consumer second mortgage loans 
our total liabilities at september   were million compared to million at september  the million  or decrease in total liabilities was due primarily to the elimination of the million stock subscription escrow  reflecting the closing of our second step conversion on october   and a million decrease in total deposits 
our total deposits were million at september  compared to million at september  there was a million decrease in our fhlb advances for fiscal the decrease in fhlb advances was due to prepaying million in advances during the month of september  which was partially offset by a million purchase in lower costing advances during fiscal 
table of contents our shareholders equity increased by million to million at september  compared to million at september  the increase was due to the million in net proceeds received from the stock offering undertaken as part of the second step conversion of the bank from the mutual holding company structure to the stock holding company structure  which was completed on october  our ratio of equity to assets was at september  comparison of operating results for the years ended september  and september  general 
our net loss was million for the year ended september  compared to net income of million for the year ended september  on a per share basis  the net loss was per share for the year ended september   compared to net income of per share as adjusted for our second step conversion for the year ended september  the reason for the million difference in our results of operations in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year was due to an increase in the provision of loan losses of million  a million decrease in net interest income  a million increase in other expenses  as well as million increase in income tax expense 
our interest rate spread was and our net interest margin was for the year ended september   compared to a net interest spread of and a net interest margin of for the year ended september  interest and dividend income 
our interest and dividend income decreased for the year ended september  by million or over fiscal to million 
interest income on loans decreased for the year ended september  over fiscal by million  or 
the decrease in interest earned on loans in fiscal was due to a basis point decrease in the average yield earned on our loan portfolio in fiscal compared to fiscal as well as a million or  decrease in the average balance of our outstanding loan portfolio 
interest income on investment securities increased by  or  in fiscal over the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest income on investment securities in fiscal was due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of our investment securities portfolio 
interest expense 
our interest expense for the year ended september  was million  a decrease of million from the year ended september  the reason for the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was a basis point decrease in average rate paid on total deposits together with a decrease in the average balance of our total deposits of million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to a million decrease in the average balance of money market accounts 
the average rate paid on total deposits decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal our expense on borrowings was relatively constant  and amounted to million in fiscal and the average balance of our borrowings decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  and the average rate paid on borrowed funds decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal as previously described  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we prepaid million of fhlb advances which had a weighted average cost of 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we replaced a portion of the prepaid advances with million of new fhlb advances which have a weighted average cost of 
we expect these actions to reduce our interest expense by approximately  in fiscal provision for loan losses 
management has identified the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy
