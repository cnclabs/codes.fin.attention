we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
overview seattle genetics is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of monoclonal antibody based therapies for cancer 
our lead product adcetris  or brentuximab vedotin  received accelerated approval in the united states in and approval with conditions in canada in for patients with relapsed hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma  or salcl 
adcetris is an antibody drug conjugate  or adc  comprising an anti cd monoclonal antibody attached by a protease cleavable linker to a microtubule disrupting agent  monomethyl auristatin e mmae  utilizing our proprietary technology 
we have a broad development strategy for adcetris evaluating its potential application in earlier lines of therapy for patients with hodgkin lymphoma or mature t cell lymphoma  or mtcl  and in other cd positive malignancies 
in addition  we have four clinical stage adc programs  which consist of sgn  asg me  asg me and sgn cda  as well as several preclinical product candidates  including sgn cda and sgn liva 
we are collaborating with millennium the takeda oncology company  or millennium  to develop and commercialize adcetris on a global basis 
under this collaboration  seattle genetics has retained commercial rights for adcetris in the united states and its territories and in canada  and millennium has commercial rights in the rest of the world 
adcetris was granted conditional approval in the european union in for patients with relapsed hodgkin lymphoma or relapsed salcl 
we also have collaborations for our adc technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including abbvie biotechnology ltd 
formerly part of abbott laboratories  or abbvie  bayer pharmaceuticals corporation  or bayer  celldex therapeutics  inc  or celldex  daiichi sankyo co  ltd  or daiichi sankyo  genentech  inc  a member of the roche group  or genentech  glaxosmithkline llc  or gsk  millennium  pfizer  inc  or pfizer  and psma development company llc  a subsidiary of progenics pharmaceuticals inc  or progenics  as well as adc co development agreements with agensys  inc  an affiliate of astellas pharma  inc  or agensys  genmab a s  or genmab  and oxford biotherapeutics ltd  or obt 
we began commercializing adcetris in august  and the commercial potential of adcetris and our ability to realize that potential remains uncertain 
our success in commercializing adcetris will require  among other things  effective sales  marketing  manufacturing  distribution  information systems and pricing strategies  as well as compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the fda granted accelerated approval of 
table of contents adcetris which means that we are  among other things  obligated to conduct specific post approval clinical studies to confirm patient benefit as a condition of that approval 
in addition  we are exploring the use of adcetris in earlier lines of therapy in patients with hodgkin lymphoma and mtcl  including salcl  and in other cd positive malignancies 
in order to do this  we are required to conduct additional extensive clinical studies and  if these studies are successful  we intend to seek additional regulatory approvals 
we and millennium are conducting three phase iii clinical trials of adcetris  one in relapsed cutaneous t cell lymphoma  or ctcl  the alcanza trial  one in front line advanced classical hodgkin lymphoma  the echelon trial  and one in front line mtcl  including salcl  the echelon trial 
the fda has agreed to special protocol assessment  or spa  agreements for all three of these phase iii clinical trials 
an spa is an agreement with the fda regarding the design of the clinical trial  including size and clinical endpoints  to support an efficacy claim in a biologics license application submission to the fda if the trial achieves its primary endpoints 
the primary end point in the front line hodgkin lymphoma and front line mtcl trials is modified progression free survival per independent review facility assessment 
the primary endpoint in the ctcl trial is overall response rate  lasting at least months  with adcetris in patients with cd positive mycosis fungoides or primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma compared to that achieved with therapy in the control arm 
we and millennium are also conducting a phase iii clinical trial in post transplant hodgkin lymphoma patients  the aethera trial  to evaluate whether adcetris can extend progression free survival versus placebo in patients following autologous stem cell transplant  or asct 
we have an agreement with ventana medical systems  inc  a member of the roche group  or ventana  under which ventana will develop  manufacture and commercialize a molecular companion diagnostic test with the goal of identifying patients who might respond to treatment with adcetris based on cd expression levels in their tissue specimens 
a molecular companion diagnostic is not required for the current approved indications for adcetris  however  we expect that a molecular companion diagnostic may be required by regulatory authorities to support regulatory approval of adcetris in other cd positive malignancies 
all of these activities will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately prove successful 
our other product candidates are in relatively early stages of development 
these product candidates will require significant further development  financial resources and personnel to obtain regulatory approval and develop into commercially viable products  if at all 
accordingly  over the next several years  we expect that we will incur substantial expenses  primarily as a result of activities related to the commercialization and continued development of adcetris 
we will also continue to invest in research  development and manufacturing of our other product candidates 
our commitment of resources to the continuing development  regulatory and commercialization activities for adcetris and the research  continued development and manufacturing of our other product candidates may require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital and our operating expenses will fluctuate as a result of such activities 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization 
although we have begun to recognize revenue from adcetris product sales in the united states and canada  we have only limited experience commercializing adcetris and our future adcetris product sales will be difficult to accurately predict from period to period 
while we expect that our adcetris net sales will be in the range of million to million in  our product sales revenue may vary significantly from period to period and may be affected by a variety of factors  including the level of demand for adcetris  the duration of therapy for patients receiving adcetris and the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for adcetris is available from government and other third party payers  particularly in an increasingly challenging environment due to  among other things  the attention being paid to health care cost containment and other austerity measures in the us and worldwide 
in addition  we believe that the number of patients in adcetris approved indications is relatively small and that our ongoing sales will be primarily attributable to the incidence of new patients who have recently failed earlier lines of cancer therapy and become eligible for adcetris within the current approved indications 
for these and other reasons  we expect that future adcetris sales growth will be primarily dependent on our ability to expand the labeled indications of use 
this will require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and we may not be successful 
our ability to successfully commercialize adcetris and to expand its labeled indications of use are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in part i  item a of this annual report on 
table of contents form k 
we also expect that amounts earned from our collaboration agreements will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows 
these revenues will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development and clinical milestones by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements  including  in particular  our adcetris collaboration with millennium  as well as entering into new collaboration and license agreements 
our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and  as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our future performance 
financial summary our revenues are generated from a combination of adcetris sales  which began during august  collaboration and license agreements and royalties from the sale of adcetris outside the united states and canada 
collaboration revenues reflect the earned amount of upfront technology access fees  milestone payments  reimbursement for support and materials supplied to our collaborators  and development cost sharing under our product collaborations 
under our adcetris collaboration with millennium  we are entitled to receive royalties based on a percentage of millennium s net sales in its territories 
total revenues increased to million in  compared to million in this increase primarily reflects our product sales of adcetris during the period 
our collaboration and license agreement revenue also increased primarily as a result of our adcetris collaboration with millennium 
total costs and expenses increased to million in  compared to million in the most significant increase was related to our commercial organization which was established during  but was in place for the entire period 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and million in total stockholders equity 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are comprised of adcetris net product sales  amounts earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements and royalties 
revenue recognition is predicated upon persuasive evidence of an agreement existing  delivery of products or services being rendered  amounts payable being fixed or determinable  and collectibility being reasonably assured 
net product sales we sell adcetris through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors 
healthcare providers order adcetris through these distributors 
we receive orders from distributors and ship product directly to the customer 
we record product sales when title and risk of loss pass 
this generally occurs upon delivery to the customer 
product sales are recorded net of estimated government mandated rebates and chargebacks  distribution fees  product returns and other deductions 
reserves are established for these deductions and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable reserves 
we reflect these reserves as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor  or as an accrued liability depending on the nature of the sales deduction 
sales reserves are based on management s estimates that consider payer mix in target markets  industry benchmarks and experience to date 
these estimates involve a substantial degree of judgment 
government mandated rebates and chargebacks we have entered into a medicaid drug rebate agreement  or mdra  with the centers for medicare medicaid services 
this agreement provides for a rebate to participating states based on covered purchases of adcetris 
medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by participating states 
we estimated medicaid rebates based on a third party study of the payer mix for 
table of contents adcetris  information on utilization by medicaid eligible patients who received assistance through seagen secure  our patient assistance program and experience to date 
we also have completed our interim federal supply schedule  or fss  agreement under which certain us government purchasers receive a discount on their purchases of adcetris 
we have entered into a pharmaceutical pricing agreement  or ppa  with the secretary of health and human services which enables certain private entities that qualify for government pricing under the public health services act  or phs  to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of adcetris 
under these agreements  distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wholesale acquisition cost and the discounted price for healthcare providers entitled to fss discounts or phs pricing 
as a result of our direct ship distribution model  we can identify the entities purchasing adcetris and this information enables us to estimate expected chargebacks for fss and phs purchases based on each entity s eligibility for the fss and phs programs 
we also review actual rebate and chargeback information to further refine these estimates 
distribution fees  product returns and other deductions our distributors charge a fee for distribution services that they perform on our behalf 
we are able to calculate the amount due for each distributor based on the amount of sales to each distributor and the negotiated fee 
we allow for the return of product that is within days of its expiration date or that is damaged 
we estimated product returns based on historical industry information of return rates for other specialty pharmaceutical products 
in addition  we considered our direct ship distribution model  our belief that product is typically not held in the distribution channel  and the expected rapid use of the product by healthcare providers 
we provide reimbursement and financial assistance to qualifying patients in the us and its territories who meet various financial need criteria and are underinsured or cannot cover the cost of commercial coinsurance amounts through seagen secure 
estimated contributions for commercial coinsurance are deducted from gross sales 
these contributions are based on an analysis of expected plan utilization 
these estimates are adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience 
collaboration and license agreement revenues we use a time based proportional performance model to recognize revenue over our performance obligation period and adopted asu entitled multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force in under this standard  payments received by us are recognized as revenue over the performance period of the collaboration 
collaboration and license agreements are evaluated to determine whether the multiple elements and associated deliverables can be considered separate units of accounting 
to date  the deliverables under our collaboration and license agreements have not qualified as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  all amounts received or due  including any upfront payments  maintenance fees  milestone payments and reimbursement payments  are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation periods of each agreement  which range from two to fourteen years for our current agreements 
following the completion of the performance obligation period  such amounts received or due will be recognized as revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured 
the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time  or period of time  that revenue should be recognized 
our collaboration and license agreements include contractual milestones 
generally  the milestone events contained in our collaboration and license agreements coincide with the progression of the collaborators product candidates from development  to regulatory approval and then to commercialization and fall into the following categories 
development milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events designation of the suitability of a product candidate or initiation of preclinical studies 
our collaborators must undertake significant preclinical research and studies to make a determination of a product candidate and the time from those studies or designation to initiation of a clinical trial may take several years 
initiation of a phase i clinical trial 
generally  phase i clinical trials may take one to two years to complete 

table of contents initiation or completion of a phase ii clinical trial 
generally  phase ii clinical trials may take one to three years to complete 
initiation or completion of a phase iii clinical trial 
generally  phase iii clinical trials may take two to six years to complete 
regulatory milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events filing of regulatory applications for marketing approval such as a biologics license application in the united states or a marketing authorization application in europe 
generally  it may take up to twelve months to prepare and submit regulatory filings 
receiving marketing approval in a major market  such as in the united states  europe or japan 
generally it may take up to three years after a marketing application is submitted to obtain full approval for marketing and pricing from the applicable regulatory agency 
commercialization milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events first commercial sale in a particular market  such as in the united states or europe 
product sales in excess of a pre specified threshold 
the amount of time to achieve this type of milestone depends on several factors  including  but not limited to  the dollar amount of the threshold  the pricing of the product  market penetration of the product and the rate at which customers begin using the product 
our proprietary adc technology is the basis of our adc collaborations that we have entered into in the ordinary course of our business with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
under our adc collaboration agreements  we grant our collaborators research and commercial licenses to our technology and provide technology transfer services  technical advice  supplies and services for time periods ranging from two to fourteen years 
our adc collaborators are solely responsible for the development of their product candidates and the achievement of a milestone in any of the categories identified above is based solely on the collaborators efforts 
in the case of our other collaboration and license agreements  such as our adcetris collaboration with millennium or our co development agreement with agensys  our proprietary products or product candidates may be covered by the collaboration or we may be involved in certain development activities  however  the achievement of milestone events under these agreements is based on activities undertaken by the collaborator 
the process of successfully developing a product candidate  obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing a product candidate is highly uncertain and the attainment of any milestones is therefore uncertain and difficult to predict 
in addition  since we do not take a substantive role or control the research  development or commercialization of any products generated by our adc collaborators  we are not able to reasonably estimate when  if at all  any milestone payments or royalties may be payable to us by our adc collaborators 
as such  the milestone payments we may receive from our adc collaborators involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received 
similarly  even in those collaborations where we may have an active role in the development of the product candidate  such as our adcetris collaboration with millennium  the attainment of a milestone is based on the collaborator s activities and is generally outside our direction and control 
we generally invoice our collaborators on a monthly or quarterly basis  or upon completion of the effort or achievement of a milestone  based on the terms of each agreement 
amounts due  but not billed to a collaborator  if any  are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred revenue arises from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process and is recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability 

table of contents royalty revenues and cost of royalty revenues royalty revenues reflect amounts earned under the adcetris collaboration with millennium 
royalties are based on a percentage of millennium s net sales in its territory at rates that range from the mid teens to the mid twenties based on sales volume 
millennium bears a portion of third party royalty costs owed on sales of adcetris in its territory 
this amount is included in royalty revenue in our consolidated financial statements 
cost of royalty revenues reflects amounts owed to our third party licensors related to the sale of adcetris in millennium s territory 
royalty amounts on sales of adcetris in millennium s territory are recognized in the quarter in which millennium reports its sales activity to us  which is the quarter following the related sales 
investments 
we have investments in debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at estimated fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in investment and other income loss  net 
the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
we estimate fair values in accordance with a hierarchy prescribed by gaap 
this hierarchy prioritizes the inputs and assumptions used  and the valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
accrued liabilities 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued liabilities 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued liabilities include fees due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials  fees due in conjunction with manufacturing adcetris and our product candidates  third party royalties that accrue on our sales of adcetris and professional service fees  among other items 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual liabilities would differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with gaap 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries  benefits and other headcount related costs of our research and development staff  preclinical activities  clinical trials  lab supplies  drug manufacturing costs for our product candidates  and for adcetris when used in research and clinical trials  contract and outside service fees and facilities and overhead expenses 
research and development activities are expensed as incurred 
technology in licensing fees  including milestones and maintenance fees  and other costs to acquire technologies for product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval that are utilized in research and development and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
clinical trial expenses are a significant component of research and development expenses  and include investigator fees  site costs  clinical research organization costs  and costs to other third party vendors for central laboratory testing and data management 
costs associated with activities performed under research and development co development collaborations are reflected in research and development expense 
non refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
share based compensation 
we expense the fair value of share based payment transactions in our consolidated financial statements 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of 
table of contents options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management  including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
we also make decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
we charge this estimated fair value to expense over the vesting period of the arrangement using the graded vesting attribution method 
the fair value of each restricted stock unit  or rsu  equals the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
rsus granted to date vest on either the two year or three year anniversary of the grant date 
we therefore amortize the value of rsus  net of estimated forfeitures  to expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
we began issuing rsus in and in  we increased the relative weighting of rsus as a component of total stock awards 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be realized 
we believe that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as we have a history of net operating losses 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  a portion of which would increase income or decrease losses in the period in which such a determination was made 
inventories 
we consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain 
accordingly  we charge manufacturing costs to research and development expense until such time as a product has received regulatory approval for commercial sale 
we began capitalizing adcetris production costs into inventory following its accelerated approval by the fda in august production costs for our other product candidates continue to be charged to research and development expense 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined on a specific identification basis 
inventory includes the cost of materials  third party contract manufacturing and overhead associated with the production of adcetris 
we would write down inventory cost to net realizable value if we were to determine that we had any excess  obsolete or unsalable inventory 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  accrued expenses  research and development  share based compensation  income taxes and inventories 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
results of operations years ended december   and net product sales we began selling adcetris following its accelerated approval by the fda in august our net product sales increased to million in compared to million in our net sales include product sold in canada through a special access program  or sap  that allows physicians to request access on a limited basis to drugs that are not yet available for sale in canada 

table of contents we record product sales net of estimated government mandated rebates and chargebacks  distribution fees  product returns and other deductions 
these are generally referred to as gross to net deductions 
gross to net deductions  net of related payments and credits  are summarized as follows december  december  rebates chargebacks distribution fees  product returns and other total rebates chargebacks distribution fees  product returns and other total balance  beginning of year provision related to current year sales adjustments for prior period sales payments credits for current year sales payments credits for prior year sales balance  end of year deductions from gross sales increased in compared to as a result of the timing of government discount programs becoming effective 
we expect fluctuations in future gross to net discounts primarily as a result of the amount of government mandated discounts and rebates 
collaboration and license agreement revenues collaboration and license agreement revenues reflect amounts earned under product collaborations and adc collaboration and co development agreements 
these revenues reflect the earned portion of payments received by us including technology access and maintenance fees  milestone payments and reimbursement payments for research and development support we provide to our collaborators 
the increase in collaboration revenues from to primarily reflects amounts earned under our collaborations with millennium and abbvie 
collaboration and license agreement revenues during from genentech were primarily comprised of revenues earned under our dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech that ended in june we continue to have an adc collaboration with genentech 
collaboration and license agreement revenues are summarized by collaborator as follows collaboration and license agreement revenues by collaborator in thousands annual percentage change millennium abbvie genentech agensys other total our revenues are impacted by the term and duration of our collaboration and co development agreements and by progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and reimbursement of materials and support services as our collaborators advance their adc product candidates through the development process 
revenues may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates  the level of support we provide to our collaborators  specifically to millennium under our adcetris collaboration  the timing of milestones achieved  and our ability to enter into additional collaboration and co development agreements 
we expect our collaboration and license agreement revenues to increase in compared to  primarily as a result of our adcetris collaboration with millennium and our expanded relationship with abbvie 
we have a significant balance of deferred revenue  representing prior payments from our collaborators that have not yet been recognized as revenue 
this deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in future periods using a time based approach as we fulfill our performance obligations 

table of contents product collaboration agreements millennium adcetris and adc collaborations revenues earned under our adcetris and adc collaborations with millennium represented of our collaboration and license agreement revenues in  in and in revenues from millennium increased in and from prior year amounts primarily as a result of amounts earned under the adcetris collaboration  particularly as a result of the earned portion of net development cost reimbursements and milestone payments associated with the european union s conditional marketing authorization of adcetris in under the adcetris collaboration  we are entitled to receive progress and sales dependent milestone payments based on millennium s achievement of certain events related to adcetris for which millennium is responsible and development funding equal to of joint development costs 
we are also entitled to tiered royalties at percentages starting in the mid teens and escalating to the mid twenties based on net sales of adcetris within millennium s licensed territories 
millennium also bears a portion of third party royalty costs owed on sales of adcetris in its territory 
total future potential milestone payments to us under the adcetris collaboration could total approximately million 
of the remaining amount  up to approximately million relates to the achievement of development milestones  up to approximately million relates to the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to approximately million relates to the achievement of commercial milestones 
in  we received a million milestone payment as a result of the acceptance of millennium s marketing authorization application  or maa  by the european medicines agency  or ema 
in october  we received two milestone payments totaling million resulting from the european union s conditional marketing authorization of adcetris 
we recognize as collaboration revenue the million upfront collaboration payment  milestone payments and net development cost reimbursement payments to us over the ten year development period of the collaboration 
we receive reimbursement funding from millennium equal to one half of the cost of joint development activities that are performed by us under the collaboration 
to the extent that millennium performs development activities under the collaboration  our development cost reimbursement payments from millennium are reduced by half of those costs 
genentech we have an adc collaboration with genentech and  in  we also had a product collaboration with genentech 
the decrease in genentech collaboration revenues after resulted from the termination of the product collaboration 
amounts earned under our collaborations with genentech accounted for  and of our collaboration and license agreement revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the revenues increased from as a result of the earned portion of milestones received in collaboration and co development agreement with agensys we have entered into an agreement with agensys to jointly research  develop and commercialize adcs for cancer 
under this collaboration and co development agreement  agensys is conducting preclinical studies aimed at identifying adc product candidates for multiple designated antigens 
we are currently co developing asg me and asg me  and we have the right to exercise a co development option for one additional adc product candidate upon agensys submission of an investigational new drug application  or ind  to the fda 
agensys has the right to develop and commercialize the other adc product candidates on its own  subject to paying us fees  milestones  royalties and support fees for research and development services and material provided under the agreement 
either party may opt out of co development and profit sharing in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party 
amounts received for product candidates being developed solely by agensys will be recognized as revenue over the performance obligation period of the collaboration agreement using a time based approach 
revenues attributable to the agensys agreement increased in and from prior year amounts due to payments made to exercise additional exclusive licenses for adc product candidates 

table of contents other adc collaboration agreements we have other active adc collaborations with a number of companies to allow them to use our proprietary adc technology 
under our adc collaborations  which we enter into in the ordinary course of business  we receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments  progress dependent milestones and royalties on net sales of products incorporating our adc technology  as well as annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements 
these amounts are recognized over the performance obligation period of the agreements during which we provide limited support to the collaborator 
as of december   our adc collaborations had generated over million  primarily in the form of upfront payments 
total milestone payments to us under our current adc collaborations could approximate up to billion if all potential product candidates achieved all of the milestone events under all of our current adc collaborations 
of this amount  approximately billion relates to the achievement of development milestones  approximately billion relates to the achievement of regulatory milestones and approximately billion relates to the achievement of commercial milestones 
our adc collaborators are responsible for development  manufacturing and commercialization of any adc product candidates that result from the collaborations and are solely responsible for the achievement of any of the potential milestones under these collaborations 
since we do not control the research  development or commercialization of any products generated by our adc collaborators  we are not able to reasonably estimate when  if at all  any milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our adc collaborators 
in addition  our current adc collaborations are at early stages of development 
successfully developing a product candidate  obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure 
in addition  business combinations  changes in an adc collaborator s business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result in an adc collaborator abandoning or delaying development of its adc product candidates 
as such  the milestone payments associated with our adc collaborations involve a substantial degree of risk to achieve and may never be received 
accordingly  we do not expect  and investors should not assume  that we will receive all of the potential milestone payments provided for under our adc collaborations and it is possible that we may never receive any significant milestone payments under our adc collaborations 
abbvie revenues for reflect the earned portion of a million upfront payment related to an adc collaboration entered into in october  and an million upfront payment  milestone payments  and reimbursable support we provided to abbvie under an earlier adc collaboration agreement that we entered into in march royalty revenues and cost of royalty revenues royalty revenues recognized in relate to adcetris sales by millennium under its international named patient program 
cost of royalty revenues reflects amounts owed to our third party licensors related to millennium s sale of adcetris in its territory 
in october  millennium received conditional marketing authorization from the european commission for adcetris in two indications 
millennium began commercial launch of adcetris in the european union in the fourth quarter of we expect that royalty revenues and cost of royalty revenues will increase in as a result of this european commission approval and commercial sales of adcetris by millennium 
cost of sales adcetris cost of sales includes manufacturing costs of product sold  third party royalty costs  amortization of technology license costs and distribution and other costs 
we began capitalizing adcetris manufacturing costs as inventory following the accelerated approval by the fda in august the cost of product manufactured prior to fda approval was expensed as research and development expense as incurred and was combined with other research and development expenses 
while we track the quantities of individual adcetris product lots  we did not track pre fda approval manufacturing costs in our inventory system and therefore the manufacturing cost of adcetris produced prior to fda approval is not reasonably determinable 
most of the product produced prior to fda approval is expected to be available for us to use commercially 
we expect that our cost of sales as a percentage of sales will increase in future periods as product manufactured prior 
table of contents to fda approval  and therefore fully expensed  is consumed 
this cost benefit will vary based on when the components of the specific drug lots sold were produced and is expected to continue to some extent for at least the next twelve months  however  the time period over which this reduced cost inventory is consumed will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of future adcetris sales  the ultimate use of this inventory in either commercial sales  clinical development or other research activities  and the ability to utilize inventory prior to its expiration date 
we expect  as this reduced cost inventory is used  the percentage of total costs of sales for sales of adcetris will increase into the low to mid teens 
research and development our research and development expenses are summarized as follows research and development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical share based compensation expense total research and development expenses research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses and technology access fees associated with the discovery and identification of new monoclonal antibodies and related technologies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and cell killing agents for our adc technology 
research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates  such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies 
the decrease in research expenses during was due primarily to the timing of technology access fees 
development and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and pre approval manufacturing of drug product for use in research and our clinical trials 
development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities  and storage and shipment services of our product candidates  including adcetris prior to its approval by the fda in august the decrease in development and contract manufacturing expenses resulted primarily from lower adcetris manufacturing costs which were expensed to research and development expense prior to fda approval in august and capitalized as inventory thereafter 
the increase was primarily due to activity related to our sgn cda product candidate as well as higher compensation costs related to an increase in staffing levels 
clinical expenses include personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs including clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges  contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials  including ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies 
the increase in clinical expenses reflects costs for pre clinical toxicity studies related to our sgn cda and sgn liva product candidates as well as costs to develop a companion diagnostic test for identifying cd positive malignancies that might respond to treatment with adcetris 
clinical expenses in increased as we expanded the scope of clinical activities for our adcetris program 
in addition  compensation costs increased in both and as a result of increased staffing levels 
share based compensation expense reflects the non cash charge associated with stock options  restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the related arrangement 
the increases in share based compensation expense for and were primarily due to a higher average value per share for our more recent equity grants primarily attributable to an increase in our stock price 

table of contents we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development projects as well as our discovery and research programs directed towards identifying monoclonal antibodies and new classes of stable linkers and cell killing agents for our adc program 
we track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning 
we do not account for actual costs on a project by project basis as it relates to our infrastructure  facility  employee and other indirect costs 
we do  however  separately track significant third party costs including clinical trial costs  manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project by project basis 
the following table shows expenses incurred for research  contract manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical and regulatory services provided by third parties as well as milestone payments for in licensed technology for each of our product candidates

we began capitalizing adcetris production costs as inventory following accelerated approval of adcetris by the fda in august however  adcetris inventory that is deployed into clinical  research or development use is charged to research and development expense when it is no longer available for commercial use 
third party costs for adcetris decreased in from  primarily due to lower technology access fees partially offset by higher clinical trials costs 
third party costs for sgn cda and sgn liva increased significantly in from as we initiated contract manufacturing campaigns in in anticipation of planned ind submissions to the fda in in preparation for potential clinical trials 
in june  we exercised an option under our agreement with agensys to co develop asg me 
in addition to the payment of an option fee  we now co fund fifty percent of the development costs of this program 
costs in also included an opt in fee 
third party costs for sgn cda decreased in from primarily as a result of the timing of contract manufacturing and other activities in preparation for an ind that was submitted to the fda earlier in and preparation for clinical trials that began in third party costs for sgn cda increased in from primarily as a result of higher ind enabling activities incurred in in preparation for our clinical trials 

table of contents third party costs for asg me decreased in from primarily as a result of higher manufacturing and clinical trial costs in third party costs for asg me increased in from primarily as a result of the costs of two phase i clinical trials initiated during third party costs for sgn decreased in compared to as a result of higher manufacturing and clinical trial costs in third party costs for sgn decreased by in compared to as a result of lower manufacturing costs 
other costs and overhead include costs associated with personnel and facilities 
these costs increased in and in  primarily reflecting an increase in staffing levels in our development and clinical groups from the comparable prior year periods 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization  the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete 
the length of time varies substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients required in our clinical trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the number and location of sites included in the trials  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
reports of adverse events or safety concerns involving adcetris and our product candidates could interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of adcetris and our product candidates  including the adcetris post approval confirmatory studies that are required as a condition to our regulatory approvals 
our strategy has included entering into collaborations with third parties 
in these situations  the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate and the estimated completion date are largely under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
we anticipate that our total research and development expenses in will increase compared to due to increased clinical trial expenses for adcetris related to additional studies to evaluate other potential uses of adcetris  some of which are post approval commitment trials  and as a result of amounts incurred to continue the development of our adc product candidates 
certain adcetris development activities  including some clinical studies  will be conducted by millennium  the costs of which will not be reflected in our research and development expenses 
because of these and other factors  expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors  including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any 
table of contents degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of adcetris in any additional indications or of any of our product candidates 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative in thousands annual percentage change selling  general and administrative  excluding share based compensation expense share based compensation expense total selling  general and administrative expenses the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding share based compensation expense reflects the costs incurred by our commercial organization which was established during and was in place for the entire period 
share based compensation expense reflects the non cash charge associated with stock options  restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the related share based payment 
the increases in share based compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses were attributable to a higher weighted average grant date fair value of our more recent share based awards due to an increase in our stock price during the periods 
the increase in also reflects a larger number of optioned shares subject to expense recognition as a result of our increased staffing level 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in as we continue our commercial activities in support of the commercialization of adcetris 
investment and other income loss  net investment and other income loss  net in thousands total in  investment and other income loss  net totaled million which reflects a recovery from a former investment advisor in settlement of claims against the advisor concerning our previous holdings in auction rate securities 
the net investment loss in reflects an million realized loss related to an other than temporary impairment in the value of our auction rate securities 
liquidity and capital resources december  selected balance sheet and cashflow data in thousands cash  cash equivalents and investments working capital stockholders equity years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents we have financed the majority of our operations through the issuance of equity securities  by amounts received pursuant to product collaborations  our adc collaborations and  more recently  through collections from commercial sales of adcetris 
to a lesser degree  we have also financed our operations through royalty revenues and interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
these financing sources have historically allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in was primarily due to collections from commercial sales of adcetris and amounts generated from product collaborations and adc licensing activities 
in  the increase was due primarily to proceeds from the sale of common stock and amounts generated from product collaborations and adc licensing activities 
the reduction of cash used in operating activities in as compared to reflects a reduction in our net loss  cash collected from sales of adcetris and amounts received from our product and adc collaborations 
we generated cash from our operating activities in primarily due to an upfront payment received pursuant to our adcetris product collaboration 
financing activities reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan and  in  proceeds from an underwritten public offering of common stock 
investing activities primarily reflect the investment of cash and sales and maturities of those investments 
we have structured our investment portfolio to provide working capital as needed to fund our operations 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of non interest bearing bank accounts and interest bearing instruments subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in us government and agency securities  corporate securities  taxable municipal bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts 
our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs 
however  if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term  or investments do not pay at maturity  we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities  which may result in a loss 
as of december   we had million held in cash reserves or debt securities scheduled to mature within the next twelve months 
at our currently planned spending rate we believe that our financial resources  together with product and royalty revenues from sales of adcetris and the fees  milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to receive under our existing collaboration and license agreements  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner  such as increased development  manufacturing and clinical trial expenses in connection with required post approval studies and additional studies to potentially expand the use of adcetris or to advance our other adc pipeline programs 
further  in the event of a termination of the adcetris collaboration agreement with millennium  we would not receive development cost sharing payments  nor would we receive milestone payments or royalties for the development or sale of adcetris in millennium s territories 
any of these factors could lead to a need for us to raise additional capital 
we are required to conduct additional confirmatory phase iii post approval studies of adcetris as part of our regulatory approvals 
these are large studies that will be conducted over a lengthy period of time and although we have commenced these studies  based on the expected length of these studies and the inherent uncertainty of clinical trial costs  we may be required to raise additional capital in order to complete the studies 
in this regard  whether we have sufficient funding to complete these studies will be partially dependent upon cash received from sales of adcetris  which may not be sufficient to complete these studies 
our inability to obtain funds sufficient to complete these studies and establish confirmatory evidence of efficacy for adcetris may have material adverse consequences to us  including the loss of marketing approval for adcetris 
these required post approval studies will also significantly increase our clinical trial expenses  which could increase our losses and or negatively impact our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 
we expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees and support our preclinical development  manufacturing and clinical trial 
table of contents activities  including the post approval studies we must conduct for adcetris  as well as position adcetris for potential additional regulatory approvals  and we may therefore need to raise significant amounts of additional capital 
we may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements and public or private debt or equity financings 
we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
we anticipate that our adcetris net sales will be in the range of million to million in we anticipate that our revenues from collaboration and license agreements will be in the range of million to million in and will be generated from fees  milestones and reimbursements earned through our adcetris and adc collaborations 
research and development expenses are expected to be in the range of million to million in selling  general and administration expenses are expected to be in the range of million to million in operating expenses will be directed primarily towards commercialization and clinical trials of adcetris  development and clinical activities for sgn  asg me  asg me and sgn cda  and ind enabling activities for sgn cda and sgn liva 
cost of sales is expected to be approximately million in  representing a range of percent to percent of anticipated net sales 
non cash expenses are expected to be approximately million in  primarily attributable to share based compensation expense 
these estimates are forward looking information that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties described in this annual report on form k under the heading item a risk factors  and represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
accordingly  these estimates are necessarily subject to change 
commitments the following table reflects our future minimum contractual commitments as of december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases tenant improvements manufacturing  license collaboration agreements total we have entered into leases for our office and laboratory facilities expiring in that contain rate escalations and options for us to extend the leases 
one of these leases includes an early termination option 
operating lease obligations in the table above do not assume the exercise by us of any termination or extension options 
a substantial portion of the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements represents contractual obligations related to manufacturing our product candidates for use in our clinical trials and for commercial operations in the case of adcetris 
some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones 
some of our licensing agreements obligate us to pay a royalty on net sales of products utilizing licensed technology 
such royalties are dependent on future product sales and are not provided for in the table above as they are not estimable 
the above table also excludes up to approximately million in potential future milestone payments to third parties under license and collaboration agreements for adcetris and our other later stage development programs  which generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  clinical  regulatory and or 
table of contents commercial milestones 
milestone payments under these agreements through december  have totaled million 
these contingent payments have not been included in the above table and will not be included until the event triggering such payment or obligation has occurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board completed an accounting standards update entitled asu  intangibles goodwill and other that revises the requirements around how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment 
the guidance will allow entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount  a quantitative calculation would not be needed 
we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we currently have holdings in us treasury securities 
our investment securities consisted of the following in thousands december  short term investments we have estimated the effect on our investment portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates by one percent to be a reduction of million in the fair value of our investments as of december  in addition  a hypothetical decrease of in the effective yield of our investments would reduce our expected investment income by less than million over the next twelve months based on our investment balance at december  foreign currency risk most of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date 
we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the year ended december   primarily related to contract manufacturing and ex us clinical trial activities  and we expect to continue to do so 
our primary exposure is to fluctuations in the euro and british pound 
we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations 
however  transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations internationally 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date  however  we may do so in the future
