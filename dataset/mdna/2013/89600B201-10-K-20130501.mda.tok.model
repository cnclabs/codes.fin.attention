overview we are an independent energy company focused on the exploration  acquisition  and production of unconventional shale oil and natural gas resources in the united states 
our oil and natural gas reserves and operations are primarily concentrated in the bakken shale and three forks formations of the williston basin in north dakota and montana 
as of january   we held leasehold interests in approximately  net acres primarily in mckenzie and williams counties of north dakota and roosevelt and sheridan counties of montana 
having identified an area of focus in the bakken shale and three forks formations that we believe will generate attractive returns on invested capital  we are continuing to explore further opportunities in the region 
in our core area of north dakota and eastern montana  triangle is directing resources toward its operated program to develop its approximately  net acres  primarily in mckenzie and williams county  north dakota 
in roosevelt county  montana  our station prospect is a largely contiguous position within the thermally mature area of the williston basin 
our approximate  net acre position in the station prospect is predominantly operated acreage with an average remaining lease term of four years and provides us with a development area that we believe is scalable for the future 
with a focus on establishing an efficient operated development program  we have pursued select vertical integration opportunities in an effort to realize cost savings and strategic advantages 
the williston basin is a resource constrained region in terms of oilfield services  infrastructure and human capital  resulting in challenging operating conditions for relatively smaller operators  such as triangle 
pressuring pumping services and fluid logistics are critical to achieving operational efficiencies in the basin and represent material cost centers for exploration and production companies 
as a result  we have targeted these verticals for integration via rockpile and caliber 
having control over these areas of the value chain permits us to direct the availability and timing of well completion services and to transport oilfield fluids through pipeline 
rockpile  a wholly owned subsidiary initially capitalized in september and october  is a provider of hydraulic pressure pumping and complementary well completion services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the williston basin of north dakota and montana 
the williston basin is widely regarded as one of the most demanding basins in north america due to the harsh environment  lack of established infrastructure  and limited availability of qualified personnel in the region 
rockpile s management team has extensive experience providing oilfield services in the williston basin 
pressure pumping involves the use of a technologically sophisticated set of mobile equipment mounted on tractor trailer chassis 
rockpile purchased its first set of equipment  collectively known as a spread  in the first half of rockpile s first spread commenced hour operations in july and hour operations in september from commencement of operations in july through january   rockpile completed stages on wells for triangle and stages on wells for third parties for a total of stages on wells 
rockpile ordered a second spread during the first quarter of fiscal year  which is currently on schedule to be placed into production in the second quarter of fiscal year caliber is a joint venture with first reserve energy infrastructure fund freif created in october  which was capitalized through initial funding commitments of million in equity capital contributions million from freif  million from triangle 
caliber is managed and governed by its general partner  caliber midstream gp  llc  of which freif and triangle each own a non economic interest and share governance equally 
caliber is an energy infrastructure company that provides crude oil and natural gas gathering  transportation  treating and processing  produced water transportation and disposal in caliber owned and or operated injection wells  and freshwater sourcing and transportation by pipeline linked to various points of supply to 
table of contents producers in the williston basin of north dakota and montana 
we believe that caliber s integrated solution to water  oil and natural gas transportation and processing benefits producers by reducing the costs and environmental impacts of trucking and reducing or eliminating the emissions generated by flaring produced natural gas 
caliber began water transportation and disposal operations in january and expects to have all business lines in service by the third quarter of fiscal year caliber is currently constructing its phase pipeline system and central facility in mckenzie county  north dakota and plans to expand the phase pipeline system in mckenzie county and to build new infrastructure in other counties of north dakota and montana as needed by tusa and third party customers 
proved reserves fiscal year proved reserves grew to  mboe  up from  mboe at fiscal year end proved reserves were developed at fiscal year end compared to at fiscal year end reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled  boe 
in total  reserve additions were comprised of oil and natural gas 
all of our proved reserves are located in the bakken shale and three forks formations in north dakota or in montana close to the north dakota border 
the process of estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
significant decisions are required in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history  contractual arrangements and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that our reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
see note unaudited supplemental oil and natural gas disclosures to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report for further discussion regarding our proved reserves 
results of operations for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million per common share  basic and diluted as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million per common share  basic and diluted for the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents oil and natural gas sales and production costs for each year are summarized in the table that follows 
the fiscal year information shows oil sales volumes that correspond to the  in oil revenues for fiscal year us oil and natural gas operations oil sold barrels average oil price per barrel oil revenue natural gas sold mcf average natural gas price per mcf natural gas revenue natural gas liquids sold gallons average natural gas liquids price per gallon natural gas liquids revenue total oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues less production taxes less lease operating expense excluding production taxes less gathering  transportation and processing expense less impairment of oil and natural gas properties less oil and natural gas amortization expense less accretion of asset retirement obligations income loss from us oil and natural gas production gross profit from pressure pumping services other revenues income loss from us operations canadian oil and natural gas operations lease operating expense less impairment of oil and natural gas properties accretion of asset retirement obligations loss from canadian oil and natural gas operations income loss from operations us and canadian other income expense loss on derivative activities other income expense interest expense foreign exchange loss less depreciation of furniture and equipment less general and administrative expenses net loss total us barrels of oil equivalent boe sold us oil and natural gas revenue per boe sold us production tax per boe sold us other lease operating expense per boe sold us gathering  transportation and processing expense per boe sold us amortization expense per boe sold oil and natural gas sales revenue production revenues increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million for the fiscal year ended january  due to a increase in production volumes  offset by a reduction in oil and natural gas prices on a per boe basis 
the increase in production volumes added approximately 
table of contents million in revenues  and the decrease in price per boe reduced revenues by approximately million 
total production volumes increased to mboe  boepd for the fiscal year ended january  from mboe boepd for the fiscal year ended january   primarily due to the addition of approximately mboe from our operated drilling program as well as a mboe increase in production from our non operated portfolio 
additional information concerning production is in the following table fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  oil natural gas liquids total oil natural gas liquids total mbbls mmcf mgal mboe mbbls mmcf mgal mboe operated non operated total pressure pumping services rockpile commenced operations in july we formed rockpile with strategic objectives to have both greater control over our largest cost center as well as to provide locally sourced  high quality completion services to triangle and other operators in the williston basin 
rockpile s focus from formation through january  has mostly been on procuring new pressure pumping equipment  building physical and supply chain infrastructure in north dakota  recruiting and training employees  and establishing third party customers in the williston basin 
results of operations are affected by a number of variables including drilling and stimulation activity in the williston basin  pricing environment  service performance  equipment utilization  and the ability to secure and retain third party customers 
rockpile s profitability is primarily driven by the ability to obtain third party work  equipment utilization  and the pricing environment for our services 
for the year ended january   rockpile performed hydraulic fracturing services for triangle and three distinct third party customers 
this work resulted in total well completions for triangle and five for third parties 
all triangle wells were completed using plug and perf applications 
four third party wells were completed using a sliding sleeve application and one well was completed using a plug and perf application 
rockpile revenue is comprised of service revenue  which is what we charge for equipment and labor  and materials revenue  which is what we charge for chemicals and proppant 
pressure pumping direct costs include the cost of chemicals and proppant  labor wages and benefits  trucking charges  material transloading fees  railroad related costs  insurance  repairs and maintenance charges and safety costs 
direct costs as a percentage of revenue will vary based upon equipment utilization 
the  of gross profit from pressure pumping services in fiscal year ended is after i elimination of million in intercompany gross profit and ii full cost accounting non recognition of million of income relating to pressure pumping services for third parties through october  for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  there was no additional non recognition of service income under full cost accounting because the eliminated intercompany gross profit on pressure pumping for each tusa operated well exceeded that well s total service income  due to tusa s high working interests averaging in operated wells completed in that quarter 
see note segment reporting in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and see full cost accounting s non recognition of service income with third parties in certain circumstances that begins on page hedging activities in fiscal year  the company entered into commodity derivative instruments  primarily utilizing single day puts and costless collars to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil production 
the company s commodity derivative instruments are measured at fair value and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as derivative assets and liabilities 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded based on the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments 
both the unrealized and realized gains and losses resulting from the contract settlement of derivatives are recorded in the gain loss on derivative activities line on the consolidated statement of operations 
we value our derivative instruments by obtaining independent market quotes  as well as using industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  risk free interest rates  and estimated volatility factors  as well as other relevant economic measures 

table of contents the discount rate used in the fair values of these instruments includes a measure of nonperformance risk by the counterparty or us  as appropriate 
we utilize our valuations to assess the reasonableness of counterparties valuations 
the consideration of the factors results in an estimated exit price for each derivative asset or liability under a market place participant s view 
management believes that this approach provides a reasonable  non biased  verifiable  and consistent methodology for valuing commodity derivative instruments 
the change in fair value of our derivative instruments resulted in a million unrealized loss on derivative activities for fiscal year for additional discussion  please refer to note commodity derivative instruments under item of this annual report 
production taxes total production taxes increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  from for the fiscal year ended january  production taxes are primarily based on the wellhead values of production and the increase in production taxes is directly related to a increase in production revenues 
production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were for the fiscal year ended january  and for the fiscal year ended january  these rates are consistent with the published production tax rates in north dakota  the primary source of our production 
lease operating expense lease operating expense for us operations loe decreased to per boe for the fiscal year ended january  from per boe for the fiscal year ended january  the decrease is primarily the result of lower loe on non operated wells which decreased from per boe to per boe 
for most of our non operated wells the largest loe component is water disposal 
an increase in availability of trucking and third party disposal facilities in the williston basin has reduced this cost on a per unit basis 
offsetting the reduction in non operated loe costs were operated loe costs of per boe 
included in the operated loe rate are non recurring costs for equipment rentals as well as two workovers 
gathering  transportation and processing gathering  transportation and processing gtp expenses increased to per boe for the fiscal year ended january  from per boe for the fiscal year ended january  currently  all gtp costs are associated with non operated wells and are primarily for the gathering and transportation of oil and natural gas 
gtp costs were and per non operated boe for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
this increase is primarily the result of an increase in natural gas being gathered and transported instead of being flared 
going forward we expect gtp costs to increase as natural gas gathering  transportation and processing infrastructure becomes available for operated wells during the second half of fiscal year depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion dd a expense oil and natural gas amortization expense increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  from million for the fiscal year ended january  the increase is primarily related to a increase in production for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in production accounted for an additional million in dd a expense  which was offset by a reduction of million due to a decreased dd a rate 
the decrease in the amortization rate is due to proved reserves increasing at a higher rate than the amortization base increased 
during fiscal year proved reserves increased approximately while the amortization base increased approximately 
depreciation expense increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  from 
million for the fiscal year ended january  this increase is primarily attributable to the depreciation of rockpile operating equipment as the equipment was placed into service in july 
table of contents general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes increases in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years compared with the increases are primarily due to increases in the number of employees as we continued to expand our acquisition  exploration  development and production activities in north dakota and montana during fiscal year increase decrease general and administrative  excluding rockpile stock based compensation salaries  benefits and consulting fees office rent and other office costs professional fees public company costs rockpile general and administrative expense total general and administrative expense rockpile s general and administrative costs of million increased from million in fiscal year this increase is primarily attributable to increased compensation and benefit costs for personnel in rockpile s headquarters and field offices as rockpile built its team and commenced operations in july interest expense the million in interest expense consists of approximately million in interest and amortized fees related to the tusa credit facility and approximately million in accrued interest and amortized fees related to our convertible note with ngp 
the total million in interest expense is reduced by approximately million of capitalized interest which is generally incurred as exploratory wells are drilled and completed 
see note long term debt for additional information regarding our credit facility and convertible note 
income taxes our fiscal year provision for deferred income taxes is zero due to recognition of valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets of million and million at january  and  respectively 
if facts and circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized in the future  then the valuation allowance would be correspondingly reduced and a deferred tax benefit recognized 
results of operations for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million per common share  basic and diluted as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million per common share  basic and diluted for the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents oil and natural gas sales and production costs for each year are summarized in the table that follows 
the fiscal year information shows oil sales volumes that correspond to the  in oil revenues for fiscal year us oil and natural gas operations oil sold barrels average oil price per barrel oil revenue natural gas sold mcf average natural gas price per mcf natural gas revenue natural gas liquids sold gallons average natural gas liquids price per gallon natural gas liquids revenue total oil and natural gas revenues less production taxes less lease operating expense excluding production taxes less gathering  transportation and processing expense less impairment of oil and natural gas properties less oil and natural gas amortization expense less accretion of asset retirement obligations income loss from us oil and natural gas production canadian oil and natural gas operations lease operating expense impairment of oil and natural gas properties gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties accretion of asset retirement obligations loss from canadian oil and natural gas operations loss from operations us and canadian other income expense other income expense foreign exchange gain loss less depreciation of furniture and equipment less general and administrative expenses net loss total us barrels of oil equivalent boe sold us oil and natural gas revenue per boe sold us production tax per boe sold us other lease operating expense per boe sold us gathering  transportation and processing expense per boe sold us amortization expense per boe sold 
table of contents oil and natural gas operations for fiscal year  we had total oil and natural gas revenues of million compared with million for fiscal year in fiscal year  our oil sales averaged boe per day 
our oil sales volume increased to  barrels in fiscal year  as compared to  barrels in fiscal year due to ongoing bakken shale exploration and development activities 
these increases are primarily due to net wells commencing production in fiscal year for our non operated wells  natural gas is typically flared or used at the wellsite due to i newness of the well  ii lack of local natural gas distribution systems  iii more north dakota natural gas production than the available north dakota natural gas processing facilities can process and iv low prices for natural gas 
most of our natural gas sales in fiscal year were for wet natural gas sold before processing to extract natural gas liquids from the wet natural gas 
most of our natural gas sales in fiscal year were for dry natural gas after extraction of natural gas liquids 
hence  the average natural gas sales price was higher in fiscal year than in fiscal year impairment of oil and natural gas properties during fiscal years and  we recorded impairments of million and million  respectively  in connection with our properties in the maritimes basin of nova scotia 
we assess all unproved property for possible impairment annually or upon a triggering event 
the assessment includes consideration of factors  among others  such as the intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  governmental restrictions and the assignment of proved reserves 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million ceiling test impairment expense of the capitalized costs of our us oil and natural gas properties 
the ceiling reflected the proved reserves at january  estimated by ryder scott 
because all of our production in fiscal year was relatively new  from relatively small working interests in non operated wells many of which do not offset older wells that are similarly completed  it was relatively difficult and sometimes impossible to timely obtain from the operators adequate information on the wells to understand variations in well costs  operating costs and production patterns to support as reasonably certain at january  future production that was expected 
despite the thousands of wells that have been drilled in recent years in the bakken formation in north dakota  the proved ie  reasonably certain reserves for a new well or for a proved undeveloped location are largely dependent on the production history of the new well or the well s immediately offsetting the new well or the undeveloped location 
in such an environment of limited well and production information  estimations should be lower as to how much future production from a given well is proved 
a secondary factor contributing to the impairment was poor results from a small area on the southern edge of our acreage position in mckenzie county  north dakota 
we had participated in three wells to test that area  but their disappointing fiscal year production history relative to the three wells high capital and operating costs led to the removal in the fall of of proved reserves from eight undeveloped locations that had million in pv value at january 
table of contents general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes increases in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year compared with the increases are primarily due to significant increases in the number of employees employees on january  and by january  as we greatly expanded our acquisition  exploration  development and production activities in north dakota and montana in fiscal year compared with fiscal year increase decrease stock based compensation salaries  benefits and consulting fees office rent and other office costs professional fees public company costs rockpile general and administrative expense total general and administrative expense stock based compensation expense increased approximately million primarily because we had additional employees who received grants of restricted stock units in fiscal year as compared to the same period in fiscal year  and because we delayed recognition of certain share based compensation expense until stockholder approval on july  of our omnibus incentive plan 
income taxes our fiscal year provision for deferred income taxes is zero due to recognition of valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets of million and million at january  and  respectively 
if facts and circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized in the future  then the valuation allowance would be correspondingly reduced and a deferred tax benefit recognized 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is highly dependent on the commodity price we receive for the oil and natural gas we produce 
commodity prices are market driven  and have been volatile  therefore  we cannot predict future commodity prices 
prices received for production heavily influence our revenue  cash flow  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
our primary cash requirements in our exploration and production segment are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
based on current prices  we anticipate capital requirements for fiscal year to be approximately million 
these funds will be allocated primarily towards our operated drilling program 
sources of capital cash flow from operations 
we expect our cash flow from operations to continue to increase commensurate with our anticipated increase in sales volumes and wells drilled 
we have been able to significantly increase our volumes over the past year  which is directly related to our successful drilling and completion of operated wells 
if we are able to continue to drill and complete our wells as anticipated and they produce at rates similar to those generated by our existing wells  subject to the changes in the market price of crude oil  we would expect our production rates and operating cash flows to continue to increase as we continue to develop our properties 
we also expect cash flow from operations at rockpile and caliber to increase as they expand their operations 
tusa credit facility 
as of january   the maximum credit available under the tusa credit facility was million with a borrowing base and aggregate commitments of million 
as of january   we had available capacity under the credit facility of million 
on april   tusa amended its credit facility to increase the maximum credit available to million with a current borrowing base of million 
the 
table of contents ability to maintain and increase this facility and borrow additional funds is dependent on a number of variables  including our proved reserves  and assumptions regarding the price at which oil and natural gas can be sold 
further  we expect that our borrowing base will increase with the addition of proved properties resulting from our ongoing drilling and completion activities 
we are subject to restrictive covenants under the credit facility 
for further details on our credit facility refer to note long term debt under item in this annual report 
rockpile credit facility 
on february   rockpile  entered into a credit and security agreement the rockpile credit agreement by and between rockpile  as borrower  and wells fargo bank  national association  as lender the lender 
the rockpile credit agreement provides for a  revolving loan facility  a  equipment term loan facility and a  capex term loan facility 
borrowings under the rockpile credit agreement are available to i provide for the working capital and general corporate requirements of rockpile  ii purchase equipment  iii pay any fees and expenses in connection with the rockpile credit agreement  and iv support letters of credit 
as of february   the full  of the equipment term loan was drawn and was outstanding  and there were no revolving borrowings  letters of credit  or capex term loans outstanding under the agreement 
the borrowing base is supported by eligible accounts receivable and inventory and is re determined periodically when a borrowing base certificate is filed with the lender 
the maturity date of the credit agreement is february   unless sooner terminated as provided in the credit agreement 
we are subject to restrictive covenants under this credit facility 
for further details on the rockpile credit agreement refer to note subsequent events 
common equity private placement 
in march  the company sold to two affiliates of ngp triangle holdings  llc  shares of common stock of the company in a private placement at per share for aggregate consideration of million 
capital requirements outlook in addition to the common equity private placement  we are dependent on our anticipated cash flows from operations and the expected borrowing availability under the tusa credit facility and the rockpile credit agreement to fund our fiscal year capital expenditures budget and other contractual commitments refer to note long term debt and note commitments and contingencies under item in this annual report for further details 
while we expect such sources of capital to be sufficient for such purposes  there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated future cash flows from operations  that credit will be available under our credit facilities when needed  or that we would be able to complete alternative transactions in the capital markets  if needed 
our ability to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms is dependent on a number of factors  many of which we cannot control  including changes in our credit rating  interest rates  market perceptions of us and the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry and tax burdens due to new tax laws 
if our existing and potential sources of liquidity are not sufficient to satisfy such commitments and to undertake our currently planned expenditures  we believe that we have the flexibility in our commitments to alter our drilling program 
if we were not successful in obtaining sufficient funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  we would be required to curtail our planned expenditures or restructure our operations by way of reducing our rig count which may result in termination fees depending on the timing and requirements of the underlying agreements  we would be unable to implement our original exploration and drilling program  and we may be unable to service our debt obligation or satisfy our contractual obligations 
convertible note in july  the company sold a convertible promissory note with an initial principal amount of  the convertible note to ngp 
the net proceeds from the convertible note were primarily used to finance fiscal year drilling and completion projects 
the convertible note does not have a stated maturity 
following the fifth anniversary of the closing  if the price of the company s common stock exceeds per share and certain trading volume requirements are met  the company can elect to redeem all but not less than all of the convertible note at a price equal to the outstanding principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  payable  at the company s option  in cash or common stock 
following the eighth anniversary of the closing  the company can elect to redeem all but not less than all of the convertible note at a price equal to the principal plus accrued and unpaid interest  payable in cash 
further  following either the tenth anniversary of the closing or a change of control of the company  the holders of the convertible note will have the right to require the company to redeem the convertible note at a price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  with an additional make whole payment for 
table of contents scheduled interest payments remaining if such right is exercised prior to the fifth anniversary of closing 
for further details regarding the convertible note  refer to note long term debt under item in this annual report 
working capital as part of our cash management strategy  we frequently use available funds to reduce any balance on the tusa credit facility 
accordingly  we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances 
our working capital was million at january   as compared to million at january  registered offerings historically  we have financed our operations  property acquisitions and other capital investments from the proceeds of offerings of our equity and debt securities 
we currently have on file with the sec two effective shelf registration statements to allow us to offer up to million and approximately million of securities in the future  respectively 
under the registration statements  we may offer from time to time debt securities  common stock  warrants and other securities or any combination of such securities in amounts  prices and on terms announced when and if the securities are offered 
the specifics of any future offerings  along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered  will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement at the time of any such offering 
derivative instruments we utilize various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs 
currently  we utilize single day puts and costless collars 
current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity  since we are either paying cash to  or receiving cash from  our counterparties 
if actual commodity prices are higher than the fixed or ceiling prices in our derivative instruments  our cash flows will be lower than if we had no derivative instruments 
conversely  if actual commodity prices are lower than the fixed or floor prices in our derivative instruments  our cash flows will be higher than if we had no derivative instruments 
net cash used by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  cash flows used in operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher oil revenues driven by higher sales volumes  partially offset by increases in production expenses  production taxes  general and administrative expenses  and other expenses associated with the growth of our operations during the year 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal year  investing activities used million in cash compared to million in fiscal year the increase in cash flows used in investing activities in fiscal year was primarily due to our larger capital budget and drilling program which used million and the capital costs incurred for the start up of rockpile which used million 
the use of cash for capital expenditures was partially offset by proceeds of million received from dispositions of non strategic assets during the year 
in addition to capital expenditures  we had a million increase in cash used for the investment in caliber and a million increase in cash used for the purchase of derivative contracts 
net cash provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended january  totaled million 
the cash in flow was primarily a result of proceeds from the million convertible note and proceeds from the tusa credit facility see note long term debt 
research and development as an exploration and production natural resource company  we do not normally engage in research and development r d 
there were no r d activities or expenditures made in the last three fiscal years

f as of january   rockpile had various commitments for future expenditures relating to i leases of land  rail spur  rail cars and tractor trailer units  ii transloading services and track rental and iii an agreement relating to the use of technology and equipment for transportation  transloading and storage of bulk commodities 
g on october   tusa entered into two midstream services agreements with caliber north dakota llc  one for crude oil gathering  stabilization  treating and redelivery and one for i natural gas compression  gathering  dehydration  processing and redelivery  ii produced water transportation and disposal services  and iii fresh water transportation for tusa s oil and natural gas drilling and production operations 
under the agreements  tusa committed to deliver minimum monthly revenues derived from the fees paid by tusa to caliber for volumes of oil  natural gas  produced water  and fresh water for a primary term of years beginning on the in service date of the caliber facilities the date on which the caliber central facility has been substantially completed and has commenced commercial operation  estimated to occur between july  and september  
the total revenue commitment over the year term is  received interchangeably across all four classes of service 

table of contents as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  the company may at times have commitments in place to reserve or earn certain acreage positions or wells 
if the company does not meet such commitments  the acreage positions or wells may be lost 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results  future results of operations will be affected 
full cost accounting method we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  internal costs directly related to exploration and development activities  and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration  and development activities  are also capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  no gain or loss is recognized upon the disposition of oil and natural gas properties unless such disposition would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
companies that follow the full cost accounting method are required to make quarterly ceiling test calculations on country wide cost pools 
this test limits total capitalized costs for oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a and deferred income taxes to the sum of the present value discounted at per annum of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  the cost of properties not being amortized  the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized  and all related tax effects 
revenue calculations in the reserves are based on the unweighted average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months 
changes in proved reserve estimates whether based upon quantity revisions or commodity prices will cause corresponding changes to the full cost ceiling limitation 
if net capitalized costs subject to amortization exceed this limit  the excess would be charged to expense 
any recorded impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
amortization of proved oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method  whereby capitalized costs  including future development costs and asset retirement obligations  are amortized over total estimated proved reserves 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties  including those in connection with wells in progress  are excluded from the costs being amortized 
we do not have major development projects that are excluded from costs being amortized 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate excluded costs for inclusion in the costs to be amortized resulting from the determination of proved reserves or impairments 
to the extent that the evaluation indicates these properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to production expense in the period incurred 
full cost accounting s non recognition of service income with third parties in certain circumstances both the successful efforts accounting method and the full cost accounting method require the elimination of revenue  cost of sales and gross profit for intercompany transactions in consolidated financial statements 
hence  upon consolidation  triangle eliminates rockpile s revenues  costs of sales and gross profit on a well to the extent of triangle s working interest in the well 
unlike the successful efforts accounting method  the full cost accounting method also restricts or eliminates recognition of service income with third parties in certain circumstances 
the full cost accounting method s rule 
table of contents c iv c is to be broadly applied whereby triangle may recognize no pressure pumping services income on behalf of third parties  as well as triangle  with regard to a well operated by triangle or a triangle affiliate 
if triangle or a triangle affiliate is the well s operator  then no income earned on rockpile pressure pumping services for the well may be currently recognized in triangle s financial statements  regardless of how much economic interest triangle may have in that well 
such income is credited to triangle s capitalized well costs and indirectly recognized later through a lower amortization rate as proved reserves are produced 
such income is pressure pumping revenue in excess of related expenses in providing pressure pumping services  including the portion of rockpile general and administrative expenses i identifiable with those pressure pumping services and ii incurred in the period of service 
where triangle or a triangle affiliate is not the well operator  the full cost accounting method s rule c iv a restricts recognition of consolidated service income such as pressure pumping for a well to such income that exceeds triangle s share of costs incurred and estimated to be incurred in connection with the drilling and completion of the well  for triangle s related property interests acquired within the twelve month period preceding engagement for the service 
as a simplified example  if rockpile provides pressure pumping services on a well not operated by triangle  but in which triangle has a recently acquired working interest for which triangle s share of well cost are  after elimination of consolidated intercompany profit  then triangle cannot recognize the first  of other pressure pumping income on the well 
to the extent income cannot be currently recognized  triangle charges such service income against service revenue and credits the well s capitalized costs 
the deferred income is indirectly recognized later through a lower amortization rate as proved reserves are produced 
asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
oil and natural gas producing companies incur this liability in connection with costs related to the plugging of wells  the removal of facilities and equipment and site restorations upon acquiring or drilling a successful well 
subsequent to initial measurement  the asset retirement liability is required to be accreted each period 
capitalized costs are depleted as a component of the full cost pool 
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves we use the units of production method to amortize over proved reserves the cost of our oil and natural gas properties 
changes in our estimates of proved reserve quantities will cause corresponding changes in amortization expense for the revision period and for periods thereafter as the reserves are produced 
in some cases  a reduction in reserve estimates will lead to a full cost ceiling limitation charge in the period of the revision 
the process of estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and judgments in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and varying economic conditions  particularly as to the economic viability of proved undeveloped reserves in light of upfront development costs 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
at january   of our total proved reserves are categorized as proved undeveloped 
all of these proved undeveloped reserves are in the bakken shale formation or three forks formation in north dakota 
our internal senior reservoir engineer reviews our reserve estimates at least quarterly and revises our proved reserve estimates  as significant new information becomes available 
derivative instruments the company has entered into commodity derivative instruments  primarily utilizing single day puts or costless collars to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil production 
the company s commodity derivative instruments are measured at fair value and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as derivative assets and liabilities 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded based on the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments 
both the unrealized and realized gains and losses resulting from the contract settlement of derivatives are recorded in the gain loss on derivatives line on the consolidated statement of operations 
we value our derivative instruments by obtaining independent market quotes  as well as using industry standard models that 
table of contents consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  risk free interest rates  and estimated volatility factors  as well as other relevant economic measures 
the discount rate used in the fair values of these instruments includes a measure of nonperformance risk by the counterparty or us  as appropriate 
we utilize our valuations to assess the reasonableness of counterparties valuations 
the consideration of the factors results in an estimated exit price for each derivative asset or liability under a market place participant s view 
management believes that this approach provides a reasonable  non biased  verifiable  and consistent methodology for valuing commodity derivative instruments 
for additional discussion  please refer to note commodity derivative instruments under item of this annual report 
income taxes income taxes are recognized based on earnings reported for tax return purposes in addition to a provision for deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are accounted for using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying the enacted statutory tax rates in effect at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the company s financial statements 
the effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some portion of the benefit from deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company s uncertain tax positions must meet a more likely than not realization threshold to be recognized  and any potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized within income tax expense 
we assess quarterly the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as historical performance and future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
stock based compensation triangle recognizes compensation related to all equity based awards in the consolidated financial statements based on their estimated grant date fair value 
we grant various types of equity based awards including restricted stock units and stock options at triangle  and restricted units at rockpile series b units 
the fair value of stock option and series b unit awards is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
service based restricted stock units are valued using the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
compensation cost is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
see note stock based compensation for additional information regarding our stock based compensation 
revenue recognition all revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is complete or the equipment has been delivered to the customer  the amount is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured  as follows oil and natural gas revenue 
the company recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil and natural gas using the sales method of accounting 
revenues from the sale of crude oil and natural gas are recognized when the product is delivered at a fixed or determinable price  title has transferred  and collectability is reasonably assured and evidenced by a contract 
pressure pumping revenue 
the company enters into arrangements with its customers to provide hydraulic fracturing services  which can be either on a spot market basis or under term contracts 
we only enter into arrangements with customers for which we believe that collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized and customers are invoiced upon the completion of each job  which generally consists of numerous fracturing stages 
once a job has been completed to the customer s satisfaction  a field ticket is written that includes charges for the service performed and the chemicals and proppants consumed during the course of the service 
the field ticket also includes charges for the mobilization of the equipment to the location  additional equipment used on the job  if any  and other miscellaneous consumables 
rates for services performed on a spot market basis are based on agreed upon market rates 
with respect to services performed under term contracts  customers are invoiced a monthly mandatory payment as defined in the contract  whether or not those services are actually utilized 
to the 
table of contents extent customers utilize more than the contracted minimum  they are invoiced for such excess at rates defined in the contract 
as of january   the company has not entered into any pressure pumping term contracts with third parties 
intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  and under certain circumstances  service revenue is reduced when service income cannot be recognized under full cost accounting as explained earlier in this section on critical accounting policies 
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note summary of significant accounting policies of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our primary market risk is market changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the market prices for oil and natural gas have been highly volatile and are likely to continue to be highly volatile in the future  which will impact our prospective revenues from the sale of products or properties 
currently  we use single day puts and costless collars to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil production 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
all hedges are accounted for using mark to market accounting 
we use costless collars to establish floor and ceiling prices on our anticipated future oil production 
we neither receive nor pay net premiums when we enter into these arrangements 
these contracts are settled monthly 
when the settlement price the market price for oil or natural gas on the settlement date for a period is above the ceiling price  we pay our counterparty 
when the settlement price for a period is below the floor price  our counterparty is required to pay us 
we have used single day puts as a hedge against caliber revenue commitments 
we paid a cash premium for these contracts which are settled on a single day in the future 
if the oil price is below the strike price on the date of settlement  we receive a cash settlement 
if the oil price is above the strike price on the date of settlement  nothing is owed by the company to the counterparty 
the use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
tusa is currently a party to derivative contracts with one counterparty 
the company has a netting arrangement with the counterparty that provides for the offset of payables against receivables from separate derivative arrangements with the counterparty in the event of contract termination 
although the instruments are valued using indices published by established exchanges  the instruments are traded directly with the counterparty 
the derivative contracts may be terminated by a non defaulting party in the event of default by one of the parties to the agreement 
the objective of the company s use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and natural gas prices and to manage its exposure to commodity price risk 
while the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  these instruments may also limit the company s ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
the company may  from time to time  add incremental derivatives to hedge additional production  restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of the company s existing positions 
the company s commodity derivative contracts as of march  are summarized below contract type basis quantity strike price term or end date collar nymex bopd february  december  collar nymex boepd february  september  collar nymex boepd february  september  collar nymex bopd february  december  collar nymex bopd february  december  collar nymex bopd january  december  collar nymex bopd january  december  put nymex  bbl june  put nymex  bbl june  put nymex  bbl june  put nymex  bbl december  put nymex  bbl december  put nymex  bbl december  nymex refers to quoted prices on the new york mercantile exchange 
table of contents we determine the estimated fair value of derivative instruments using a market approach based on several factors  including quoted market prices in active markets  quotes from third parties  the credit rating of each counterparty  and the company s own credit rating 
the company also performs an internal valuation to ensure the reasonableness of third party quotes 
in consideration of counterparty credit risk  the company assessed the possibility of whether the counterparty to the derivative would default by failing to make any contractually required payments 
additionally  the company considers that it is of substantial credit quality and has the financial resources and willingness to meet its potential repayment obligations associated with the derivative transactions 
changes in commodity futures price strips during the fiscal year ended january  had an overall net negative impact on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
for the fiscal year ended january   we reported an unrealized non cash mark to market loss on derivative contracts of million 
the fair value of our derivative instruments at january  was a net asset of million 
this mark to market net asset relates to derivative instruments with various terms that are scheduled to be realized over the period from january through december over this period  actual realized derivative settlements may differ significantly  either positively or negatively  from the unrealized mark to market valuation at january  an assumed increase of in the forward commodity prices used in the year end valuation of our derivative instruments would result in a net derivative liability of approximately million at january  conversely  an assumed decrease of in forward commodity prices would result in a net derivative asset of approximately million at january  for further details regarding our derivative contracts please refer to note commodity derivative instruments under item in this annual report 
interest rate risk at january   we had  outstanding under the convertible note  all of which has a fixed interest rate of 
in addition  as of january   we had million available to us under the tusa credit facility  of which  million was drawn at year end 
the credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
assuming we had the maximum amount outstanding at january  under the tusa credit facility of million  a increase in interest rates would result in additional annualized interest expense of  for a detailed discussion of the foregoing credit arrangements  including a discussion of the applicable interest rates  please refer to note long term debt under item in this annual report
