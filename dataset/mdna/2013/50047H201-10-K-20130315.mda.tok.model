item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we own and operate restaurants located in states 
we offer freshly prepared food  attentive service  and a contemporary ambiance that create a satisfying yet affordable dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants with which we compete 
our high volume upscale casual restaurants feature a diverse selection of mainstream american favorites as well as a variety of appetizers and entrees with an international influence  including an extensive selection of sushi items 
our menu items are freshly prepared and incorporate over signature sauces and dressings that we make from scratch  creating broad based appeal for the lifestyle and taste trends of a diverse group of guests 
we believe that our diverse menu and generous portions  combined with an average check of approximately per guest  offers our guests an attractive price value proposition 
the restaurant industry is significantly affected by changes in economic conditions  discretionary spending patterns  consumer confidence  and other factors 
customer traffic and sales patterns have shown improvement since to date as evidenced by our positive comparable restaurant sales for the previous nine quarters 
for  our comparable restaurant sales grew from prior year  improving on same store sales that had shown growth in we believe continued improvement in consumer confidence and spending in general  will be important and necessary catalysts to drive guest traffic and higher guest check averages in casual dining restaurants in general and our restaurants in particular 
we closed our west palm beach  florida and sugar land  texas restaurants during the third quarter of we settled all lease termination costs for the west palm beach and sugar land locations in the third quarter of and  respectively 
the decision to close these restaurants was based on these restaurants past operating performance 
the closures enable us to focus on our existing restaurant portfolio while also allowing us to concentrate on developing new restaurants 
as a result of the restaurant closures  all historical operating results as well as lease termination and exit costs attributable to these restaurants are reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss for all periods presented 
during  we continued to focus on growing sales while remaining disciplined with our costs 
the average unit volume of our comparable base restaurants was million  or per square foot compared to million  or per square foot in our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as guests discover our concept and we generate market awareness 
despite a very challenging and uncertain economic environment  our average unit volumes grew over during even with a modest year over year sales growth  we generated restaurant operating profit of million in  an increase of compared to million in prior year 
restaurant operating profit as a percentage of sales increased to relative to in we experience various patterns in our operating cost structure 
cost of sales  labor  and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least months generally trend consistent with restaurant sales  and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will take approximately six months to achieve operating efficiencies as a result of challenges typically associated with opening new restaurants  including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees  as well as other factors 
we expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant  but to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient in operating that unit 
occupancy and a portion of restaurant operating expenses are fixed 
as a result  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses measured as a percentage of restaurant sales 
the majority of our general and administrative costs are fixed costs 
we expect our general and administrative spending to generally decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as we leverage these investments and realize the benefits of higher sales volumes 
in  our general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or  compared to million in prior year 
however  we expect general and administrative costs to increase in as we are making investments in real estate development  construction and operations to support our growth objectives 
we opened our last restaurant in october since that time  we have focused on increasing sales  improving restaurant level operating margins and investing in infrastructure for future growth 
at the same time  we have engaged in a rigorous site evaluation process to identify sites for new restaurant openings in and beyond 
in december  we signed a lease for  square feet at the village at meridian  a lifestyle development in the boise  idaho metropolitan area 
we currently expect to open this location and another location in the fourth quarter of therefore  we expect to incur significant preopening expense during  while revenues from the new restaurants  if opened in that time frame  would likely not be significant prior to accordingly  we would expect the opening of these units to place downward pressure on our profitability in although the actual preopening expenses depend upon numerous factors  historically  our cash preopening expenses approximates  per location  and non cash rent expense typically ranges from  to  per location 
key measures we use to evaluate our company key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following number of restaurant openings 
number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period 
same store sales percentage change 
same store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
in calculating the percentage change in same store sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
same store sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount 
menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount 
as of december   and  there were  and restaurants  respectively  included in the comparable restaurant base 
average weekly sales 
average weekly sales represents the average of restaurant sales measured over consecutive monday through sunday time periods 
average unit volume 
average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
sales per square foot 
sales per square foot represents the restaurant sales for our comparable restaurant base  divided by the total leasable square feet for such restaurants 
restaurant operating profit 
restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  or preopening expenses 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance prior to application of corporate overhead 
we use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors 
this measure provides useful information regarding our financial condition and results of operations and allows investors to better determine future financial results driven by growth and to compare restaurant level profitability 
key financial definitions restaurant sales 
restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales  net of promotions and discounts 
cost of sales

we expense restaurant preopening expenses as incurred  and we expect preopening expenses to be similar for each new restaurant opening  which typically commence six to eight months prior to a restaurant opening 
our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened  the timing of new restaurant openings  the location of the restaurants  and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense consists of the depreciation of property and equipment 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net consists of interest earned on our cash and investments and any gains or losses on our investments

in calculating the percentage change for same store sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
includes only those restaurants in the comparable restaurant base 
restaurant operating profit is not a financial measurement determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles see reconciliation below and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to income loss from operations 
restaurant operating profit may not be comparable to the same or similarly titled measures computed by other companies 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance 
we use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors

cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales at for is comparable to the prior year period 
labor 
labor costs for our restaurants increased million  or  to million during compared to million in the increase was attributable to increased staffing to support the year over year sales growth during labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to compared to in  reflecting in part higher medical and worker compensation costs during the year 
occupancy 
occupancy expenses decreased million  or to million in from million in the lower occupancy expenses are primarily associated with an amendment in our lease agreement for one restaurant

restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating expenses decreased million or to million year over year on higher sales volume compared to million in lower marketing  credit card fees and utilities more than offset higher repair and maintenance costs and increased training  travel and recruiting expenses

insurance recoveries and other represent an insurance settlement for property and facility damage and for a business interruption claim  net of other non recurring items incurred 
we recognized a gain of  for business interruption and furniture replacement claims associated with a fire at our troy  michigan restaurant in we also recognized additional tax expense for a sales tax audit matter in provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of  and  respectively  during and the year over year increase in the provision is attributable to federal and state taxes on higher taxable income for the year partially offset by the utilization of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and an accrual reversal for uncertain tax position resulting from a lapse in the statute of limitation 
discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations of  and  in and  respectively  represents the historical operating results as well as lease termination and exit costs attributable to the two restaurants closed during the third quarter of in the third quarter of  we settled with the landlord of the sugar land location for  and recognized the incremental lease termination costs and related attorney fees 
see note to the unaudited consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  restaurant sales 
restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million in from million during the prior year  primarily attributable to an increase in comparable restaurant sales and million in incremental sales generated by our baltimore  maryland restaurant which opened in october the increase in comparable restaurant sales is attributable to a increase in guest traffic in  higher average guest check aided by new menu offerings  and an estimated effective menu price increase of approximately 
cost of sales

cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during the prior year period 
the slight increase in cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales during reflects an increase in year over year costs for certain dry goods  produce and dairy products  largely offset by cost savings from various purchasing and culinary initiatives as well as leverage from the menu price increase 
labor 
labor costs for our restaurants increased million  or  to million during from million during the prior year period 
the increase was primarily the result of the opening of the baltimore restaurant in october and increased staffing levels to support higher average weekly sales 
as a percentage of sales  labor costs decreased to during from during the decrease in labor costs as a percentage of restaurant sales is primarily due to our ability to leverage fixed management wages and hourly labor costs resulting from the increase in comparable restaurant sales 
occupancy 
occupancy expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million during the prior year period 
the increase in occupancy expenses is attributable to occupancy expenses associated with the baltimore restaurant that opened in october and an increase in percentage rent charges for certain locations based upon higher sales volumes  partially offset by rent reductions at certain locations  including a significant change in the lease provisions for one restaurant 
occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to during from during the decrease in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales primarily reflects increased leverage of the fixed portion of these costs from higher average sales and the rent reductions discussed above 
restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during compared to million during the prior year period 
the increase in restaurant operating expenses is attributable to the opening of the baltimore restaurant in october restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to during from in the prior year period as a result of lower advertising expenditures and increased leverage of fixed operating costs resulting from higher average weekly sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during from million during the prior year period 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to million in severance and related charges associated with the resignation of two executive officers  higher incentive compensation expense related to our improved financial performance  and the write off of costs associated with updating our design and d cor specifications 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to of restaurant sales during compared to of restaurant sales during the prior year period

we did not incur any preopening expense during as no new restaurants were opened during we incurred million in preopening expense during related to the baltimore restaurant that opened in october depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million during from million during the prior year period 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due to depreciation expense for one restaurant that opened in october depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to during from during the prior year period  reflecting leverage of these fixed costs from higher average sales volumes 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was essentially flat at  during compared to  during the prior year period 
the provision for reflects income taxes for certain states in which we operate that do not calculate tax based upon net income  partially offset by the reversal of tax accruals for unrecognized tax positions 
the provision for reflected state taxes  partially offset by the benefit of an anticipated refund of prior year taxes due to a change in tax legislation 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations represent the historical operating results as well as lease termination and exit costs attributable to two restaurants closed during the third quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the loss from discontinued operations was  during compared to  in potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the following timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  fluctuations in commodity and food protein prices  restaurant operating costs and preopening costs for our newly opened restaurants  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter  labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel  profitability of our restaurants  especially in new markets  increases and decreases in comparable restaurant sales  impairment of long lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures  changes in borrowings and interest rates  general economic conditions  weather conditions or natural disasters  timing of certain holidays  changes in government regulations  settlements  damages and legal costs associated with litigation  new or revised regulatory requirements and accounting pronouncements  and changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with our annual financial statements and related notes 
certain reclassifications of prior year s financial statement amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any subsequent quarter

similar to many restaurant companies  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
we are typically required to expend cash to perform site related work and to construct and equip each restaurant 
the average investment cost for our restaurants depends upon the type of lease entered into  the amount of tenant improvement allowance we receive from landlords  and whether we assume responsibility for the construction of the building 
we expect the cash investment cost of our typical restaurant to be approximately million  net of landlord tenant improvement allowances of between million and million  and excluding cash preopening expenses of approximately million 
we expect these costs will vary from one market to another based on real estate values  zoning regulations  permitting requirements  labor markets and other variables 
restaurants that are subject to ground leases and do not receive landlord tenant improvement allowances typically require a significantly higher cash investment 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
the following tables set forth  as of the dates and for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements amounts in thousands december  cash and short term investments net working capital deficit the working capital deficit at december  is primarily attributable to accruals for payroll and lease termination costs related to our two closed restaurants 
year ended december  cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of new restaurants and remodels  have historically been significant 
over the last several years  we funded development of new restaurants and remodels primarily from the proceeds of equity financing prior to and cash flows from operations 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of our current restaurants  the pace of expansion and remodel  real estate markets  site locations  the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and the credit market environment 
in december  we signed a lease for a new restaurant development in boise  idaho  a new market for us  which is currently expected to open in the fourth quarter of we currently expect to open two new restaurants  including the boise location  and to remodel certain existing locations in therefore we would expect a significant increase in capital expenditures in resulting from the construction and remodel of these restaurants 
our investment cost for new restaurants varies significantly  depending upon the length and type of lease entered into  the amount of tenant improvement allowance we receive from landlords  and whether we assume responsibility for the construction of the building 
we expect the cash investment cost of our prototype restaurant to be approximately million  net of landlord tenant improvement allowances of between million and million  and excluding cash preopening expenses of approximately million 
our current operations generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations and general and administrative costs 
we believe existing cash and short term investments of million  the ability to draw on our million credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund development of new restaurants and planned remodels of existing restaurants 
any reduction of our cash flow from operations may cause a delay or cancellation of future restaurant development or remodels of existing restaurants 
as of december   we had working capital of million  a million improvement from december  primarily as a result of higher earnings during compared to prior year 
our ability to generate higher cash flow from operations and cost containment efforts throughout have been instrumental in reducing the working capital deficit experienced in prior years 
financing to construct new restaurants for amounts in excess of the line of credit availability may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could impact our growth plans  financial condition  and results of operations 
additional equity financing may result in dilution to current stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations or financial covenants and ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
credit facility on february   we entered into loan agreements with stearns bank national association stearns for a term loan and a line of credit collectively  the loans 
the loans are secured by commercial security agreements executed by us and each of our subsidiaries granting the lender a security interest in all of the consolidated assets of the company 
we obtained a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of million the term loan 
the term loan matures on february  and requires monthly principal and interest payments of  interest on the term loan is calculated at the greater of over the wall street journal prime rate the index or per year 
proceeds of the term loan were used to pay off the remaining balance of our equipment loans and to pay expenses associated with the loans 
the outstanding balance on the term loan at december  was  we also obtained a credit line to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of million the credit line 
the final maturity date for all installments under the credit line is february  interest on the loans will initially be per year and will be adjusted each time the index changes and on each such date  the interest rate will equal the greater of the index plus or per year 
there is no non usage fee associated with the credit line 
borrowings under the credit line can be used for capital expenditures for existing and new restaurant units  provided that we match each disbursement dollar for dollar and the amount of any such disbursement could not exceed million per location 
on july   we amended certain terms of the credit line with stearns 
the amendment allows us to increase the aggregate principal amount under the credit line to million from million  under which we can borrow up to million at the greater of over the index or per year for our stock repurchase program 
the amendment also allows us to reduce the interest floor on the credit line from to per year on borrowings for restaurant remodeling and new construction projects 
we have not drawn any amounts to date under the credit line  and the entire million balance was available at december  fees incurred for the loans totaled  these fees are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet at december  and such fees are being amortized over the life of the loans 
the unamortized fees totaled  as of december  the loans also require us to comply with certain covenants  including a a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than  b a maximum interest bearing debt ebitda ratio of and c a debt to tangible net worth of equal or less than we were in compliance with such covenants at december  notes payable as of december   we had two equipment term loans with a lender  each collateralized by restaurant equipment 
the outstanding principal balance under these loans was  at december  the loans bore interest at rates ranging from to and required monthly principal and interest payments aggregating approximately  we utilized a portion of the term loan proceeds to pay off the loans in february stock repurchase and retirement program in november  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase and retirement program under which we were authorized to purchase up to million of common stock 
we completed the authorization in february  purchasing and retiring  shares 
in may  our board of directors authorized another stock repurchase and retirement program of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
as of december   we had spent million to purchase and retire  shares under the authorization 
the authorization of the program does not have an expiration date and it does not require us to purchase a specific dollar amount of shares 
this authorization may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time 
the timing and number of shares purchased pursuant to the share purchase authorization are subject to a number of factors  including current market conditions  legal constraints and available cash 
cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the past three years in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
our cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  provided million of net cash in compared to million in the year over year decrease is primarily the result of greater use of cash for accrued expenses  specifically  the settlement of our sugar land lease in the third quarter of and reduction in deferred rent partially offset by higher net income during the net increase of million in cash provided by operating activities during compared to is primarily the result of higher net income and an increase in accrued expenses partially offset by a reduction in deferred rent 
investing activities 
we fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodels primarily with cash and investments 
capital expenditures in were million  primarily attributable to remodeling costs and maintenance capital expenditures for existing restaurants and infrastructure investments at the corporate office 
during  capital expenditures were million and primarily consisted of contractor payments for our baltimore restaurant that opened during october and remodeling costs for existing restaurants 
capital expenditures for were million primarily attributable to the funding of construction for our baltimore restaurant and contractor payments for two restaurants that were opened during the second half of investing activities for also reflects the sale of million in auction rate securities and million in other investments 
we currently expect to open two new restaurants and to remodel certain existing locations in therefore  we would expect a significant increase in capital expenditures in resulting from the construction and remodel of these restaurants 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities during totaled million  consisting of million for the purchase and retirement of common stock under both our november and may stock repurchase programs and million debt repayment for our equipment loans and term loan 
we also paid million in fees in conjunction with the credit facility 
cash receipts from financing activities during consisted of million from term loan borrowings and million in proceeds from stock option and warrant exercises and employee stock plan purchases 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  reflecting million in shares purchased under our november stock repurchase program and million in principal payments on equipment loans  partially offset by million in proceeds associated with our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
net cash used in financing activities was million during reflecting the repayment of million in borrowings under a previous line of credit with ubs and million in principal payments on equipment loans 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term notes payable  including current portion interest on notes payable operating leases total the table above does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
we have evaluated and determined that we do not have any purchase obligations as defined in the sec final rule no 
 disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation  and we select useful lives that reflect the estimated economic lives of the underlying assets 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
we capitalize improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred 
we are often required to exercise judgment in our decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgment by management  which may produce different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
we evaluate property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in restaurant operating results indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes in laws and regulations  legal factors or in the business climate 
the assessment of impairment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
the recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if indicators of impairment are present and if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the restaurant assets  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on our assumptions 
we closed our west palm beach  florida and sugar land  texas restaurants during the third quarter of we recorded non cash asset impairment charges for these two locations along with four other underperforming restaurants in we continue to monitor the operating performance of each individual restaurant 
we may be required to record impairment charges in the future if certain restaurants perform below expectations 
leasing activities we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  we evaluate each property and classify the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
we exercise significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the future minimum lease payments 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which typically begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expensed during the rent holiday period 
we record contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales  which exceeds minimum base rent  over the periods the liability is incurred 
contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
these estimates consider  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of tax benefits of deductible temporary differences and operating loss or tax credit carryforwards will depend on whether we have sufficient taxable income within the carryback and carryforward periods permitted by the tax law to allow for utilization of the deductible amounts and carryforwards 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making this determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes 
stock based compensation we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of stock option awards  which requires the use of a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends  and expected term 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
we also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our expectation of future experience while considering our historical experience 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss 
we are also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms 
the recoverability of such assets are dependent upon the actual deduction that may be available at exercise and can further be impaired by either the expiration of the option or an overall valuation reserve on deferred tax assets 
we believe the estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the commodity markets 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposure is commodity costs 
many of the food products purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  international demand  and other factors outside our control 
substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices in response to food commodity price increases 
we may also face market risk exposure due to the variable interest rates on the term loan and credit line obtained from stearns bank 
interest on the loans are subject to adjustment based on changes to the wall street journal prime rate 
interest rate fluctuations may adversely impact our ability to service the loans
