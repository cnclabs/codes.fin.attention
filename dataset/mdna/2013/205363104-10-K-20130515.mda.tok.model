overview csc provides it and business process outsourcing  consulting  systems integration and other it services to its customers 
the company targets the delivery of these services within three broad lines of business or sectors north american public sector nps  managed services sector mss  and business solutions and services bss 
the company reportable segments are as follows the nps segment provides services to the us federal government and its agencies  civil departments and branches of the military  and operates principally within a regulatory environment subject to governmental contracting and accounting requirements  including federal acquisition regulations  cost accounting standards and audits by various us federal agencies 
the mss segment provides large scale infrastructure and application outsourcing solutions offerings as well as mid size services delivery to customers globally 
the bss segment provides industry specific consulting and systems integration services  business process outsourcing  and intellectual property based software solutions 
for additional information regarding our business segments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company was in the process of changing its operating model and realigning executive management accordingly 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company expects that it will commence operating under the new model and its operating and reportable segments will change to align with this new model 
economic and industry factors the company results of operations are impacted by economic conditions generally  including macroeconomic conditions 
we are monitoring current macroeconomic and credit market conditions and levels of business confidence and their potential effect on our clients and on us 
a severe and or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies in which we operate 
this may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and have a material adverse effect on our new contract bookings and results of operations 
particularly in light of recent economic uncertainty  we continue to monitor our costs closely in order to respond to changing conditions and to manage any impact to our results of operations 
our results of operations are also affected by levels of business activity and rates of change in the industries we serve  as well as by the pace of technological change and the type and level of technology spending by our clients 
the ability to identify and capitalize on these markets and technological changes early in their cycles is a key driver of our performance 
revenues are driven by our ability to secure new contracts and to deliver solutions and services that add value to our clients 
our ability to add value to clients  and therefore generate revenues  depends in part on our ability to deliver market leading service offerings and to deploy skilled teams of professionals quickly and on a global basis 
the bss and mss segment markets are affected by various economic and industry factors 
the economic environment in the regions csc serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on it projects 
csc is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors  including service offerings and flexibility 
management monitors industry factors including relative market shares  growth rates  billing rates  staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates  inflation rates and foreign currency rates 
outsourcing contracts are typically long term relationships 
long term  complex outsourcing contracts  including their consulting components  require ongoing review of the terms and scope of work in order to meet clients evolving business needs and performance expectations 
more recently  the company has rationalized its service offerings and implemented a strategy of selling defined solutions that require less customization and benefit from leveraged delivery at scale 
such solutions include our portfolio of cloud based infrastructure as a service offerings  managed applications services and a range of discrete offerings for computing  storage  mobility and networking services 
the nps segment market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics 
all us government contracts and subcontracts may be modified  curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change 
in the event that a contract is terminated for convenience  the company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed 
shifting priorities of the us government can also impact the future of projects 
management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts  legislative activity  budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations 
business drivers revenue in all three lines of business is generated by providing services on a variety of contract types lasting from less than six months to ten years or more 
factors affecting revenue include the company ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards  satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract recompetes  compete on services offered  delivery models offered  technical ability and innovation  quality  flexibility  global reach  experience  and results created  and identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues 
earnings are impacted by the above revenue factors and  in addition  the company ability to control costs  particularly labor costs  subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare  pension and general and administrative costs  anticipate talent needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses  accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals  develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore  and manage foreign currency fluctuations related to international operations 
cash flows are affected by the above earnings factors and  in addition  by the following factors timely management of receivables and payables  investment opportunities available  particularly related to business acquisitions  dispositions and large outsourcing contracts  tax obligations  and the ability to efficiently manage capital deployed for outsourcing contracts  software  and property  plant and equipment 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means  with the primary financial measures including new contract wins  revenue  operating margins  and free cash flow 
new contract wins in addition to being a primary driver of future revenue  new contract wins also provide management an assessment of the company ability to compete 
the total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new or recompeted contracts  as well as numerous external factors 
revenue revenue is a product of contracts won in prior periods  known as backlog  and work secured in the current year 
year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins  and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts 
foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue 
operating margins operating margins reflect the company performance on contracts and ability to control costs 
while the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of changes in the mix of businesses with different cost profiles  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability 
although the majority of the company costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues  increased use of offshore support also exposes csc to additional margin fluctuations 
free cash flow primary drivers of the company free cash flow are earnings provided by the company operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings 
also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances 
fiscal highlights the key operating results for fiscal include revenues decreased million  or  to  million compared to fiscal on a constant currency basis  revenues decreased million or 
operating income increased to million as compared to an operating loss of  million in fiscal the operating income margins increased to from in fiscal earnings before interest and taxes ebit increased to million as compared to a loss before interest and taxes of  million in fiscal the ebit margin increased to from in fiscal income from continuing operations before taxes was million  compared to a loss from continuing operations before taxes of  million in fiscal income from discontinued operations  net of taxes was million  compared to million in fiscal net income attributable to csc common shareholders was million  an increase from  million in the prior year

the company announced contract awards of billion  including mss segment awards of billion  nps segment awards of billion  and bss segment awards of billion 
total backlog at the end of fiscal was billion  a decrease of billion as compared to the backlog at the end of fiscal of billion 
of the total billion backlog  billion is expected to be realized as revenue in fiscal  and billion is not yet funded 
days sales outstanding dso was days at march   a change from days at march  debt to total capitalization ratio was at the end of fiscal  a decrease of percentage points from at the end of fiscal cash provided by operating activities was  million  as compared to  million during fiscal cash provided by investing activities was million  as compared to cash used of  million during fiscal cash used in financing activities was million  as compared to million during fiscal free cash flow was million  as compared to million in fiscal selected references are made on a constant currency basis so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates  thereby providing comparisons of operating performance from period to period 
financial results on a constant currency basis are calculated by translating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior period s currency conversion rates 
this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
operating income is a non us generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure used by management to assess performance of the company segments and on a consolidated basis 
the company s definition of such measure may differ from other companies 
we define operating income as revenue less costs of services  depreciation and amortization expense  and segment general and administrative g a expense  excluding corporate g a 
management compensates for the limitations of this non gaap measure by also reviewing income loss from continuing operations before taxes  which includes costs excluded from the operating income definition such as goodwill impairment  corporate g a  interest and other income 
a reconciliation of consolidated operating loss income to loss income from continuing operations before taxes is as follows twelve months ended amounts in millions march  march  april  operating loss income corporate g a interest expense interest income goodwill impairment other income  net income loss from continuing operations before taxes ebit is a non us gaap measure that provides useful information to investors regarding the company results of operations as it provides another measure of the company profitability  and is considered an important measure by financial analysts covering csc and its peers 
the company s definition of such measure may differ from other companies 
we define ebit as revenue less costs of services  selling  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  goodwill impairment  restructuring costs  and other income expense 
ebit margin is defined as ebit as a percentage of revenue 
a reconciliation of ebit to net income from continuing operations is as follows twelve months ended amounts in millions march  march  april  earnings loss before interest and taxes interest expense interest income taxes on income income loss from continuing operations backlog represents total estimated contract value of predominantly long term contracts  based on customer commitments that the company believes to be firm 
backlog value is based on contract commitments  management s judgment and assumptions about volume of services  availability of customer funding and other factors 
backlog estimates for government contracts include both the funded and unfunded portions and all of the option periods 
backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by factors including modifications of contracts and foreign currency movements 
csc backlog  for all periods presented  have been recast to exclude the backlog relating to discontinued operations 
for nps  announced award values for competitive indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity idiq awards represent the expected contract value at the time a task order is awarded under the contract 
announced values for non competitive idiq awards represent management s estimate at the award date 
business awards for mss are estimated at the time of contract signing based on then existing projections of service volumes and currency exchange rates  and include option years 
bss award values are based on firm commitments  with the exception of deals greater than million and contract terms greater than two years 
in those instances  bss estimates are based on projections of service volumes and currency exchange rates at the time of contract signing and include option years 
csc business awards  for all periods presented  have been recast to exclude the awards relating to discontinued operations 
dso is calculated as total receivables at the fiscal period end divided by revenue per day 
revenue per day equals total revenues divided by the number of days in the fiscal period 
total receivables includes unbilled receivables but excludes tax receivables and long term receivables 
debt to total capitalization ratio is defined as total current and long term debt divided by total debt and equity  including noncontrolling interest 
free cash flow is a non gaap measure and the company definition of such measure may differ from that used by other companies 
we define free cash flow as equal to the sum of operating cash flows  investing cash flows  excluding business acquisitions  dispositions and investments including short term investments and purchase or sale of available for sale securities and payments on capital leases and other long term asset financings 
csc s free cash flow measure does not distinguish operating cash flows from investing cash flows as they are required to be presented in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for operating and investing cash flows as determined in accordance with gaap 
free cash flow is one of the factors csc management uses in reviewing the overall performance of the business 
management compensates for the limitations of this non gaap measure by also reviewing the gaap measures of operating  investing and financing cash flows as well as debt levels measured by the debt to total capitalization ratio

the company fiscal revenue decreased million as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to reduction in net internal revenue of million  partially offset by favorable impact of foreign currency movement of million and million of revenue from acquisitions 
north american public sector the company s nps sector segment revenues were derived from the following sources twelve months ended march  march  april  dollars in millions amount percent change amount percent change amount department of defense civil agencies other total other revenues consist of foreign  state and local government work as well as commercial contracts performed by the nps segment 
fiscal nps segment revenue decreased million  or  as compared to fiscal this decline was due to decreases on both department of defense dod and civil agencies civil contracts  of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
the revenue decrease on dod contracts was comprised of reduced revenue of million on certain contracts with the us air force and other dod agencies that either had concluded or were winding down  and reduced revenue of million due to a net reduction in tasking on existing contracts  primarily with the us army and the us navy 
the year over year revenue trend  however  benefited from the fiscal adverse adjustment to revenue of million resulting from the settlement on a contract with the us army  which did not recur  and an increase in revenue of million from a wage determination settlement on a contract with the us air force  which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal the revenue decrease on contracts with civil was primarily due to a net reduction in scope and tasking on existing contracts of million  primarily on contracts with nasa and the us postal service  and reduced revenue of million due to the programs winding down or ending with the department of state  department of commerce  department of labor and the environmental protection agency epa  along with reduced revenue due to timing of certain contractual milestones of million 
these revenue decreases were partially offset by increased revenue of million on contracts with the department of state and department of homeland security dhs  which fully ramped up in fiscal nps revenue trend benefited million from adjustments recorded on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
fiscal had net favorable adjustments of million as compared to million of net adverse adjustments in fiscal nps won contracts of billion during fiscal compared to billion during fiscal these amounts included billion and billion of recompetes  respectively 
the decrease was due to two large awards that occurred in fiscal as previously reported  and reinforced by sequestration  nps federal government customers are becoming more cautious with contract awards and spending  resulting in shorter contract durations  smaller award values and an inclination towards extension of existing contracts 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
fiscal nps segment revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  as compared to fiscal this decrease was due to its dod contracts  which had a million  or  decrease 
partially offsetting the decline in revenue on dod contracts were increases in revenue from contracts with civil  which had a million  or  increase  and increases in revenue from other contracts  which had a million  or  increase 
fiscal nps revenue was adversely impacted by net million of adjustments on certain long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
of such adjustments  million reduced revenue and million increased revenue 
the decreases in revenue on dod contracts  primarily with the us army and the us air force  were due to a combination of completion of existing task orders  a contract termination and net reduction in scope and tasking on other existing contracts 
in addition  revenue was adversely impacted by the contract claims settlement with the us federal government in the second quarter of million see note to the consolidated financial statements and by a million adjustment on a contract with the us air force accounted for under the percentage of completion method due to a stop work order 
the increase in revenue from civil was primarily due to contracts with the dhs  the department of human and health services dhhs and the social security administration that commenced during the second half of fiscal these increases were partially offset by revenue that did not recur due to contract completions  primarily the us census support contract  as well as reduced scope on certain other contracts  primarily with the epa  department of transportation  department of energy and the internal revenue service 
the increase in revenue from other contracts was primarily due to higher revenue on a contract with a state agency for the development of a healthcare administration system 
the higher revenue on this contract was partially offset by a million adverse adjustment resulting from revised estimates under the percentage of completion accounting method 
of the million revenue reduction  million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal  many of our government customers continued to experience uncertainty about their fiscal budgets due to the budget control act of as a result  large program awards were delayed and customers shifted to smaller and shorter term contracts 
nps won new contracts of billion during fiscal as compared to billion during fiscal managed services sector fiscal mss segment revenue decreased million  or  as compared to fiscal in constant currency  revenue decreased million  or 
the unfavorable foreign currency impact was primarily due to the movement in the us dollar against the euro  the danish kroner  and the british pound 
mss fiscal acquisition of applabs resulted in an increase of revenue for the year of million  or of the revenue growth for fiscal excluding the impact of foreign currency and the acquisition  net internal revenue decreased million  or  as compared to the same period of fiscal the decrease in mss net internal revenue for fiscal of million was primarily due to reduced revenue of million from contracts that terminated or concluded and reduced revenue of million from existing contracts primarily due to price downs  contract modifications and lower pass through revenue 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased revenue from new client engagements acquired in late in fiscal and fiscal of million  favorable impact of a year over year change in revenue adjustments of million related to adjustments on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  and million of other fiscal favorable revenue adjustments relating primarily to contract settlements with certain customers 
included in the mss revenue change described above is a million year over year favorable impact of out of period adjustments 
mss fiscal revenue was adversely impacted by million of out of period adjustments where as the fiscal revenue was adversely impacted by million of out of period adjustments see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the mss had contract awards with a total value of billion compared to billion during fiscal these amounts included billion and billion of recompetes  respectively 
additionally  the decrease in awards was mainly due to the company being more selective in its bid and proposal activity  and the awards that were bid on being of shorter duration and  thus  lower total contract value 
prospectively  the company plans to focus on securing new business through greater cross selling between segments and targeting a greater number of market renewals 
fiscal mss segment revenue increased million  or  as compared to fiscal in constant currency  revenue decreased million  or 
the foreign currency impact was primarily due to the movement in the us dollar against the australian dollar  the british pound  the euro and the swiss franc 
mss second quarter acquisition of applabs see note to the consolidated financial statements provided revenue of million  or of the revenue growth 
excluding the impact of foreign currency effects and the acquisition  fiscal net internal revenue decreased million  or  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to net volume and scope reductions of approximately million and contract conclusions and terminations of approximately million  partially offset by revenue from new contracts of approximately million 
in addition  revenue was impacted by certain one time adjustments  including adverse adjustments on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of million and missed service level metrics of million due to delays on certain outsourcing contracts  partially offset by a favorable adjustment on termination of a contract of million 
the mss year over year revenue trend was also adversely impacted by out of period adjustments 
the out of period revenue decreases recorded in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  mss had contract awards with a total value of billion as compared to billion during fiscal business solutions services fiscal bss segment revenue increased million  or  as compared to fiscal in constant currency  revenue increased million or 
the twelve month revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by foreign currency movement in the us dollar of million  or  primarily against the euro  the brazilian real  the british pound and the australian dollar 
the acquisition of isoft and the other fiscal acquisitions provided million  or of the year over year revenue increase 
excluding the effect of foreign currency movements and acquisitions  bss fiscal revenue increased million  or  over the prior year 
the increase in bss net internal revenue includes the impact of the fiscal adverse revenue adjustment of million associated with the nhs contract charge  which did not recur in fiscal excluding the adverse nhs contract revenue charge  bss fiscal net internal revenue decreased million  or 
the decrease in bss net internal revenue for fiscal  excluding the impact of the adverse fiscal nhs revenue adjustment  was due to revenue decreases primarily in its professional technology staffing business in australia  in its financial services group  and in its healthcare group 
these revenue decreases were partially offset by revenue increases on contracts with the nhs 
the year over year revenue decrease from the australian staffing business was million 
this was due to a combination of a slowdown in its business  prior to its sale  from reduced demand from certain of its key customers  and its sale on january  the revenue decrease of million in the financial services group was due to lower license sales and services revenue in european markets 
the revenue decrease in the health services of million was due to a combination of lower revenue in the nordic and us markets 
the revenue increase relating to the nhs contract  excluding the fiscal write off  was primarily due to recording revenue from achieving a key milestone associated with the lorenzo care management software  deployment of the software at three nhs trust sites  and revenue indexation for fiscal bss revenue increase included million of favorable adjustments on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
fiscal revenue included favorable adjustments of million as compared to fiscal revenue that included adverse adjustments of million 
bss year over year revenue trend was also favorably impacted by million of out of period adjustments 
fiscal revenue included million of adverse out of period adjustments  whereas fiscal included million of adverse adjustments 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  bss had contract awards of billion compared to billion in fiscal the fiscal amount included billion of recompetes 
there were no recompete awards in fiscal fiscal bss segment revenue increased million  or  as compared to fiscal in constant currency  revenue decreased million  or 
the foreign currency impact was primarily due to the movement in the us dollar against the australian dollar  the british pound and the euro 
the acquisition of isoft and the other fiscal and fiscal acquisitions provided million  or  of the year over year revenue increase 
excluding the effect of foreign currency movements and acquisitions  bss fiscal revenue decreased million  or  compared to the prior year 
the lower net internal fiscal revenue was primarily due to a decrease in revenue on the nhs contract of million  which was adversely impacted by the third quarter million revenue write down see note to the consolidated financial statements and by fiscal milestone revenue of million that did not recur in fiscal bss health vertical also had reduced revenue due to continuing softness in the life sciences market and certain project completions in north america 
both of these revenue decreases were partially offset by revenue increases in the other verticals of bss consulting group 
the consulting group growth was primarily in north america  which offset revenue shortfalls in other regions 
the bss year over year revenue trend was also adversely impacted by out of period adjustments 
the out of period revenue adjustments recorded in fiscal and fiscal were revenue decreases of million and revenue increases of million  respectively see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  bss had contract awards of billion compared to billion in fiscal costs and expenses the company s total costs and expenses were as follows twelve months ended percentage of revenue dollars in millions march  march  april  costs of services excludes depreciation and amortization  specified contract charge  settlement charge and restructuring costs of and cost of services specified contract charge excludes amount charged to revenue of cost of services settlement charge excludes amount charged to revenue of selling  general and administrative excludes restructuring costs of and depreciation and amortization restructuring costs goodwill impairment interest expense  net other income  net total costs of services fiscal costs of services cos  excluding the specified contract charge  the settlement charge  and the restructuring charges noted above  as a percentage of revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the year over year cos trend was favorably impacted by out of period adjustments of million  which was comprised of million of favorable fiscal out of period adjustments and million of adverse fiscal out of period adjustments which did not repeat in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fiscal nps cos ratio decreased primarily due to a net favorable year over year adjustment to cos of million on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
fiscal revenue included million of favorable adjustments as compared to fiscal  which had million of adverse adjustments 
of the million  million related to three contracts  one each with the department of labor  us air force and the state of north carolina 
the nps cos ratio also benefited from a million adverse fiscal revenue adjustment resulting from a contract settlement with the us government that did not recur  and million year over year net favorable revenue adjustment on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
the lower mss cos ratio for fiscal was primarily due to year over year operational improvements on contracts which had performance issues in fiscal the operational improvements were a result of continued focus on troubled accounts  greater focus on cost take out by standardization of products and processes including diagnostics and re engineering and greater focus on delivery 
this year over year improvement was illustrated by reduced year over year adverse impact of asset impairments of million  net favorable year over year adjustments to cos and revenue on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of million and million  respectively  and reduced year over year impact of transition cost overruns of million 
the cos also benefited from operational efficiencies resulting from the implementation of the turnaround strategy  such as improved cost controls  headcount reductions through restructuring  centralized procurement  better discipline around contract management  rationalized organizational spans and layers  and reduced enterprise overhead 
these efficiencies are partially offset by costs related to start up issues on certain new contracts 
the lower bss cos ratio for fiscal was primarily due to the fiscal adverse revenue adjustment of million associated with a contract with the nhs 
in addition  the bss cos ratio was favorably impacted by lower costs within bss consulting services due to staff reductions  and adversely impacted by a higher cos ratio in the financial services group due to lower revenue 
the twelve month cos ratio was favorably impacted by a year over year change of million related to adjustments on contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  including a year over year favorable adjustment to revenue of million 
fiscal cos  excluding the specified contract charge  the settlement charge  and the restructuring charges noted above  as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal both fiscal and fiscal cos were adversely impacted by out of period adjustments recorded during these years but which were related to prior years 
the amounts recorded in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively  in mss and million and million  respectively  in bss 
the fiscal increase in the cos ratio was primarily driven by adverse results in the mss and bss segments 
the mss cos ratio was impacted by adverse adjustments on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of million of which million was recorded as a reduction of revenue  impairment of tangible and intangible assets of million associated primarily with service delivery issues on certain outsourcing contracts  and start up issues on certain outsourcing contracts  including transition cost overruns of million 
of these specific charges of million  million were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal bss cos ratio was adversely impacted primarily by the nhs contract and the financial services business 
subsequent to the billion nhs adjustment recorded in the third quarter of fiscal  and pending the finalization of a contract amendment  the company recorded million of operating losses in the fourth quarter see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  a year over year shift in bss financial services revenue mix  caused by a decline in the proportion of the higher margin license revenue  adversely impacted the bss cos ratio 
bss cos ratio was impacted by adverse adjustments of million on certain long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  of which million was recorded as reduction in revenue 
the nps cos ratio increased primarily as a result of recording million of net adverse adjustments on certain long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
the net adjustments included adverse adjustments of million  of which million reduced revenue  and favorable adjustments of million  of which million increased revenue 
favorable adjustments included a million cos benefit on a contract that had a similar adjustment in fiscal of the total million net adverse adjustments  million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal costs of services settlement charge during the second quarter of fiscal  the company reached a settlement agreement with the us government relating to its contract claims asserted under the contract disputes act of cda

the contract extension contained a requirements portion and an indefinite quantity portion and is not subject to any minimum values 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
selling  general and administrative fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expense  excluding the restructuring charges  as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the fiscal increase was primarily driven by an increase in corporate general administrative g a costs and a higher mss ratio  partially offset by decreases in nps and bss ratios 
the higher mss ratio was primarily due to the reclassification of million of costs from cos to sg a in fiscal in addition  there were higher costs in fiscal associated with the remediation efforts of investigation findings see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the lower nps ratio was primarily due to the cost reduction initiatives and lower bid and proposal costs due to delays in government procurements  fewer opportunities and more selectivity in the bid process towards higher margin targets 
the lower bss ratio was primarily due to the fiscal adverse revenue adjustment of million associated with a contract with the nhs 
the lower ratio was also attributable to a lower run rate within isoft due to cost take out activity  including back office integration  and fiscal acquisition and transition costs of million  which did not repeat in fiscal corporate g a for fiscal was million and increased million as compared to the prior year 
the higher fiscal expense was primarily due to accrual of million on account of the settlement of the consolidated shareholder securities class action lawsuit see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this amount was partially offset by million that was recoverable under the company corporate insurance policies 
in addition  the fiscal increase was also due to higher professional fees of million primarily associated with the company financial transformation  higher internal audit fees of million  and higher stock based compensation and bonus expense 
partially offsetting the increases in the corporate g a was net reduced legal fees associated with the sec investigation and class action lawsuits due to million of insurance claims that offset the fiscal legal expenses of million 
fiscal sg a expense  excluding the restructuring charges  as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the fiscal increase was primarily driven by an increase in corporate g a costs and a higher bss ratio 
the corporate g a costs increased year over year primarily due to higher legal and other fees of million incurred  mainly related to the ongoing sec and audit committee investigations into the matters surrounding the out of period adjustments and additional legal and other professional fees in connection with consolidated securities class action lawsuits filed in federal court see note to the consolidated financial statements 
corporate g a costs were also higher due to costs associated with the former ceo severance of million 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower bonuses of million and reduced stock compensation expense of million  principally due to reduction in the probable outcome of performance based restricted stock units for certain executives 
the bss ratio increased primarily due to the acquisition of isoft 
isoft sg a ratio was adversely impacted by million of transaction and transition costs incurred related to its acquisition 
goodwill impairment during the second quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill  proceeding directly to the first step of the impairment test  for all reporting units and concluded that no impairment had occurred 
due to the divestiture of our credit services business in the third quarter of fiscal  which caused the allocation of million of goodwill from our bss financial services bss fs reporting unit to that disposed business  we assessed the goodwill remaining on bss fs balance sheet for potential impairment 
we performed the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test and concluded that the goodwill remaining on bss fs balance sheet  after the allocation of goodwill to the divested business  was not impaired 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  for reporting units with goodwill  we evaluated whether there were factors which would indicate a potential impairment of goodwill 
the company considered  among other factors  any significant changes in the company fiscal forecast since the annual impairment test was performed  the outlook for the company business and industry  the company market capitalization  and the current economic environment and outlook 
based on that evaluation  the company determined that there have been no events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of the reporting units below their carrying amounts  and  as a result  it was unnecessary to perform the first step of the two step impairment testing process 
based on the company fiscal annual goodwill impairment analysis performed during the second quarter  it was concluded that fair value was below carrying value for three reporting units mss  bss global business solutions bss gbs and the bss healthcare group bss health 
management believed that the decline in the estimated fair values of these reporting units was a result of several factors  including uncertainty about the company overall value as reflected in csc stock price decline over the first half of fiscal  overall decline in the broader stock market as indicated by reduced performance metric multiples at comparable public companies  and decline in forecasted operating performance of these reporting units 
at that time  the company recorded its best estimated goodwill impairment charge of  million  of which  million related to the mss reporting unit  million related to the bss gbs reporting unit  and million related to the bss health reporting unit 
during the third quarter of fiscal  based on the finalization of the annual test begun in the prior quarter  the company recorded adjustments that reduced the impairment loss recorded in the second quarter by million  to  million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of million on the goodwill related to its reporting unit bss health 
after recording this impairment charge  the bss health reporting unit had no remaining goodwill 
depreciation and amortization fiscal depreciation and amortization d a as a percentage of revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in the fiscal ratio was driven by decreases in the mss and bss segments 
the lower mss ratio was due to reduced d a expense as a result of significant impairments of fixed and intangible assets recorded in fiscal  as well as a reduction in capital expenditures in fiscal the lower bss ratio was due to the fiscal adverse revenue adjustment of million associated with the nhs contract  as well due to lower depreciation expense due to certain data center assets associated with the nhs contract coming to the end of their useful lives 
fiscal d a as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in the fiscal ratio was driven by all three segments 
the bss ratio increased due to higher amortization expense associated with the acquired isoft intangible and tangible assets 
the higher mss ratio is due to higher capital expenditure on outsourcing contracts 
the higher nps ratio is due to higher fixed asset purchases on certain of its contracts  as well as amortization of acquired intangible assets from fiscal and acquisitions

the finance act of the finance act was signed into law in india on may th  the act provides for the taxation of indirect foreign investment in india  including on a retroactive basis 
the finance act overrides the recent vodafone ruling by the supreme court of india which held that the indian tax authorities cannot assess capital gains taxes on the sale of shares of non indian companies that indirectly own shares in an indian company 
the retroactive nature of these changes in law has been strongly criticized 
the finance act has been challenged in the indian courts 
however  there is no assurance that such a challenge will be successful

during the second quarter of fiscal  based on its analysis of these items  the company recorded net credits of million in pre tax out of period adjustments impacting prior fiscal years 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company identified additional prior period errors 
such errors identified in the third quarter  which were self correcting in the third quarter of fiscal  have no impact on income from continuing operations before taxes for fiscal the accounting errors identified during fiscal are primarily related to either costs incurred under the contract or the estimation of contract revenues and costs at completion  which resulted in the overstatement of income from continuing operations before taxes 
the company has concluded that there is no cumulative impact of this overstatement as a result of the billion specified contract charge recorded as of december  being overstated by the same amount 
the company has concluded that the errors identified during fiscal do not appear to have any impact on amounts charged to the nhs 
based on information provided by independent counsel  the company believes that a small portion of such adjustments should be characterized as intentional accounting irregularities

the exclusion of certain costs incurred under the contract caused the estimated margin at completion  which determines the operating income that is booked when revenue milestones are achieved  to be overstated 
although the company has concluded that there is no cumulative impact as a result of the billion charge relating to the nhs contract recorded as of december   operating income from fiscal year through and including fiscal has been overstated by a total of approximately million and  therefore  the charge taken by the company as of december  was overstated by approximately the same amount 
certain additional items had been identified related to the nhs contract that could have had an effect on the amount and the allocation of the out of period adjustments for fiscal and prior fiscal years 
these additional items were subject to further investigation and therefore were not recorded in fiscal see our discussion of fiscal adjustments above for further information regarding the impact of such items 
certain csc finance employees based in the u 
k 
were aware prior to fiscal of the aforementioned errors  but those employees failed to appropriately correct the errors 
therefore  the company has classified these errors as intentional

based upon the company investigation  review of underlying documentation for certain transactions and balances  review of contract documentation and discussions with nordic personnel  the company attributes the majority of the million of pre tax adjustments recorded in the nordic region in fiscal to accounting irregularities arising from suspected intentional misconduct by certain former employees in our danish subsidiaries

historical background is also presented below 
interim agreement contract change note on august   the company and the nhs entered into a binding interim agreement which has been approved by all required uk government officials interim agreement contract change note or iaccn 
the iaccn  which is described in greater detail below  amended the terms of the parties then current contract under which the company has developed and deployed an integrated patient records system using the company lorenzo regional care software product 
on march   the company and the nhs signed a letter agreement that modified certain financial terms of the iaccn 
the iaccn  and such letter agreement  forms the basis on which the parties will subsequently finalize a full restatement of the contract through a revised project agreement 
the revised project agreement will consolidate the three regional contracts which comprise the company nhs contract into a single agreement 
csc and the nhs are in the process of negotiating the revised project agreement 
under the iacnn  the parties redefined the scope of the lorenzo products and established deployment and ongoing service pricing 
csc will deliver additional lorenzo implementations based on demand from individual nhs trusts 
a more flexible arrangement than under the contract terms existing prior to the iaccn has been established for these trusts to combine additional clinical modules with the core care management functionality of the lorenzo solution to meet their specific requirements 
csc and the nhs also agreed to a process for trusts which wish to take the lorenzo products within the nhs designated north  midlands and east regions of england nme to obtain central funding from the uk department of health for implementation of the lorenzo products 
separately  csc may offer the lorenzo solution throughout the rest of england where trusts select csc solutions through separate competitive processes 
under the iaccn  the nhs is no longer subject to trust volume commitments and csc has agreed to non exclusive deployment rights in its designated regions 
new trusts taking deployments of the lorenzo product will receive ongoing managed services from csc for a period of five years from the date of lorenzo deployment by such trust  provided deployment is complete or substantially complete by july beyond its lorenzo offerings  csc continues to provide a wide range of other solutions and services to the nhs  including general practitioner  ambulance and community systems  digital imaging and other related services 
pursuant to the letter agreement signed on march   the parties agreed to modify a small number of financial terms of the iaccn and the nhs confirmed it would make a change compensation payment in accordance with the terms of the iaccn 
the nhs paid the change compensation payment of million million net of value added tax to csc on march  in full and final satisfaction of all costs and claims by csc arising from changes to lorenzo that csc delivered up to a certain version of the product  in addition to a small number of other changes 
historical background concerning nhs contract the company and the nhs are parties to a contract originally having a value of billion or approximately billion at originally announced exchange rates under which the company has developed and deployed an integrated electronic patient records system 
the nhs contract was amended in april and the parties entered into variation agreements subsequent to the amendment agreeing to various operational terms and conditions 
the amendment included mutual releases of all claims existing at the time of the amendment 
in  as part of the uk government austerity program and to address delays in development and deployments  the company and the nhs discussed modification of the contract scope in order to reduce the total contract value by million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  additional scope modification and total contract value reduction were discussed  bringing the combined total contract value reductions to million  which would have reduced the total contract value to approximately billion or billion at the march  exchange rate 
terms related to this scope modification and contract value reduction were included in a negotiated but unsigned non binding memorandum of understanding mou  which mou included a legally binding standstill agreement which provided that  while the parties were negotiating a contract amendment to implement the terms of the mou  neither party would pursue any claims against the other party 
negotiation of the terms of the mou was confirmed by the nhs to be substantially completed in may  but csc was subsequently informed by the nhs in december that neither the mou nor the related contract amendment then under discussion would be approved by the uk government 
based on subsequent discussions between csc and the nhs regarding proposals advanced by both parties reflecting significant scope modifications  a reduced commitment by the nhs for deployment of the lorenzo software product  revised delivery and payment terms  payments by the nhs for csc incurred costs and commitment and contract value reductions that differed materially from those contemplated by the mou  on march   csc and the nhs entered into a non binding letter of intent that included the statement of principles that would serve as the basis for an interim agreement between the parties 
the letter of intent contemplated that under the interim agreement  the nhs would provide a commitment of a certain number of trusts to receive the lorenzo software product  and the lorenzo product was redefined into deployment units categorized as base product and additional product in each case  as described below for pricing purposes 
the letter of intent also included a standstill agreement related to the lorenzo product 
while the parties originally intended to conclude a binding interim agreement by june   no agreement was reached by that date 
on may   the standstill agreement was extended to august  on august   the parties entered into the iaccn 
on march   the company and the nhs signed a letter agreement that modified certain financial terms of the iacnn 
principal components of iaccn the iaccn sets the terms relating to the delivery of the lorenzo product and associated services as described below 
the key terms introduced by the iaccn are as follows under contract terms existing prior to the iaccn  the nhs was committed to purchase the lorenzo product for multiple trusts 
in addition  the company was the exclusive supplier of such software products and related services to two out of the three regions of the uk covered by the existing contract 
under the iaccn  the nhs is no longer subject to any trust volume commitment for the lorenzo product there were no changes in quantities for non lorenzo deployments  and the company agreed to non exclusive deployment rights for all products and services in those regions in which it previously enjoyed exclusivity 
as a result  the individual trusts can choose third party software vendors other than csc to provide a software solution 
csc and the nhs have also agreed to a process for trusts which wish to take the lorenzo products within the nme regions to obtain central funding from the uk department of health for implementation of the lorenzo products 
in addition  csc may offer the lorenzo solution throughout the rest of england where trusts select csc solutions through a separate competitive process 
the iaccn creates pricing and payment terms for the lorenzo product and new terms under which trusts in the contract nme region that choose the lorenzo product can access central funds for its deployment  subject to business case justification 
while the funding is provided by the nhs  there is a far greater degree of interaction with the trusts under the iaccn  as the company works with each individual trust to build a business case and seek nhs approval and central funding to proceed 
the iaccn has not materially altered the terms relating to non lorenzo products 
the company will continue to provide non lorenzo deployment  hosting and maintenance services in accordance with contract terms in existence prior to the iaccn 
the deployment of the non lorenzo products is expected to be completed or substantially completed by fiscal under the iaccn  the lorenzo product is redefined for pricing purposes  with lorenzo regional care comprising the base product  consisting of seven deployment units or modules and the additional product  consisting of three other modules 
the parties agreed that six of the base product modules had completed the necessary nhs assurances and were ready to deploy to further trusts as of august  the remaining module of the base product was similarly accepted by the nhs as complete and ready to deploy to further trusts in early september the additional product three modules are expected to complete nhs assurance during although the nhs assurance of the base product seven modules is complete and the company and the nhs are committed to complete the assurance of the additional product modules  neither the nhs nor any trust is obligated to purchase or deploy any of those modules 
new trusts taking deployments of the lorenzo product will receive ongoing managed services from the company for a period of five years from the date such deployment is complete  provided deployment is complete or substantially complete by july  the services include hosting of the software and trust data at the company data center as well as support and maintenance  including regulatory updates and other changes over the term of the contract 
under contract terms existing prior to the iaccn  all services were to expire upon the end of the contract term of july   subject to an optional one year extension and an exit transition period 
accounting prior to the iaccn  the nhs contract has been accounted for using the percentage of completion method based on management best estimates of total contract revenue and costs 
based on then existing circumstances  csc revised its estimate of revenues and costs at completion during the third quarter of fiscal to include only those revenues reasonably assured of collection 
as a result of that change  the company recorded a billion contract charge in that quarter  resulting in no material remaining net assets 
the terms of the iaccn represent a significant modification to the prior agreement  including a significant reduction in additional product development and elimination of any commitment by the nhs to future lorenzo deployments and the company exclusivity rights in two of the three contract regions 
the company concluded that it will account for the iaccn as a new contract and will recognize revenue as a services arrangement 
revenue recognition for each trust deployment will begin at the start of the trust hosting period 
payments from the nhs for deployment of systems will be deferred and recognized over the service period 
direct costs incurred for deployment activities will be deferred and amortized to expense over the service period as well 
the total up front consideration of million million  including the million million net settlement payment and a million million escrow release  is primarily attributed to future lorenzo deployments and will be deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract ending july the million million payment received on march   as well as future consideration not noted above  when and if earned  will be deferred and amortized over the longer of the term of the contract or the estimated performance period 
financial condition cash flows amounts in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal net cash from operations net cash provided by used in investing net cash used in from financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year operating cash flow net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal of  million decreased million as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to higher pension plan funding of million  restructuring payments of million  and non recurrence of cash inflow of million received in the third quarter of fiscal in connection with settlement of claims with the us government 
these decreases were partially offset by a year over year favorable impact of million associated with the nhs contract as described below  lower payroll related payments of million reflecting lower headcount  and higher cash collections from customers 
the year over year favorable cash impact associated with the nhs contract in fiscal was due to the second quarter receipt of million  million in relation to the settlement agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements and million primarily related to the achievement of a milestone during the first quarter  and non recurrence of the fiscal repayment to the nhs of million 
for fiscal  net cash from operating activities of  million decreased million as compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily due to higher payroll and related costs primarily due to the fiscal acquisitions and repayment of nhs advance contract payments see note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by receipt of cash upon settlement of claims with the us government see note to the consolidated financial statements and reduced cash taxes 
investing cash flow net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal of million increased  million compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to net proceeds of  million from the fiscal divestitures see note to the consolidated financial statements  less net cash used for purchase of property and equipment and software and payment of outsourcing costs of million  and less cash used for acquisitions of million 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal of billion increased million compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase in payments for business acquisitions of million  and higher expenditures on software of million 
these increases were partially offset by lower purchases of property and equipment of million  lower proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million  and lower proceeds from two divestitures of million in fiscal  which did not recur in fiscal financing cash flow net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  an increase of million from fiscal the increase was primarily due to share repurchases of million  higher payments to non controlling interests of million  and higher debt issuance costs of million  partially offset by higher net proceeds from borrowings of million and higher proceeds from stock options of million 
the higher net proceeds from borrowings comprised proceeds from the issuance of new long term debt of  million  partially offset by net repayments on borrowings of million 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal was million  a decrease of  million from fiscal this decrease was primarily due to repayment of billion related to a credit facility in the third quarter of fiscal  partially offset by higher repayments on capital leases and other long term debt 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were  million at march  and  million at march  of the total cash at march    million was held outside of the us it is generally management intent to permanently reinvest earnings of its foreign operations 
however  if these funds are needed for our us operations  the company can repatriate a substantial amount of cash to the us through settlement of inter company loans in a tax efficient manner 
should the company determine to repatriate cash as dividends  it would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes 
the cash held outside of the us can be used to fund acquisitions  such as the fiscal acquisitions of isoft and applabs 
at the end of fiscal  csc s ratio of debt to total capitalization was  a decrease from at the end of fiscal the decrease in the debt to total capitalization ratio was primarily the result of an increase in total equity associated with the fiscal net income of million 
the following table summarizes the company s debt to total capitalization ratios as of fiscal year end and amount in millions march  march  debt equity total capitalization debt to total capitalization at march   the company had million of short term borrowings and current maturities of long term debt  and  million of long term debt 
there were no borrowings outstanding against the company commercial paper program and no amounts were drawn under the company committed revolving credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company raised million from the issuance of million senior notes and of million senior notes  and drew down million against its new term loan credit facility 
in the third quarter  the proceeds from new borrowings  plus available cash  were used to fund the early redemption of million term notes due march and of million term notes due february the early redemption of billion of term notes resulted in a million loss that was charged to interest expense 
the company committed revolving line of credit of billion serves as liquidity support for the company commercial paper program 
both the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility require the company to maintain certain financial covenants and the company was in compliance with these requirements as of march  during the fourth quarter  the company raised million through a structured finance arrangement by selling its interest in the security instruments of a consolidated subsidiary 
in this negotiated arrangement  the company sold its interest in a british pound note receivable and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a consolidated subsidiary to a financial institution 
the company interest in the note receivable due and its interest in the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock due  were sold for total cash consideration of million million as of march  and million  respectively 
during fiscal  the company divested four non core businesses and received net proceeds of  million 
the company used the proceeds from these divestitures to incrementally fund its us and canadian pension plan trusts by million  repurchase common shares as described below  and fund its restructuring program 
although the divestitures will cause a reduction of future cash flows  any shortfalls are expected to be partially offset by the benefits to be realized from the company ongoing restructuring program 
on december   csc board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to billion in share repurchases of the company outstanding common stock repurchase program 
the timing  volume  and nature of future share repurchases will be at the discretion of management  and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
csc board of directors has not established an end date for the repurchase program 
during fiscal  the company repurchased million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million in open market purchases  of which million was paid in cash and the remainder accrued 
in fiscal  the company continued paying quarterly cash dividends to its common stockholders 
during the year  cash dividends of per share  or approximately million  were paid out 
the company has sufficient liquidity and expects to continue paying quarterly cash dividends although such payments are subject to continued approval by the board of directors 
liquidity risk the company s total liquidity comprises cash and cash equivalents plus borrowing available under its credit facility 
as of march   the company s total liquidity was approximately billion  consisting of billion of cash and the full billion available under the credit facility 
in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  available cash balances  and from available borrowings under the company undrawn credit facilities 
if these resources need to be augmented  additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to issue additional debt or equity with acceptable terms in the future 
as noted above  the company holds  million of cash outside of the us should the company repatriate any portion of this cash as dividends  it would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes 
the company exposure to operational liquidity is primarily from long term contracts which require significant investment of cash flows from operating activities during the initial phases of the contracts 
the recovery of these investments is over the life of the contract and is dependent upon the company performance as well as customer acceptance 
continued uncertainty in global economic conditions may also affect the company business as customers and suppliers may decide to downsize  defer or cancel contracts which could negatively affect operating cash flows 
the three major rating agencies that rate the company debt took ratings actions during the first quarter of fiscal on may   moody lowered the company long term credit rating from baa with a negative watch to baa with a stable outlook 
moody confirmed its short term rating at p on may   s p and fitch lowered the credit rating to bbb with a negative outlook and a short term rating of a and f respectively 
each of s p and fitch subsequently took rating actions during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and raised the outlook assessment on the company to stable without changing their underlying ratings  on march  and march   respectively 
the most recent ratings and outlooks issued by moody  s p and fitch are described in the table below rating agency rating outlook short term ratings fitch bbb stable f moody baa stable p s p bbb stable a credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and  therefore  the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time 
accordingly  we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above 
factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance  our financial position  outcome of ongoing litigation as well as regulatory action  such as the sec investigation  and changes in our business strategy 
if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur  they could impact  among other things  our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in our financial condition  revenues  or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that is material to investors 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the expiration of the company s financial guarantees and stand by letters of credit outstanding as of march  amounts in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total surety bonds letters of credit stand by letters of credit total the following table summarizes the company s future payments  excluding the effects of time value  on contractual obligations by period as of march  amounts in millions year or less years years more than years total debt interest and preferred dividend payments capitalized lease liabilities operating leases minimum purchase obligations total includes scheduled principal payments and mandatory redemption of preferred stock of consolidated subsidiary 
excludes capitalized lease liabilities 
includes scheduled interest payments on long term debt and scheduled dividend payments associated with the mandatorily redeemable cumulative preferred stock outstanding 
excludes the contingent dividends associated with the participation and variable appreciation premium features on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock outstanding 
the liability related to unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the table because a reasonable estimate of the timing and amount of cash outflows from future tax settlements cannot be determined 
regarding minimum purchase obligations included above  the company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software  hardware  telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing  committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities 
the company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years 
if the company does not meet the specified service minimums  the company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or the entire shortfall 
during fiscal  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million to pension and million to postretirement benefit plans 
the company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets  which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations 
during fiscal  pension and other pension benefits contributions amounted to million  an increase of million from million in fiscal refer to the critical accounting estimates section later in this md a and to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
dividends during fiscal  quarterly dividends declared aggregated to per share or million 
of the total dividends declared  million was declared but unpaid at march   and was paid on april  critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of the estimates made are for contract specific issues 
changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified several critical accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition  cost estimation and recoverability on long term  fixed price contracts  revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization  capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs  estimates used to determine deferred income taxes  assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill  assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities  and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates that may change over time 
however  some arrangements are subject to specific accounting guidance that may require significant estimates  including contracts subject to percentage of completion accounting  contracts that include multiple element deliverables  and contracts subject to software accounting guidance 
percentage of completion method certain software development projects  all long term construction type contracts  and certain contracts with the us federal government require the use of estimates at completion in the application of the percentage of completion accounting method  whereby the determination of revenues and costs on a contract through its completion can require significant judgment and estimation 
under this method  and subject to the effects of changes in estimates  we recognize revenue using an estimated margin at completion as contract milestones or other input or output based measures are achieved 
this can result in costs being deferred as work in process until contractual billing milestones are achieved 
alternatively  this can result in revenue recognized in advance of billing milestones if output based or input based measures are achieved 
contracts that require estimates at completion using the percentage of completion method accounted for approximately of the company revenues 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of revenues  costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers  program managers and financial professionals 
the company follows this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made  however  some estimates are particularly difficult for activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects 
key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  results of testing procedures  and progress toward completion 
management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become evident 
modifications to contract scope  schedule  and price may be required on contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery 
if recovery is deemed probable  we may  as appropriate  either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance 
we periodically negotiate such contract modifications 
multiple element arrangements many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers  which may include any combination of services  products or both 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the elements specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and  if so  how the total estimated revenue should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
allocation of total contract consideration to each element requires estimating the fair value or selling price of each element based on  as required  vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence tpe or management best estimate of selling price besp for the deliverables when vsoe or tpe are not available 
vsoe is established for an element based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
tpe is established by considering our competitors prices for comparable product and service offerings in the market in which we operate 
when we conclude that comparable products or services are sold by competitors to similarly situated customers  we consult available information sources to arrive at tpe such as published list prices  quoted market prices  and industry reports 
we establish besp consistent with our existing pricing practices involving a cost plus reasonable margin methodology  and comparison of the margins to margins realized on recent contracts for similar products or services in that market 
once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements  revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered if the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume differences  changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 
software sales if significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product  and vsoe is available to support accounting for the software as a separate unit of account  the software is determined to be delivered as the customization services are performed and revenue is recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above 
thus  cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project  and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results 
additionally  the company ability to establish and maintain vsoe of fair value depends on sufficient transaction volumes and sufficient consistent separate pricing of the undelivered elements 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
capitalization of outsourcing contract costs certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition set up costs  costs associated with installation of systems and processes  and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of assets acquired ie  premiums 
finance staff  working with program management  review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance 
key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of assets acquired from a customer in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs 
we utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management  operations  procurement and finance areas  as well as third parties on occasion  to determine fair values of assets acquired 
to assess recoverability  undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to contract related assets  including the unamortized deferred cost balance 
such estimates require judgment and assumptions  which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel 
key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies 
a significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software 
significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on estimated useful lives  estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues  and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment 
for commercial software products  determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products 
we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues  including an assessment of alternative solutions or products  current and historical demand for the product  and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 
for internal use software  the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis 
to assess the recoverability of capitalized software costs  we must estimate future revenue  costs and cash flows 
such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows  and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff 
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 
estimates used to determine income tax expense we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also must analyze income tax reserves  as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained under examination 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgment in identifying acquired intangible assets  such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of acquired assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values 
independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities 
such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by the company  such as forecasted revenues or profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract related acquired intangible assets or liabilities 
purchase accounting assessments consider many factors which are analyzed by company representatives in the legal  finance  human resources  information systems  program management and other areas  as appropriate 
additional information obtained during the allocation period related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities  resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired  as well as differences in actual and estimated results  could result in material impacts to earnings 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with asc goodwill and other intangible assets 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an event representing an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and reductions in revenue or profitability growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test initially involves the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the company determines that it is not more likely than not  then the subsequent two step process is not required  although the company has the option to bypass the initial qualitative assessment stage and proceed directly to perform a step one analysis 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not  then it proceeds with the subsequent two step goodwill impairment testing process 
the first step is to compare each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value  no further procedures are required 
however  if a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  an impairment of goodwill may exist  requiring a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in this step  the reporting unit s fair value is determined and is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business acquisition 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the company estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach incorporates the use of a discounted cash flow method in which the estimated future cash flows and terminal values for each reporting unit are discounted to a present value using a discount rate 
cash flow projections are based on management estimates of economic and market conditions which drive key assumptions of revenue growth rates  operating margins  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the discount rate in turn is based on the specific risk characteristics of each reporting unit  the weighted average cost of capital and its underlying forecast 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying performance metric multiples to the reporting unit prior and expected operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit derived using the income approach is significantly different from the fair value estimate using the market approach  the company reevaluates its assumptions used in the two models 
the fair values determined by the market approach and income approach  as described above  are weighted to determine the fair value for each reporting unit 
the weighted values assigned to each reporting unit are primarily driven by two factors the number of comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach  and the similarity of the operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units to the comparable publicly traded companies used in the market approach 
in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values  the company also compares the sum of the reporting units fair values to its market capitalization per share stock price multiplied by shares outstanding and calculates an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization 
the company evaluates the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable transactions 
if the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions  the company will reevaluate its fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and or other assumptions 
as a result  when the price for csc s common stock is low  this reevaluation can result in lower estimated fair values of the reporting units 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates  operating margins  terminal growth rates  and capital expenditures  as well as discount rates 
estimates involve the assessment of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts  estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs  and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates 
in addition  judgments and assumptions are required for allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values of each reporting unit 
although we have consistently used the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain and can vary from actual results 
assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities we offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans 
csc utilizes actuarial methods required by asc compensation retirement benefits to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates 
we consider current market conditions such as changes in interest rates  in determining discount rates 
changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns on pension and postretirement plan assets 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the asset mix of the plan and other factors 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
the weighted average of the expected long term rate of return  for all pension plans  on plan assets utilized for the fiscal and pension plan valuations was and  respectively 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percentage increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased the fiscal net periodic pension cost by approximately million  or increased it by approximately million  respectively 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension and postretirement plan actuarial valuation 
the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension and postretirement plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
the weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal net periodic pension cost was compared to used for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the fiscal net periodic pension cost by approximately million  or increased it by approximately million  respectively 
some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts 
the accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur 
for example  while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns  differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year 
such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized into earnings over time 
during fiscal  the actual return on assets exceeded the expected return on assets  producing an actuarial gain 
additionally  asset values increased due to the million of discretionary employer contributions made to the us and canadian pension plans see note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  partially offsetting this actuarial gain was an actuarial loss increasing the projected benefit obligation of the company pension plans primarily due to the decline in discount rates 
as a result  pension assets as a percentage of projected benefit obligations increased during the fiscal year 
assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax and other issues arising in the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management view of the expected outcome 
csc consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with asc contingencies 
significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
for the year ended march   a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have had a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
foreign currency as a large global organization  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these contracts by incurring costs in the same currency in which revenue is received  and any related short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
thus  by generally matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company is able to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency risk to earnings 
however  as the company has increased its use of offshore support in recent years  it has become more exposed to currency fluctuations 
the company has policies and procedures to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency by using foreign currency forwards to hedge intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities 
for accounting purposes  these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and thus all changes in fair value are reported in net earnings as part of other income expense 
the company also uses foreign currency options to manage its exposure to economic risk caused by exchange rate fluctuations
