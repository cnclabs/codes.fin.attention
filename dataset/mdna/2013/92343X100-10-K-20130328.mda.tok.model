our solutions are designed to handle massive amounts of unstructured and structured information from different sources  quickly make sense of complex scenarios  and generate evidence and intelligence 
for the years ended january    and  this segment represented approximately   and of our total revenue  respectively 
generally  we make business decisions by evaluating the risks and rewards of the opportunities available to us in the markets served by each of our segments 
we view each operating segment differently and allocate capital  personnel  resources  and management attention accordingly 
in reviewing each operating segment  we also review the performance of that segment by geography 
our marketing and sales strategies  expansion opportunities  and product offerings may differ materially within a particular segment geographically  as may our allocation of resources between segments 
when making decisions regarding investment in our business  increasing capital expenditures  or making other decisions that may reduce our profitability  we also consider the leverage ratio in our revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources for more information 
key trends and developments in our business we believe that there are many factors that affect our ability to sustain and increase both revenue and profitability  including market acceptance of actionable intelligence for unstructured data  particularly analytics 
we are in an early stage market where the value of certain aspects of our products and solutions is still in the process of market acceptance 
we believe that our future growth depends in part on the continued and increasing acceptance and realization of the value of our data analytics across our product offerings 
technological change 
our success depends in part on our ability to keep pace with technological changes and evolving industry standards in our product offerings and to successfully develop  launch  and drive demand for new and enhanced  innovative  high quality solutions that meet or exceed customer needs 
information technology spending 
our growth and results depend in part on general economic conditions and the pace of information technology spending by both commercial and governmental customers 
see also risk factors under item a for a more complete description of these and other risks that may impact future revenue and profitability 
recent developments on august   we entered into the cti merger agreement providing for the cti merger  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the cti merger agreement 
following the satisfaction of the various conditions precedent to closing the cti merger  including the requisite approval of the cti merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by that agreement by our stockholders and the shareholders of cti  the cti merger was completed on february  the cti merger eliminated cti majority ownership and control of us 
further details regarding the cti merger appear in note  merger agreement with cti to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
on march   we entered into an amendment and restatement agreement with the lenders under the credit agreement providing for the amended credit agreement  which amended and restated the credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement provides for million of senior secured credit facilities  comprised of a million term loan maturing in september and a million revolving credit facility maturing in march  subject to increase up to a maximum increase of million and reduction from time to time according to the terms of the amended credit agreement 
the majority of the proceeds of the term loan under the amended credit agreement were used to repay all million of outstanding term loan borrowings under the credit agreement at the closing date of the amended credit agreement 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement revolving credit facility at the closing date 
further details regarding the amended credit agreement appear in note  subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 

table of contents our previous extended filing delay and related matters as previously disclosed  from march through march  we did not make periodic filings with the sec 
our previous extended filing delay arose as a result of certain internal and external investigations and reviews of accounting matters discussed in our prior public filings and led to the identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and the delisting of our common stock from nasdaq 
in connection with the foregoing and related matters  we incurred approximately million of professional fees and related expenses during the four years ended january  by june  we had concluded our internal investigation and reviews  filed with the sec annual reports for all required periods and quarterly reports for certain quarters for which we had not previously filed reports  resumed making timely periodic filings with the sec  relisted our common stock on nasdaq  settled an injunctive action by the sec  and resolved certain other matters with the sec 
critical accounting policies and estimates an appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results 
the accounting policies outlined below are considered to be critical because they can materially affect our operating results and financial condition  as these policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties 
the accuracy of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a range of possible outcomes and a number of underlying variables  many of which are beyond our control  and there can be no assurance that our estimates are accurate 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is a critical component of determining our operating results and is based on a complex set of accounting rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
we derive and report our revenue in two categories a product revenue  including sale of hardware products which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product essential functionality and licensing of software products  and b service and support revenue  including revenue from installation services  post contract customer support pcs  project management  hosting services  saas  product warranties  consulting and training services 
our customer arrangements may include any combination of these elements 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
for additional information  see note  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition for a particular arrangement is dependent upon such factors as the level of customization within the solution and the contractual delivery  acceptance  payment  and support terms with the customer 
significant judgment is required to conclude on each of these factors  and if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
we generally consider a purchase order or executed sales quote  when combined with a master license agreement  to constitute evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when the product is shipped or transmitted and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customers 
our typical customer arrangements do not include substantive product acceptance provisions  however  if such provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
if the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms  revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt  whichever is earlier 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended revenue recognition accounting standards that removed tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
also in october  the fasb amended the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple deliverable arrangement to require the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we elected to prospectively adopt the provisions of this new guidance as of february  for new and materially modified transactions entered into on or after that date 
our multiple element arrangements consist of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for arrangements within the scope of the multiple deliverable guidance  a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand alone value and there are no customer negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered elements 
for multiple element arrangements comprised only of hardware products and related services  we allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its 
table of contents vsoe  if available  tpe  if vsoe is not available  or esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the total transaction revenue is allocated to the multiple elements based on each element relative selling price compared to the total selling price 
the manner in which we account for multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software related elements was not affected by the amended multiple deliverable guidance 
we allocate a portion of the total purchase price to the undelivered elements  primarily installation services  pcs  consulting  and training  using vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements 
the remaining portion of the total transaction value is allocated to the delivered software  referred to as the residual method 
if we are unable to establish vsoe for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  revenue recognition is deferred for the entire arrangement until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
however  if the only undelivered element is pcs  we recognize the arrangement fee ratably over the pcs period 
for new or materially modified multiple element arrangements entered into on or after february  that are comprised of a combination of hardware and software elements  the total transaction value is bifurcated between the hardware elements and the software elements that are not essential to the functionality of the hardware  based on the relative selling prices of the hardware elements and the software elements as a group 
revenue is then recognized for the hardware and hardware related services following the hardware revenue recognition methodology outlined above and revenue for the software and software related services is recognized following the residual method or ratably over the pcs period if vsoe for pcs does not exist 
our policy for establishing vsoe for installation  consulting  and training is based upon an analysis of separate sales of services 
we utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell shaped curve approach to establish vsoe for our pcs offerings  depending upon the business segment  geographical region  or product line 
the timing of revenue recognition on software licenses and other revenue could be significantly impacted if we are unable to maintain vsoe on one or more undelivered elements during any quarterly period 
loss of vsoe could result in i the complete deferral of all revenue or ii ratable recognition of all revenue under a customer arrangement until such time as vsoe is re established 
if we are unable to re establish vsoe on one or more undelivered elements for an extended period of time it would impact our ability to accurately forecast the timing of quarterly revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we typically are not able to determine tpe for our products or our service and support offerings 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe does not exist  we determine esp for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  similar product offerings  margin objectives  geographies in which we offer our products and services  internal costs  competition  and product lifecycle 
the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by our management  taking into consideration our go to market strategies 
we have established processes to update esp for each element  when appropriate  to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience 
pcs revenue is derived from providing technical software support services and unspecified software updates and upgrades to customers on a when and if available basis 
pcs revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period which  in most cases  is one year 
when pcs is included within a multiple element arrangement  we utilize either the substantive renewal rate approach or the bell shaped curve approach to establish vsoe of the pcs  depending upon the business operating segment  geographical region  or product line 
under the substantive renewal rate approach  we believe it is necessary to evaluate whether both the support renewal rate and term are substantive  and whether the renewal rate is being consistently applied to subsequent renewals for a particular customer 
we establish vsoe under this approach through analyzing the renewal rate stated in the customer agreement and determining whether that rate is above the minimum substantive vsoe renewal rate established for that particular pcs offering 
the minimum substantive vsoe rate is determined based upon an analysis of revenue associated with historical pcs contracts 
typically  renewal rates of for pcs plans that provide when and if available upgrades  and for plans that do not provide for when and if available upgrades  would be deemed to be minimum substantive renewal rates 
for contracts that do not contain a stated renewal rate  revenue associated with the entire bundled arrangement is recognized ratably over the pcs term 
contracts that have a renewal rate below the minimum substantive vsoe rate are deemed to contain a more than insignificant discount element  for which vsoe cannot be established 
we recognize revenue for these arrangements over the period that the customer is entitled to renew their pcs at the discounted rate  but not to exceed the estimated economic life of the product 

table of contents under the bell shaped curve approach of establishing vsoe  we perform a vsoe compliance test to ensure that a substantial majority or over of our actual pcs renewals are within a narrow range of plus or minus of the median pricing 
some of our arrangements require significant customization of the product to meet the particular requirements of the customer 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized under contract accounting methods  typically using the percentage of completion poc method 
under the poc method  revenue recognition is generally based upon the ratio of hours incurred to date to the total estimated hours required to complete the contract 
profit estimates on long term contracts are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances  and any losses on contracts are recognized in the period that such losses become evident 
generally  the terms of long term contracts provide for progress billings based on completion of milestones or other defined phases of work 
significant judgment is often required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements  as well as whether a loss is expected to be incurred on the contract due to several factors including the degree of customization required and the customer existing environment 
we use historical experience  project plans  and an assessment of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the arrangement to establish these estimates 
uncertainties in these arrangements include implementation delays or performance issues that may or may not be within our control 
our saas offerings generally provide customers access to certain of our software within a cloud based information technology environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis 
we recognize revenue for subscription and related support services over the contract period originating when the subscription service is made available to the customer and the contractual hosting period has commenced 
we extend customary trade payment terms to our customers in the normal course of conducting business 
to assess the probability of collection for purposes of revenue recognition  we have established credit policies that establish prudent credit limits for our customers 
these credit limits are based upon our risk assessment of the customer ability to pay  their payment history  geographic risk  and other factors  and are not contingent upon the resale of the product or upon the collection of payments from their customers 
these credit limits are reviewed and revised periodically on the basis of updated customer financial statement information  payment performance  and other factors 
when a customer is not deemed creditworthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
we record provisions for estimated product returns in the same period in which the associated revenue is recognized 
we base these estimates of product returns upon historical levels of sales returns and other known factors 
actual product returns could be different from our estimates and current or future provisions for product returns may differ from historical provisions 
concessions granted to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the period in which they were granted and have been minimal in both amount and frequency 
product revenue derived from shipments to resellers and oems who purchase our products for resale are generally recognized when such products are shipped on a sell in basis since we do not expect our resellers or oems to carry inventory of our products 
this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns as well as other criteria regarding these customers 
we are also required to evaluate whether our resellers and oems have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers 
in this regard  we assess whether our resellers and oems are new  poorly capitalized  or experiencing financial difficulty  and whether they have a pattern of not paying as amounts become due on previous arrangements or seeking payment terms longer than those provided to end customers 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material change to the revenue reported in a particular period 
we have historically experienced insignificant product returns from resellers and oems  and our payment terms for these customers are similar to those granted to our end users 
our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our products by our resellers and oems to their customers 
if a reseller or oem develops a pattern of payment delinquency  or seeks payment terms longer than generally granted to our resellers or oems  we defer the recognition of revenue from transactions with that reseller or oem until the receipt of cash 
multiple contracts with a single counterparty executed within close proximity of each other are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement 
we record reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue 
shipping and handling fees and expenses that are billed to customers are recognized in revenue and the costs associated with such fees and expenses are recorded in cost of revenue 
historically  these fees and expenses have not been material 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue 
for multiple element arrangements that contain software and software related elements for which we are unable to establish vsoe of one or more elements  we use various available indicators of fair value and apply our best judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement revenue into product revenue and service revenue for financial reporting purposes 
installation services associated with our communications intelligence arrangements are included within product revenue as such amounts are not considered material 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable balances each accounting period and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we exercise a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the collectability of accounts receivable  including consideration of the creditworthiness of each customer  their collection history  and the related aging of past due receivables balances 
we evaluate specific accounts when we learn that a customer may be experiencing a deterioration of its financial condition due to lower credit ratings  bankruptcy  or other factors that may affect its ability to render payment 
accounting for business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development assets  and liabilities assumed  based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
these fair values are typically estimated with assistance from independent valuation specialists 
the purchase price allocation process requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  contractual support obligations assumed  and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies  expected costs to develop in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  cost of capital and discount rates  and estimating the useful lives of acquired assets as well as the pattern or manner in which the assets will amortize 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for applicable acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the contractual support obligations we are assuming from the acquired business 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach  which determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a reasonable profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services 
the sum of these costs and operating profit represents an approximation of the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligations 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we perform our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  as of november  or more frequently if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill may exist 
we review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a two step process 
if we decide that it is appropriate to perform a qualitative assessment and conclude that the fair value of a reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its carrying value  no further evaluation is necessary 
for reporting units where we perform the two step process  the first step requires us to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare that fair value to the respective carrying value  which includes goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  the goodwill is not considered impaired and no further evaluation is necessary 
if the carrying value is higher than the estimated fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is required 
in the second step  the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 
for reporting units where we decide to perform a qualitative assessment  our management assesses and makes judgments regarding a variety of factors which potentially impact the fair value of a reporting unit  including general economic conditions  
table of contents industry and market specific conditions  customer behavior  cost factors  our financial performance and trends  our strategies and business plans  capital requirements  management and personnel issues  and our stock price  among others 
management then considers the totality of these and other factors  placing more weight on the events and circumstances that are judged to most affect a reporting unit s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets  to reach a qualitative conclusion regarding whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
for reporting units where we perform the two step process  we utilize some or all of three primary approaches to assess fair value a an income based approach  using projected discounted cash flows  b a market based approach  using multiples of comparable companies  and c a transaction based approach  using multiples for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace 
our estimate of fair value of each reporting unit is based on a number of subjective factors  including a appropriate consideration of valuation approaches income approach  comparable public company approach  and comparable transaction approach  b estimates of future growth rates  c estimates of our future cost structure  d discount rates for our estimated cash flows  e selection of peer group companies for the comparable public company and the comparable transaction approaches  f required levels of working capital  g assumed terminal value  and h time horizon of cash flow forecasts 
the determination of reporting units also requires management judgment 
we assess whether a reporting unit exists within a reportable segment by identifying the unit  determining whether the unit qualifies as a business under gaap  and assessing the availability and regular review by segment management of discrete financial information for the unit 
we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long lived assets when an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
if any indicators are present  we perform a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets in question to their carrying amounts 
if the undiscounted cash flows used in the test for recoverability are less than the long lived assets carrying amount  we determine the fair value of the long lived asset and recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
we did not record any impairments of goodwill for the years ended january   or  as the fair values of all of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values 
since the estimated fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values as of november   and no indicators of potential impairment were identified between november  and january   we currently do not believe that our reporting units are at risk of impairment 
the assumptions and estimates used in this process are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments  and estimates we have used in our assessments are reasonable and appropriate  a material change in any of our assumptions or external factors could lead to future goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method which includes the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
under this approach  deferred taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid 
the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus deferred taxes 
deferred taxes result from differences between the financial statement and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
the effects of future changes in income tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
the calculation of our tax provision involves the application of complex tax laws and requires significant judgment and estimates 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets for each jurisdiction in which we operate at each reporting date  and we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income of the same character and in the same jurisdiction 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence in making this assessment  including  but not limited to  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning 
table of contents strategies 
in circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that our deferred tax assets are not more likely than not realizable  we establish a valuation allowance 
we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by assessing whether they are more likely than not sustainable  based solely on their technical merits  upon examination  and including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process 
the second step is to measure the associated tax benefit of each position as the largest amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable 
differences between the amount of tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in our income tax returns and the amount of tax benefits recognized in our financial statements represent our unrecognized income tax benefits  which we either record as a liability or as a reduction of deferred tax assets 
our policy is to include interest expense and or income and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
contingencies we recognize an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when and if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires the use of significant judgment and estimates 
one notable potential source of loss contingencies is pending or threatened litigation 
legal counsel and other advisors and experts are consulted on issues related to litigation as well as on matters related to contingencies occurring in the ordinary course of business 
accounting for stock based compensation we recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of significant assumptions including an estimate of the average period of time employees will retain stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited before completing vesting requirements  and the risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related expense recognized 
the assumptions we use in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent our best estimates  which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
cost of revenue we have made an accounting policy election whereby certain costs of product revenue  including hardware and third party software license fees  are capitalized and amortized over the same period that product revenue is recognized  while installation and other service costs are generally expensed as incurred  except for certain contracts recognized according to contract accounting 
for example  in a multiple element arrangement where revenue is recognized over the pcs support period  the cost of revenue associated with the product is capitalized upon product delivery and amortized over that same period 
however  the cost of revenue associated with the services is expensed as incurred in the period in which the services are performed 
in addition  we expense customer acquisition and origination costs to selling  general and administrative expense  including sales commissions  as incurred  with the exception of certain sales referral fees in our communications intelligence segment which are capitalized and amortized ratably over the revenue recognition period 
results of operations seasonality and cyclicality as is typical for many software and technology companies  our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors 
our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter 
moreover  revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year  potentially by a significant margin 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of incentive compensation plans for our sales personnel 
while 
table of contents seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry  this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance 
many other factors  including general economic conditions  may also have an impact on our business and financial results 
overview of operating results the following table sets forth a summary of certain key financial information for the years ended january    and year ended january  in thousands  except per share data revenue operating income net income attributable to verint systems inc common shares net income per share attributable to verint systems inc basic diluted year ended january  compared to year ended january  our revenue increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  in our enterprise intelligence segment  revenue increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  the increase consisted of a million increase in service and support revenue  and a million increase in product revenue 
in our communications intelligence segment  revenue increased approximately million  or  from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  the increase consisted of a million increase in service and support revenue and a million increase in product revenue 
in our video intelligence segment  revenue decreased approximately million  or  from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january   primarily due to a decrease in product revenue 
for additional details on our revenue by segment  see revenue by operating segment 
revenue in the americas  emea  and apac represented approximately   and of our total revenue  respectively  in the year ended january   compared to approximately   and  respectively  in the year ended january  further details of changes in revenue are provided below 
operating income was million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended january  this increase in operating income was primarily due to a million increase in gross profit from million to million  partially offset by an million increase in operating expenses  from million to million 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased gross profit in our enterprise intelligence segment 
the increase in operating expenses consisted of a million increase in selling  general and administrative expense  a million increase in net research and development expenses  and a million increase in amortization of other acquired intangible assets 
further details of changes in operating income are provided below 
net income attributable to verint systems inc common shares was million  and diluted net income per common share was  in the year ended january  compared to net income attributable to verint systems inc common shares of million  and diluted net income per common share of  in the year ended january  the increase in net income attributable to verint systems inc common shares and diluted net income per common share in the year ended january  was primarily due to our increased operating income  as described above  and a decrease in total other expense  net  due primarily to the termination of our may credit agreement the credit agreement during the year ended january  and repayment of the term loan under that agreement  which resulted in an million loss during the year ended january  there were no such losses recognized during the year ended january  a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and therefore our revenue and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates as noted above 
when comparing average exchange rates for the year ended january  to average exchange rates for the year ended january   the us dollar strengthened relative to the british pound sterling  euro  israeli shekel  and brazilian real  resulting in decreases in our revenue  cost of revenue and operating expenses on a us dollar denominated basis

table of contents enterprise intelligence segment year ended january  compared to year ended january  enterprise intelligence revenue increased approximately million  or  from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  the increase consisted of a million increase in service and support revenue and a million increase in product revenue 
the increase in service and support revenue was primarily due to an increase in our customer install base and the related support revenue generated from this customer base during the year ended january  and an increase in service and support revenue from business acquisitions in our enterprise intelligence segment that were consummated during the year ended january  the increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in product sales to new and existing customers during the year ended january  the continued growth of service revenue is attributable to various factors  including an increase in services associated with customer product upgrades  a higher component of service offerings in our standard arrangements  and our growing install base 
the aggregate value of executed license arrangements  which comprises the majority of our product revenue  can fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  enterprise intelligence revenue increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in service revenue due primarily to an increase in our customer install base and the related support revenue generated from this customer base during the year ended january  and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions in our enterprise intelligence segment primarily vovici during the year ended january  the increase in service revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in product revenue  which primarily relates to a large transaction whereby product delivery occurred in the year ended january  but a significant portion of the product revenue was not able to be recognized in the year ended january  due to certain contractual terms which caused the remaining product revenue to be recognized in future periods 
there were no comparable transactions in the prior year 
communications intelligence segment year ended january  compared to year ended january  communications intelligence revenue increased approximately million  or  from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  the increase consisted of an million increase in service and support revenue and a million increase in product revenue 
the increase in service and support revenue was primarily attributable to the progress realized during the current year on projects recognized using the poc method  some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year  and an increase in the customer install base 
the increase in product revenue was mainly due to an increase in product deliveries to customers  new communications intelligence product offerings  the inclusion of a full year product revenue from a business acquisition in our communications intelligence segment that was consummated during the year ended january   and to a lesser extent  on progress on projects being accounted for under the poc method  some of which commenced in the previous fiscal year

video intelligence segment year ended january  compared to year ended january  video intelligence revenue decreased approximately million  or  from million in the year ended january  to million in the year ended january  the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in product revenue  resulting largely from a decrease in sales of certain hardware products to a single large customer during the year ended january  as compared to the year ended january   as well as a reduction in product deliveries associated with a few other customers from period to period 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in product deliveries to other customers in the year ended january  as compared to the year ended january  year ended january  compared to year ended january  video intelligence revenue increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended january  from million in the year ended january  
table of contents the increase was primarily due to an million increase in product revenue attributable to an increase in product deliveries to customers and recognition of revenue associated with the completion of a project for a large customer during the year ended january   partially offset by a reduction in product revenue recognized from prior years multiple element arrangements 
these arrangements are being recognized ratably and allocated between product and service revenue over several quarters or years primarily due to the prior business practice of providing implied pcs to video intelligence customers for which vsoe did not exist 
the increase in product revenue was partially offset by a million decrease in service revenue due to a reduction in service revenue recognized from prior years multiple element arrangements where the entire arrangement was being recognized ratably over several quarters or years primarily due to the prior business practice of providing implied pcs to video intelligence customers for which vsoe did not exist 
volume and price we sell products in multiple configurations  and the price of any particular product varies depending on the configuration of the product sold 
due to the variety of customized configurations for each product we sell  we are unable to quantify the amount of any revenue increases attributable to a change in the price of any particular product and or a change in the number of products sold 
revenue by product revenue and service and support revenue we derive and report our revenue in two categories a product revenue  including licensing of software products and sale of hardware products which include software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product essential functionality  and b service and support revenue  including revenue from installation services  post contract customer support  project management  hosting services  saas  product warranties  and training services 
for multiple element arrangements for which we are unable to establish vsoe  of one or more elements  we use various available indicators of fair value and apply our best judgment to reasonably classify the arrangement revenue into product revenue and service and support revenue

backlog the delivery cycles of most of our products are generally very short  ranging from days to several months  with the exception of certain projects with multiple deliverables over longer periods of time 
therefore  we do not view backlog as a meaningful indicator of future business activity and do not consider it a meaningful financial metric for evaluating our business 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of cash is the collection of proceeds from the sale of products and services to our customers  including cash periodically collected in advance of delivery or performance 
in april  we entered into the credit agreement and terminated the credit agreement 
the credit agreement included a term loan facility  with an outstanding balance of million at january   and a million revolving line of credit  which was unused at january  on march   the credit agreement was replaced by the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement includes a term loan facility  with an outstanding balance of million at march   and a million revolving credit facility  which was unused at march  further discussion of our credit agreements appears below  under credit agreements 
our primary recurring use of cash is payment of our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee related expenses  such as compensation and benefits  as well as general operating expenses for marketing  facilities and overhead costs  and capital expenditures 
we also utilize cash for debt service under our credit agreements and periodically for business acquisitions 
cash generated from operations is our primary source of operating liquidity  and we believe that internally generated cash flows are sufficient to support our current business operations  including debt service and capital expenditure requirements 
as discussed earlier under recent developments  on february   we completed the cti merger  which eliminated cti majority ownership in and control of us 
the cti merger was accomplished through an exchange of new shares of our common stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of cti common stock 
other than the payment of professional fees and other transaction expenses  no cash was used in the cti merger 

table of contents although we did not complete any business acquisitions during the year ended january   we have historically expanded our business in part by investing in strategic growth initiatives  including acquisitions of products  technologies  and businesses 
we have used cash as consideration for substantially all of our historical business acquisitions  including million of net cash expended for business acquisitions during the year ended january  to the extent that we continue this strategy  our future cash requirements and liquidity may be impacted 
we may utilize external capital sources  including debt and equity  to supplement our internally generated sources of liquidity as necessary and if available 
we also may consider initiatives to modify the debt and equity components of our current capitalization  as we did in march by entering into the amended credit agreement  which amended and restated the credit agreement  or as we did in february by completing the cti merger 
a considerable portion of our operating income is earned outside the united states 
cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash and bank time deposits including any long term portions held by our subsidiaries outside the united states were million and million as of january  and  respectively  and are generally used to fund the subsidiaries operating requirements and to invest in company growth initiatives  including business acquisitions 
we currently do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations for the next months and for the foreseeable future 
should other circumstances arise whereby we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our domestic operations  or should we otherwise consider it in our best interests  we could repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions  which could result in higher effective tax rates 
we have not provided for deferred taxes on the excess of the amount for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in our foreign subsidiaries because we currently plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the united states 
in the past  we have periodically reported a working capital deficit current liabilities in excess of current assets  due largely to the impact of changes in our deferred revenue balances 
because deferred revenue is not a cash settled liability  working capital in this case may not be a meaningful indicator of our liquidity 
we believe our liquidity is better measured and assessed by our operating cash flow 
the following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and bank time deposits  short term investments and long term debt as of january  and january  in thousands cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and bank time deposits short term investments long term debt at january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  an increase of million from million at january  our operating activities generated million of cash during the year ended january   which was partially offset by million of cash used in investing and financing activities during this period

we also purchased million of short term investments during this year 
during the years ended january  and  our funds were held entirely in cash and cash equivalents and we therefore did not make any purchases of short term investments during those years

the amended credit agreement has increased our long term debt obligations  including projected future interest  from approximately million at january  to approximately million at march  this increase results primarily from the impact of the larger term loan under the amended credit agreement compared to the term loan under the credit agreement  partially offset by the impact of a lower projected interest rate under the amended credit agreement

recent accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements implemented in june  the fasb issued amended standards regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
these amendments eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity and require the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in december  the fasb updated this guidance to indefinitely defer the requirement to present items that are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to net income separately with their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
this guidance does not change the items that must be reported within other comprehensive income or the criteria for determining when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this guidance was effective for us on february  and has been applied retrospectively  as required by the standards 
other than the change in presentation  adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance to amend existing requirements for fair value measurements and disclosures 
the guidance expands the disclosure requirements around fair value measurements categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the level in the fair value hierarchy of items that are not measured at fair value but whose fair value must be disclosed 
it also clarifies and expands upon existing requirements for fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities as well as instruments classified in stockholders equity 
this guidance was effective for us on february   and its adoption did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements to be implemented in july  the fasb issued amended standards to simplify how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment which are intended to improve consistency in impairment testing requirements among long lived asset categories 
these amended standards permit an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
for assets in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing 
the amended guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect these new standards to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued amended standards regarding disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of aoci 
these amended standards require the disclosure of information about the amounts reclassified out of aoci by component  and in addition  require disclosure  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  of significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
these amended standards do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements  and is effective for us on february  we do not expect these new standards to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial condition due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
to manage the volatility relating to interest rate and foreign currency risks  we periodically enter into derivative instruments including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements 
it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet our risk management objectives 
we use derivative instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks and do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk on our debt 
table of contents on march   we entered into an amendment and restatement agreement with the lenders under the credit agreement providing for the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement provides for million of senior secured credit facilities  comprised of a million term loan maturing in september and a million revolving credit facility maturing in march  subject to increase up to a maximum increase of million and reduction from time to time according to the terms of the amended credit agreement 
the majority of the proceeds of the term loan under the amended credit agreement were used to repay all million of outstanding term loan borrowings under the credit agreement at the closing date of the amended credit agreement 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement revolving credit facility at the closing date 
loans under the amended credit agreement bear interest  payable quarterly or  in the case of eurodollar loans with an interest period of three months or shorter  at the end of any interest period  at a per annum rate of  at our election a in the case of eurodollar loans  the adjusted libo rate plus or  if our corporate credit ratings are bb and ba or better  
the adjusted libo rate is the greater of i per annum and ii the product of the libo rate and statutory reserves both as defined in the amended credit agreement  and b in the case of base rate loans  the base rate plus or  if our corporate credit ratings are bb and ba or better  
the base rate is the greatest of i the administrative agent prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate as defined in the amended credit agreement plus and iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period plus 
because the interest rates applicable to borrowings under the amended credit agreement are variable  we are exposed to market risk from changes in the underlying index rates  which affect our cost of borrowing 
the periodic interest rate on the term loan under the amended credit agreement is currently a function of several factors  most importantly the libo rate and the applicable interest rate margin 
however  borrowings are subject to a libo rate floor in the interest rate calculation  which currently reduces the likelihood of increases in the periodic interest rate  because current short term libo rates are well below 
although the periodic interest rate may still fluctuate based upon our corporate credit ratings  which determine the interest rate margin  changes in short term libo rates will not impact the calculation unless those rates increase above 
based upon our borrowings as of the march  closing date of the amended credit agreement  for each increase in the applicable libo rate above  our annual interest payments would increase by approximately million 
we had utilized a pay fixed receive variable interest rate swap agreement to partially mitigate the variable interest rate risk associated with the credit agreement 
we terminated that agreement in july we may consider utilizing interest rate swap agreements  or other agreements intended to mitigate variable interest rate risk  in the future 
interest rate risk on our investments we invest in cash  cash equivalents  bank time deposits and marketable debt securities 
interest rate changes could result in an increase or decrease in interest income we generate from these interest bearing assets 
our cash  cash equivalents  bank time deposits and marketable debt securities are primarily maintained at high credit quality financial institutions around the world 
we have not invested in marketable debt securities with remaining maturities in excess of three months or in equity securities during the three year period ended january   but may do so in the future as permitted under our investment guidelines 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk 
we have investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of january  and  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million and million  respectively  consisting of demand deposits  bank time deposits with maturities of three months or less  money market accounts  and marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of three months or less 
at such dates we also held million and million  respectively  of cash equivalents which were restricted and were not available for general operating use 
these balances primarily represent short term deposits to secure bank guarantees in connection with sales contracts 
the amounts of these deposits can vary depending upon the terms of the underlying contracts 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio 
table of contents assuming  during the year ending january   average short term interest rates increase or decrease by basis points relative to average rates realized during the year ended january  such a change would cause our projected interest income from cash  cash equivalents  and bank time deposits to increase or decrease by approximately million  assuming a similar level of investments in the year ending january  as in the year ended january  due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents  time deposits  money market accounts and marketable debt securities  their carrying values approximate their market values and are not generally subject to price risk due to fluctuations in interest rates 
see note  investments to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information regarding our short term investments 
foreign currency exchange risk the functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is the applicable local currency  of which the notable exceptions are our subsidiaries in israel and canada  whose functional currencies are the us dollar 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes 
if there are changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars results in a gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
our international operations subject us to risks associated with currency fluctuations 
while most of our revenue and expenses are denominated in us dollars  we do have significant portions of our operating expenses  primarily labor expenses  that are denominated in the local currencies where our foreign operations are located  primarily israel  the united kingdom  germany  and canada 
we also generate some of our revenue in foreign currencies  mainly the euro and british pound sterling 
as a result  our consolidated us dollar operating results are subject to the potentially adverse impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and the other currencies in which we transact 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the respective entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that result in gains or losses 
we recorded million  million  and million of net foreign currency gains for the years ended january    and  respectively 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted payroll and payroll related expenses denominated in israeli shekels and canadian dollars 
these contracts are generally limited to durations of approximately months or less 
our owned joint venture in singapore enters into foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted us dollar payments to its suppliers 
these contracts are generally limited to durations of approximately months or less 
we have also periodically entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage exposures resulting from forecasted customer collections denominated in currencies other than the respective entity s functional currency and exposures from cash  cash equivalents and short term investments denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
during the years ended january    and  we realized net losses of million  million  and million  respectively  on settlements of foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
we had million of net unrealized gains on outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of january   with notional amounts totaling million 
we had million of net unrealized gains on outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of january   with notional amounts totaling million 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of january  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar  and assumes no changes in interest rates 
a increase in the relative value of the us dollar would decrease the estimated fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives by approximately million 
conversely  a decrease in the relative value of the us dollar would increase the estimated the fair value of these financial instruments by approximately million 
the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are multinational commercial banks 
while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material  disruption in the global financial markets in recent years has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business 
a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a 
table of contents result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs
