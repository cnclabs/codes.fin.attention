overview we are a global contract research and manufacturing organization that provides customers fully integrated drug discovery  development  and manufacturing services 
we supply a broad range of services and technologies that support the discovery and development of pharmaceutical products and the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients api and drug product for existing and experimental new drugs 
with locations in the united states  europe  and asia  we maintain geographic proximity and flexible cost models 
we have also historically leveraged our drug discovery expertise to execute on several internal drug discovery programs  which have progressed to the development candidate stage and in some cases into phase i clinical development 
we have successfully partnered certain programs and are actively seeking to out license our remaining programs to strategic partners for further development 
we continue to integrate our research and manufacturing facilities worldwide  increasing our access to key global markets and enabling us to provide our customers with a flexible combination of high quality services and competitive cost structures to meet their individual outsourcing needs 
our service offerings range from early stage discovery through manufacturing and formulation across us  europe and asia 
we believe that the ability to partner with a single provider is of significant benefit to our customers as we are able to provide them with a more efficient transition of experimental compounds through the research and development process  ultimately reducing the time and cost involved in bringing these compounds from concept to market 
compounds discovered and or developed in our contract research facilities can then be more easily transitioned to production at our large scale manufacturing facilities for use in clinical trials and  ultimately  commercial sales if the product meets regulatory approval 
additionally  we offer our customers a fully integrated manufacturing process for sterile injectable drugs 
this includes the development and manufacture of the api  the design of the criteria to formulate the api into an injectable drug product  and the manufacture of the final drug product 
we continue to make investments to build and recover our formulation business  as we believe this type of business has significant potential in the drug product world driven by the growth in biologically based compounds which are formulated manufactured on an aseptic basis 
in addition to providing our customers our hybrid services model for outsourcing  we now offer the option of insourcing 
with our world class expertise in managing high performing groups of scientists  this option allows us to embed our scientists into the customer s facility allowing the customer to cost effectively leverage their unused laboratory space 
as our customers continue to seek innovative new strategies for r d efficiency and productivity  we are aggressively realigning our business and resources to address their needs 
to that end  we have launched amri smartsourcing  a cross functional approach that maximizes the strengths of both insourcing and outsourcing  by leveraging amri s people  know how  facilities  expertise and global project management to provide exactly what is needed across the discovery or development process 
we have also streamlined our sales and marketing organization to optimize cross selling opportunities and enhanced our commitment to quality with the appointment of key personnel at our burlington aseptic services facility  both underscoring our dedication to client service 
our improved organizational structure  combined with more focused marketing efforts  should enable us to continue to drive long term growth and profitability 
in  we made a decision to cease activities related to our internal proprietary compound discovery r d programs 
although we halted our proprietary r d activities  we continue to believe there are additional opportunities to partner our proprietary compounds or programs to create value  as we have seen a renewed commitment by pharmaceutical companies for innovation both internally and through licensing 
our goal is to partner these compounds or programs in return for a combination of up front license fees  milestone payments and recurring royalty payments if any compound based on our intellectual property is successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
in march  we approved a restructuring plan that ceased all operations at our budapest  hungary facility effective march  in november  we approved a restructuring plan to cease all operations at our bothell  wa facility 
the goal of these restructuring activities is to advance our continued strategy of increasing global competitiveness and remaining diligent in managing costs by improving efficiency and customer service and by realigning resources to meet shifting customer demand and market preferences 
our total revenue for was million  including million from our contract service business and million from royalties on sales of allegra telfast and certain products sold by actavis  inc actavis 
we generated million in cash from operations  and we used million for capital expenditures on our facilities and equipment  primarily related to maintaining and upgrading our us facilities 
we recorded a net loss of million in  largely the result of million of long lived asset impairment charges and million of restructuring charges 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash and million in bank and other related debt 
results of operations operating segment data we have organized our sales  marketing and production activities into the discovery  drug development and small scale manufacturing dds and large scale manufacturing lsm segments based on the criteria set forth in asc  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we rely on an internal management accounting system to report results of these segments 
the accounting system includes revenue and cost information by segment 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the information we receive from this internal system 
the dds segment includes activities such as drug lead discovery  optimization  drug development and small scale commercial manufacturing 
the lsm segment includes pilot to commercial scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates  sterile syringe and vial filling  and high potency and controlled substance manufacturing 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers 
our contract revenues for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in thousands dds    lsm    total    dds contract revenues for the year ended december  remained consistent with amounts recognized in the same period in including lower contract revenue for our biology discovery services and development and small scale manufacturing services  offset in part by an increase in our us chemistry discovery services 
we currently expect dds contract revenue for full year to increase from amounts recognized in primarily due to an increase in demand for our us chemistry services  offset in part by a decrease in our biology services 
dds contract revenues decreased for the year ended december  from the same period in primarily due to lower contract revenue from our discovery services of million  offset in part by an increase in our development and small scale manufacturing services of million 
the decrease in discovery services contract revenue was primarily due to lower demand for our us medicinal chemistry services  partially offset by higher demand for our discovery services at our asia locations 
the increases in contract revenue from development and small scale manufacturing services were attributable to higher demand for our chemistry development services 
lsm contract revenue significantly increased for the year ended december  from the same period in as a result of higher commercial manufacturing services at our rensselaer  ny facility  as well as continued improvement at our uk facility 
we currently expect continued growth in lsm contract revenue for full year due to strong demand for our commercial manufacturing services 
lsm contract revenue increased for the year ended december  from the same period in as a result of higher commercial and api development manufacturing shipments from our rensselaer  ny facility  as well as increased intermediate manufacturing in our aurangabad  india facility as compared to the same period in recurring royalty revenue year ended december  in thousands the largest portion of our recurring royalties are based on the worldwide sales of allegra telfast  as well as on sales of sanofi over the counter otc product and authorized generics 
additionally  beginning in the third quarter of we earned recurring royalty revenue in conjunction with a development and supply agreement with actavis at the company s rensselaer  ny manufacturing facility 
recurring royalties increased during the year ended december  from the same period in due to the receipt of actavis royalties of million 
this increase was offset in part by a million decrease in royalties recognized from the sales of prescription allegra which was primarily due to decreased sales in japan in the first quarter of as a result of a less severe allergy season 
we currently expect full year recurring royalties to slightly increase over amounts recognized in primarily due to incremental royalties from actavis  partially offset by lower allegra royalties 
recurring royalties slightly increased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to a significant increase in sales of prescription allegra in japan  partially offset by a decrease in royalties recognized from the sale of allegra products in the us the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues  earnings and operating cash flows 
we continue to develop our business in an effort to supplement the revenues  earnings and operating cash flows that have historically been provided by allegra telfast royalties 
milestone revenue milestone revenue is earned for achieving milestones included in licensing and research agreements with certain of our partners 
milestone revenues were as follows year ended december  in thousands milestone revenue received during the year ended december  was recognized primarily in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms for advancing a fourth compound into preclinical development 
milestone revenue of million received during the year ended december  was recognized in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms and was specifically based on meeting a phase ii clinical trial milestone of an amri compound licensed exclusively to bms 
no milestone revenue was recorded during the year ended december  cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue consists of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees  chemicals  depreciation and other indirect project related costs 
cost of contract revenue for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in thousands dds    lsm    total    dds gross contract margin lsm gross contract margin total gross contract margin dds contract revenue gross margin percentages increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in these increases are primarily due to cost savings initiatives taken in our u 
s chemistry operations in  as well as the impact of the closure of our hungarian operations in  offset in part by lower demand for our us biology and development services in relation to our fixed costs 
we currently expect dds contract margins for to improve over amounts recognized in due to cost savings initiatives in our global discovery services platform along with improved facility utilization 
lsm s contract revenue gross margin percentages improved for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase is primarily due to an increase in sales of higher margin products for our us manufacturing services  as well as an increase in capacity utilization at our large scale manufacturing facilities worldwide 
we currently expect continued improvement in lsm contract margins for driven by an increase in capacity utilization in relation to our fixed costs 
dds contract revenue gross margin percentages decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this resulted from lower demand for our discovery services in relation to our fixed costs 
lsm s contract revenue gross margin slightly decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to levels of fixed cost base at our burlington  ma facility as compared to its revenues due to the disruption at the facility resulting from the fda warning letter received in august  along with unutilized capacity at our amri uk facility 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in margins for our us api manufacturing services 
technology incentive award we maintain a technology development incentive plan  the purpose of which is to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology developments by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor or made a significant intellectual contribution 
to date  the royalties from allegra are the main driver of the awards 
accordingly  as the creator of the technology  the award is currently payable primarily to dr 
thomas d ambra  the chief executive officer and president of the company 
the incentive awards were as follows year ended december  in thousands we expect technology incentive award expense to generally fluctuate directionally and proportionately with fluctuations in allegra royalties in future periods 
technology incentive award expense decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to the decrease in allegra recurring royalty revenue as discussed above 
technology incentive award expense for the year ended december  remained consistent as compared to which reflected the relative consistency in allegra royalty revenue 
research and development research and development r d expense consists of compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary technology r d projects  costs of chemicals  materials  outsourced activities and other out of pocket costs and overhead costs 
during the fourth quarter of  the company made a decision to cease activities related to its internal discovery research and development programs  excluding generic programs 
although we ceased our proprietary new compound r d activities  we continue to believe there are additional opportunities to partner these programs in return for appropriate consideration if our technology results in compounds that are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
in addition  r d activities continue at our large scale manufacturing facility related to the potential manufacture of new products  the development of processes for the manufacture of generic products with commercial potential  and the development of alternative manufacturing processes 
research and development expenses were as follows year ended december  in thousands r d expense for the year ended december  decreased to million as a result of our strategic decision during the fourth quarter of to cease r d operations related to our internal discovery research and development programs  excluding our generics program 
r d expenditures incurred during related primarily to developing new niche generic products and improving process efficiencies in our manufacturing plants 
based on our strategic decision to cease r d operations  we currently expect r d expense to be consistent with amounts recognized in research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an overall decrease in internal operating costs as we strategically managed our r d investments and continued to narrow the focus of r d spending on those programs with the highest licensing potential  as well as a decrease in clinical trial costs related to our oncology and obesity programs 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for sales  marketing  operational and administrative employees  professional service fees  marketing costs and costs related to facilities and information services 
sg a expenses were as follows year ended december  in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  remained relatively flat as compared to the same period in decreases in sg a resulting from ongoing actions related to cost savings were offset by non recurring executive transition costs 
we currently expect sg a expenses for to decrease from amounts recognized in due to on going cost saving actions partially offset by inflation 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased from the same period in this decrease was primarily attributable to nonrecurring acquisition costs and reductions in amri burlington remediation costs compared to the levels incurred in goodwill impairment year ended december  in thousands during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our dds operating segment due to a change in the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill to below its carrying value 
the change in the fair value of the segment was primarily attributable to significantly lower than forecasted demand for contract services in  which resulted in a decrease in management s long term estimates of operating results and cash flows for the segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our lsm operating segment due to a change in the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill to below its carrying value 
the change in the fair value of the segment was primarily attributable to the fact that in the fourth quarter of several events occurred in the lsm segment that significantly impacted our expected future performance for this segment 
our amri uk facility was notified of an unplanned significant reduction in demand for a key commercial product  which had historically represented a significant amount of annual revenues at the site 
in addition  the fda warning letter issued to our amri burlington facility was expected to have both continued negative short term financial impact during the remediation process  as well as delaying the planned integration of the amri burlington business into our overall lsm platform and the forecasted resulting growth in the long term 
property and equipment impairment year ended december  in thousands during  we recorded long lived asset impairment charges of million in our dds segment in order to further optimize the company s location footprint and cease operations at our budapest  hungary and bothell  washington facilities 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded long lived asset impairment charges of million in our dds segment associated with the company s decision to terminate its lease and exit one of its us facilities as part of the overall initiative to reduce the company workforce  right size capacity  and reduce operating costs 
in  we recorded long lived asset impairment charges of million in our dds segment 
as a result of realigning some of the amri us operating activities  the company evaluated the future economic benefit expected to be generated from the revised operating activities in this facility against the carrying value of the facility s property and equipment and determined that these assets were impaired 
additionally  we recorded a long lived asset impairment charge of million in our lsm segment upon determining that the carrying value of certain assets at our amri india location used in the manufacturing of generic products was not recoverable based on projections of future revenues and cash flows expected to be derived from the use of these assets 
intangible impairment year ended december  in thousands in the fourth quarter of  we identified patent assets relating to technologies that we no longer expect to derive value from as a result of the company s decision to cease internal r d activities 
we recorded an intangible impairment charge of million in our dds segment in conjunction with this review of our patent portfolio 
restructuring charges year ended december  in thousands during  we approved restructuring plans to cease all operations at our budapest  hungary  and bothell  wa facilities 
the goal of these restructuring activities is to advance our continued strategy of increasing global competitiveness and to remain diligent in managing costs by improving efficiency and customer service and by realigning resources to meet shifting customer demand and market preferences 
additionally  we intend to expand and better integrate our in vitro biology services with the total drug discovery service platform and to further optimize the company s location footprint 
in connection with these actions  we recorded restructuring charges of million in we exited the budapest  hungary facility in the third quarter of and are in the process of resolving the termination of the lease 
in december  we initiated a restructuring plan at one of our us locations which included actions to reduce our workforce  right size capacity  and reduce operating costs 
these actions were implemented to better align the business to current and expected market conditions and are expected to improve our overall cost competitiveness and increase cash flow generation 
the workforce reduction primarily affected certain positions associated with our elimination of internal r d activities 
as a result of the workforce reduction  we have terminated the lease of one of our us facilities which will result in a reduction in annual operating expenses related to this facility 
as a result of this restructuring  we recorded a restructuring charge in the dds operating segment of million in the fourth quarter of and million in in may  we initiated a restructuring of our amri us locations 
as part of our strategy to increase global competitiveness and continue to be diligent in managing costs  we implemented cost reduction activities at our operations in the us these cost reduction activities included a reduction in the us workforce  as well as the suspension of operations at one of our research laboratory facilities in rensselaer  new york 
employees and equipment from this facility were consolidated into other nearby company operations 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in this charge included lease termination charges of million net of estimated sublease income  termination benefits and personnel realignment costs of million and facility and other costs of million 
anticipated cash outflow related to the restructuring activities for is approximately million 
arbitration charge year ended december  in thousands on august   amri rensselaer notified one of its suppliers that it was cancelling a purchase agreement between the parties pursuant to a hardship clause of the agreement 
our supplier commenced arbitration in september with international centre for dispute resolution icdr seeking damages for amri rensselaer s alleged wrongful repudiation of the agreement 
on october  the icdr issued an arbitration award in favor of our supplier against amri rensselaer and awarded damages of million plus interest at the rate of starting from august  amri accrued million for the award and related interest expense in the year ended december  on march   amri rensselaer and our supplier entered into a settlement and supply agreement agreement which served to settle the arbitral award and other legal proceedings related to the arbitral award that were pending 
the agreement required amri rensselaer to pay million to our supplier and provide a letter of credit to secure the remainder of the arbitral award plus accrued interest 
the letter of credit will reduce quarterly based on certain volume purchase milestones 
the agreement also re establishes the supply relationship between amri and our supplier through with mutually beneficial terms 
as the letter of credit is reduced  the company reverses the allocated portion of the accrued charge through a reduction in the carrying cost of the associated inventory 
the maximum amount to be reversed is million through as of december   the remaining arbitration reserve is million 
arbitration charges of million in represented accrued interest expense related to the award prior to the arbitration settlement 
interest expense income  net year ended december  in thousands interest expense interest income interest expense income  net interest expense decreased for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in the prior year primarily due to lower borrowing costs under the company s april credit agreement 
interest expense increased for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in primarily due to borrowing costs associated with the renegotiation of the company s credit agreement entered into in interest income decreased for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in due to a decrease in the amount of interest bearing assets 
interest income decreased for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in primarily due to the decrease in the average balances of interest bearing cash and investments held during the year 
other expense income  net year ended december  in thousands other expense increased for the year ended december  from income for the same period in primarily due to rates associated with foreign currency transactions  as well as costs associated with transitioning our financing to a new creditor during these amounts were partially offset by income from the settlement of contingencies associated with our amri uk and amri burlington acquisitions  along with income from insurance claims related to the remediation of the fda warning letter at our burlington facility 
other income for the year ended december  included income of million related to settlement of contingencies associated with the amri uk and amri burlington acquisitions and income related to the fluctuation in exchange rates associated with foreign currency translations 
these amounts were offset in part by deferred financing amortization expense 
income tax expense benefit year ended december  in thousands income tax expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to income tax benefit of million for the same period in due primarily to improved pre tax income at the company s us locations and the composition of pre tax income or losses in relation to the applicable tax rates at our various locations worldwide 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to income tax benefit of million for the same period in this decrease in income tax benefit is due to a decrease in pre tax loss  as well as the composition of pre tax losses in relation to the applicable tax rates at our various locations worldwide 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows and proceeds from borrowings 
during  we generated cash of million from operating activities 
during  cash used in investing activities was million  primarily for the acquisition and installation of equipment 
additionally  we used million for financing activities  relating primarily to pledging million of cash to collateralize our revolving line of credit issued in conjunction with our credit facility executed in april along with principal payments of long term debt  partially offset by net proceeds from the term loan issued under this agreement 
working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was million as of december   compared to million as of december  this is primarily due to an increase in both accounts receivable and inventories as a result of the growth in our business in total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to growth  maintenance and upgrading our existing facilities 
for  we expect to incur to million in capital expenditures primarily relating to the growth and maintenance of our existing facilities 
in april  the company entered into a million credit facility consisting of a year  million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
the company used a portion of the initial proceeds from borrowings against the term loan to repay all amounts due under its prior credit agreement 
as of december   the company had no amounts outstanding under the line of credit and million of outstanding letters of credit secured by this line of credit 
the amount available to be borrowed under the revolving line of credit at december  was million 
upon entering into the credit agreement in april  the company is required to maintain a million restricted cash balance to partially collateralize the revolving line of credit 
in conjunction with an amendment to the credit agreement dated december   the restricted cash requirement will be directly reduced by the amount of principal payments made on the term loan beginning in may borrowings under this agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate equal to i in the case of the term loan  the sum of a an interest rate equal to daily three month libor  plus b  and ii in the case of advances under the revolving line of credit  the sum of a an interest rate equal to daily three month libor  plus b 
as of december   the interest rate on the outstanding term loan was the credit facility contains financial covenants  including certain net cash flow requirements for  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio commencing in and extending for the remaining term of the agreement  maximum quarterly and year to date capital expenditures  minimum monthly domestic unrestricted cash and maximum average monthly cash reserves held at international locations 
as of december   the company was in compliance with its current financial covenants 
working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was million as of december   compared to million as of december  this decrease includes a payment of million associated with the company s settlement of the arbitration matter with a supplier and million used for capital expenditures 
total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to maintenance and expansion of our existing facilities 
during  we used cash of million for operating activities and cash provided by investing activities was million  resulting primarily from net proceeds from the sale or maturities of marketable securities of million offset in part by the use of million for the acquisition of property and equipment 
during  we used million for financing activities  relating primarily to payments made on our credit facilities 
we expect that additional future capital expansion and acquisition activities  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources

no estimate of payments after five years has been provided due to many uncertainties 
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
all of these estimates reflect our best judgment and are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
under different assumptions or conditions  it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change  which may result in future impairments of inventories  and long lived assets  as well as increased pension liabilities  the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities  among other effects
