information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference in this report 
we are primarily focused on providing financial services 
through our subsidiaries  we offer financial products and services to a market represented by credit risks that regulators classify as sub prime 
we traditionally have served our customers principally through our marketing and solicitation of credit card accounts and other credit products and our servicing of various receivables 
given the global financial crisis arising in  we worked with our third party financial institution partners to close substantially all of the credit card accounts underlying our credit card receivables portfolios in the only open credit card accounts underlying our credit card receivables are those generated through our credit card products in the uk several of our portfolios of credit card receivables underlying now closed accounts are encumbered by non recourse structured financings  and for some of these portfolios  our only remaining economic interest is the servicing compensation that we receive as an offset against our servicing costs given that the likely future collections on the portfolios are insufficient to allow for full repayment of the financings 
we have been successful in partnering with certain financing partners to purchase the debt underlying two of our portfolios 
beyond the aforementioned activities within our credit cards and other investments segment  we are applying the experiences and infrastructure associated with our historic credit card offerings to other credit product offerings  including private label merchant credit whereby we partner with retailers to provide credit at the point of sale to their customers who may have been declined under traditional financing options 
we specialize in providing this second look credit service in various industries across the united states us 
using our global infrastructure and technology platform  we also provide loan servicing activities  including underwriting  marketing  customer service and collections operations for third parties 
lastly  through our credit cards and other investments segment  we are engaged in limited investment activities in ancillary finance  technology and other businesses as we seek to build new products and relationships that could allow for greater utilization of our expertise and infrastructure 
within our auto finance segment  our car subsidiary operations principally purchase and or service loans secured by automobiles from or for and also provide floor plan financing for a pre qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy here  pay here used car business 
we purchase the auto loans at a discount and with dealer retentions or holdbacks that provide risk protection 
also within our auto finance segment  we are collecting on portfolios of auto finance receivables that we previously originated through franchised and independent auto dealers in connection with prior business activities 
as suggested above  we manage our business activities through two reportable segments credit cards and other investments  and auto finance 
we further describe our segment operations below 
see  also  note  segment reporting  to our consolidated financial statements included herein for segment specific financial data 
the most significant business changes or events for us during the year ended december  were our receipt of million from a lender to compensate us for excess costs we incurred for the benefit of the lender in servicing a portfolio that collateralized the lender s loan to us  the september repurchase of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate cost of million  pursuant to a tender offer  the august sale of our investments in previously charged off receivables segment  including its balance transfer card operations the post card issuance activities of which were historically reflected within our credit cards and other investments segment  to flexpoint fund ii  lp for a total of million in fixed and contingent consideration such transaction resulting in a net gain on sale after related expenses and recognition of the contingent consideration we earned in november of million as reflected within our income from discontinued operations category on our consolidated statement of operations  and our may repayment to investors in our convertible senior notes of million in face amount of such then outstanding notes 

table of contents in the current environment  the principal recurring cash flows we receive within our credit cards and other investments segment are those associated with i servicing compensation  ii distributions from one of our equity method investees that in march purchased and now holds all of the outstanding notes issued out of our uk portfolio structured financing trust  and iii unencumbered credit card receivables portfolios that have already generated enough cash to allow for the repayment of their underlying structured financing facilities 
although we are closely monitoring and managing our liquidity position and in recent years have significantly reduced our overhead infrastructure which was built to accommodate higher account originations and managed receivables levels  we are maintaining our global infrastructure and incurring heightened overhead and other costs in so doing as we pursue new product offerings that we believe have the potential to grow into our infrastructure and allow for long term shareholder returns 
subject to the availability of growth capital at attractive terms and pricing  our shareholders should expect us to continue to evaluate and pursue a variety of activities  including the acquisition of additional credit card receivables portfolios  and potentially other financial assets that are complementary to our financially underserved credit products and services business  investments in other assets or businesses that are not necessarily financial services assets or businesses  repurchases of our convertible senior notes and other debt or our outstanding common stock  and servicing credit card receivables and other assets for third parties and in which we have limited or no equity interests to allow us to leverage our expertise and infrastructure 
credit cards and other investments segment 
our credit cards and other investments segment includes our continuing activities relating to investments in and servicing of our various credit card receivables portfolios  as well as other investments and credit products that generally use much of the same infrastructure as our credit card operations 
one such product is our private label merchant credit product  whereby we partner with retailers to provide credit and in some cases second look credit at the point of sale to their customers 
additionally  we include within our credit cards and other investments segment certain limited investment activities in ancillary finance  technology and other businesses as we seek to build new products and relationships that could allow for greater utilization of our credit cards and other investments segment expertise and infrastructure 
substantially all of the credit card accounts underlying our credit card receivables and portfolios have been closed to new cardholder purchases and hence credit card receivables growth since however  as described in more detail below  we do have a growing number of open credit card accounts in the uk our credit card and other operations are heavily regulated  and over time we change how we conduct our operations either in response to regulation or in keeping with our goal of leading the industry in the application of consumer friendly practices 
we have made several significant changes to our practices over the past several years  and because our account management practices are evolutionary and dynamic  it is possible that we may make further changes to these practices  some of which may produce positive  and others of which may produce adverse  effects on our operating results and financial position 
customers at the lower end of the fico scoring range intrinsically have higher loss rates than do customers at the higher end of the fico scoring range 
as a result  we have priced our products to reflect this higher loss rate 
as such  our products are subject to greater regulatory scrutiny than the products of prime lenders who can price their credit products at much lower levels than we can 
see consumer and debtor protection laws and regulations credit cards and other investments segment and item a  risk factors 
as is customary in our industry  we historically financed most of our credit card receivables through the asset backed securitization markets 
these markets worsened significantly in  and the level of advance rates or leverage we can achieve against credit receivable assets in the current asset backed securitization markets is far below levels 
considering this reality  along with a us regulatory environment in which sub prime credit card lending returns on assets are significantly lower than they were before  we have concluded that we cannot achieve our desired returns on equity through us credit card lending 
we continue  however  to originate credit cards in the uk because we believe the uk environment to be more favorable than the us toward possible significant credit card origination growth in the future 
additinally  we believe that our growing portfolio of private label merchant credit receivables is generating and will continue to generate attractive returns on assets  thereby allowing us to secure debt financing under terms and conditions including advance rates and pricing that will allow us to achieve our desired returns on equity 
auto finance segment 
our auto finance segment historically has included a variety of auto sales and lending activities 
our original platform  car  acquired in april  purchases auto loans at a discount  services auto loans for a fee and provides floor plan financing  its customer base includes a nationwide network of pre qualified independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy here  pay here used car business 
we also historically owned substantially all of jras  a buy here  pay here dealer we acquired in and operated from that time until our disposition of certain jras operating assets in the first quarter of subsequent to the first quarter of  our only remaining jras asset is the portfolio of auto finance receivables that it had originated while under our ownership 
lastly  our acc platform acquired during historically purchased retail installment contracts from franchised car dealers 
we ceased origination efforts within the acc platform during and outsourced the collection of its portfolio of auto finance receivables 
the auto finance receivables of both the jras and the acc portfolios are liquidating with collections and charge offs  and the effects of these liquidating receivables portfolios on our results of operations are diminishing with each successive financial reporting period 
in our car operations  we generate revenues on purchased loans through interest earned on the face value of the installment agreements combined with discounts on loans purchased 
we generally earn discount income over the life of the applicable loan 
additionally  we generate revenues from servicing loans on behalf of dealers for a portion of actual collections and by providing back up servicing for others similar quality securitized assets 
we offer a number of other products to our network of buy here  pay here dealers including our floor plan financing offering  but the vast majority of our activities are represented by our purchases of auto loans at discounts and our servicing of auto loans for a fee 
our car operations currently serve more than dealers in states 
these operations are performing well in the current environment achieving consistent profitability and generating positive cash flows with modest growth 

table of contents how do we maintain the accounts and mitigate our risks credit cards and other investments segment 
we manage account activity using credit behavioral scoring  credit file data and our proprietary risk evaluation systems 
these strategies include the management of transaction authorizations  account renewals  over limit accounts  credit line modifications and collection programs 
we use an adaptive control system to translate our strategies into account management processes 
the system enables us to develop and test multiple strategies simultaneously  which allows us to continually refine our account management activities 
we have incorporated our proprietary risk scores into the control system  in addition to standard credit behavior scores used widely in the industry  in order to segment  evaluate and manage the accounts 
we believe that by combining external credit file data along with historical and current customer activity  we are able to better predict the true risk associated with current and delinquent accounts 
for credit card accounts that are open to cardholder purchases currently only those accounts opened under programs within the uk  we monitor authorizations  and we limit customer credit availability for transaction types we believe present higher risks  such as foreign transactions  cash advances  etc 
we generally seek to manage credit lines to reward financially underserved customers who are performing well and to mitigate losses from delinquent customer segments  and we periodically review accounts exhibiting favorable credit characteristics for credit line increases 
we also employ strategies to reduce otherwise open credit lines for customers demonstrating indicators of increased credit or bankruptcy risk 
data relating to account performance are captured and loaded into our proprietary database for ongoing analysis 
we adjust account management strategies as necessary  based on the results of such analyses 
additionally  we use industry standard fraud detection software to manage the portfolio 
we route accounts to manual work queues and suspend charging privileges if the transaction based fraud models indicate a high probability of fraudulent card use 
auto finance segment 
our car operations manage credit quality and loss mitigation at the dealer portfolio level through the implementation of dealer specific loss reserve accounts 
in most instances  the reserve accounts are cross collateralized across all business presented by any single dealer 
car monitors performance at the dealer portfolio level by product type to adjust pricing or the reserve account or to determine if the dealer is to be excluded from our account purchase program 
car applies specific purchase guidelines based upon each product offering  and we establish delegated approval authorities to assist in the monitoring of transactions during the loan acquisition process 
dealers are subject to specific approval criteria  and individual accounts typically are verified for accuracy before  during and after the acquisition process 
dealer portfolios across the business segment are monitored and compared against expected collections and peer dealer performance 
monitoring of dealer pool vintages  delinquencies and loss ratios helps determine past performance and expected future results  which are used to adjust pricing and reserve requirements 
our car operations manage risk through diversifying their receivables among multiple dealers 
how do we collect from our customers credit cards and other investments segment 
the goal of the collections process is to collect as much of the money that is owed to us in the most cost effective and customer friendly manner possible 
to this end  we employ the traditional cross section of letters and telephone calls to encourage payment 
however  recognizing that our objective is to maximize the amount collected  we also will offer customers flexibility with respect to the application of payments in order to encourage larger or prompter payments 
for instance  in certain cases we vary from our general payment application priority ie  of applying payments first to finance charges  then to fees  and then to principal by agreeing to apply payments first to principal and then to finance charges and fees or by agreeing to provide payments or credits of finance charges and principal to induce or in exchange for an appropriate customer payment 
application of payments in this manner also permits our collectors to assess real time the degree to which a customer s payments over the life of an account have covered the principal credit extensions to the customer 
this allows our collectors to readily identify our potential economic loss associated with the charge off of a particular account ie  the excess of principal loaned to the customer over payments received back from the customer throughout the life of the account 
with this information  our collectors work cooperatively with our customers in a way intended to best protect us from economic loss on the customer relationship 
our selection of collection techniques  including  for example  the order in which we apply payments or the provision of payments or credits to induce or in exchange for customer payment  impacts the statistical performance of our portfolios that we reflect under the credit cards and other investments segment caption within item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we consider management s experience in operating professional collection agencies  coupled with our proprietary systems  to be a competitive advantage in minimizing delinquencies and charge offs 
our collectors employ various and evolving tools when engaging with our customers  and they routinely test and evaluate new tools in their drive toward improving our collections with a greater degree of efficiency 
these tools include programs under which we may reduce or eliminate a customer s annual percentage rate apr or waive a certain amount of accrued fees  provided the customer makes a minimum number or amount of payments 
in some instances  we may agree to match a customer s payments  for example  with a commensurate payment or reduction of finance charges or waiver of fees 
in other situations  we may actually settle with customers and adjust their finance charges and fees  for example  based on their commitment and their follow through on their commitment to pay certain portions of the balances they owe 
our collectors may also decrease a customer s minimum payment under certain collection programs 
additionally  we employ re aging techniques as discussed below 
we also may occasionally use our marketing group to assist in determining various programs to assist in the collection process 
moreover  we willingly participate in the consumer credit counseling service cccs program by waiving a certain percentage of a customer s debt that is considered our fair share under the cccs program 
all of our programs are utilized based on the degree of economic success they achieve 

table of contents we constantly are monitoring and adapting our collection strategies  techniques  technology and training to optimize our efforts to reduce delinquencies and charge offs 
we use our systems to develop these proprietary collection strategies and techniques  which we employ in our operations 
we analyze the output from these systems to identify the strategies and techniques that we believe are most likely to result in curing a delinquent account in the most cost effective manner  rather than treating all accounts the same based on the mere passage of time 
our collection strategies have included utilizing both internal and third party collectors and creating a competitive process of rewarding the most effective and efficient group of collectors from within our system and among third party agencies 
we have divided our portfolios into various groups that are statistically equivalent and have provided these groups of accounts to our various internal and external collection resources 
we compare the results of the collectors against one another to determine which techniques and which collection groups are producing the best results 
as in all aspects of our risk management strategies  we compare the results of each of the above strategies with other collection strategies and devote resources to those strategies that yield the best results 
results are measured based on delinquency rates  expected losses and costs to collect 
existing strategies are then adjusted as suggested by these results 
management believes that maintaining the ongoing discipline of testing  measuring and adjusting collection strategies will result in minimized bad debt losses and operating expenses 
we believe this on going evaluation differs from the approach taken by the vast majority of credit grantors that implement collection strategies based on commonly accepted peer group practices 
we discontinue charging interest and fees for most of our credit products when loans and fees receivable become contractually or more days past due and in certain circumstances where it is necessary in order to avoid so called negative amortization  and we charge off loans and fees receivable when they become contractually more than days past due or within days of notification and confirmation of a customer s bankruptcy or death 
however  if a customer makes a payment greater than or equal to two minimum payments within a month of the charge off date  we may reconsider whether charge off status remains appropriate 
additionally  in some cases of death  receivables are not charged off if  with respect to the deceased customer s account  there is a surviving  contractually liable individual or an estate large enough to pay the debt in full 
our determination of whether an account is contractually past due is relevant to our delinquency and charge off data included under the credit cards and other investments segment caption within item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
various factors are relevant in analyzing whether an account is contractually past due ie  whether an account has not satisfied its minimum payment due requirement  which for us is the trigger for moving receivables through our various delinquency buckets and ultimately to charge off status 
we consider a cardholder s receivable to be delinquent if the cardholder fails to pay a minimum amount computed as the greater of a stated minimum payment or a fixed percentage of his or her statement balance for example to of the outstanding balance in some cases or in other cases of the outstanding balance plus any finance charges and late fees billed in the current cycle 
additionally  in an effort to increase the value of our account relationships  we re age customer accounts that meet applicable regulatory qualifications for re aging 
it is our policy to work cooperatively with customers demonstrating a willingness and ability to repay their indebtedness and who satisfy other criteria  but are unable to pay the entire past due amount 
generally  to qualify for re aging  an account must have been opened for at least nine months and may not be re aged more than once in a twelve month period or twice in a five year period 
in addition  an account on a workout program may qualify for one additional re age in a five year period 
the customer also must have made three consecutive minimum monthly payments or the equivalent cumulative amount in the last three billing cycles 
if a re aged account subsequently experiences payment defaults  it will again become contractually delinquent and will be charged off according to our regular charge off policy 
the practice of re aging an account may affect delinquencies and charge offs  potentially delaying or reducing such delinquencies and charge offs 
auto finance segment 
accounts that car purchases from approved dealers initially are collected by the originating branch or service center location using a combination of traditional collection techniques 
auto finance segment accounts that have been loaded into our data processing system are centrally serviced to leverage auto dialer processing for early stage collections 
the collection process includes contacting the customer by phone or mail  skip tracing and using starter interrupt devices to minimize delinquencies 
uncollectible accounts in our car operation generally are returned to the dealer under an agreement with the dealer to charge the balance on the account against the dealer s reserve account 
we generally do not repossess autos in our car operation as a result of the agreements that we have with the dealers 

table of contents consumer and debtor protection laws and regulations credit cards and other investments segment 
our us business is regulated directly and indirectly under various federal and state consumer protection  collection and other laws  rules and regulations  including the federal credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act  the federal wall street reform and consumer protection act  the federal truth in lending act tila  the federal equal credit opportunity act  the federal fair credit reporting act  the federal fair debt collection practices act  the federal gramm leach bliley act and the federal telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act

in addition  various statutes limit the liability of credit cardholders for unauthorized use  prohibit discriminatory practices in extending credit  impose limitations on the types of charges that may be assessed and restrict the use of consumer credit reports and other account related information 
many of our products are designed for customers at the lower end of the fico scoring range 
to offset the higher loss rates among these customers  these products generally are priced higher than our other products 
because of the greater credit risks inherent in these customers and the higher prices that we have had to charge for these products  they  and the banks that have issued them on our behalf  are subject to significant regulatory scrutiny 
if regulators  including the fdic which regulates the lenders that have issued these products on our behalf  the cfpb and the ftc  object to these products or how we have marketed them  then we could be required to modify or discontinue them 
over the past several years  we have modified both our products and how we have marketed them in response to comments from regulators 
also  in december  we settled litigation associated with allegations that the fdic and ftc had made about some of our credit card marketing practices 
in the uk  our credit card operations are subject to uk regulations that provide similar consumer protections to those provided under the us regulatory framework 
we are licensed and regulated by the office of fair trading oft  and we are governed by an extensive legislative and regulatory framework that includes the consumer credit act  the data protection act  privacy and electronic communications regulations  consumer protection and unfair trading regulations  financial services distance marketing regulations  the enterprise act  money laundering regulations  financial ombudsman service and advertising standards authority adjudications 
the aforementioned legislation and regulations impose strict rules on the look and content of consumer contracts  how aprs are calculated and stated  advertising in all forms  who we can contact and disclosures to consumers  among others 
the regulators such as the oft provide guidance on consumer credit practices including collections 
auto finance segment 
this segment is regulated directly and indirectly under various federal and state consumer protection and other laws  rules and regulations  including the federal tila  the federal equal credit opportunity act  the federal fair credit reporting act  the federal fair debt collection practices act  the federal gramm leach bliley act and the federal telemarketing and consumer fraud and abuse prevention act

many of the states in which this segment operates have various licensing requirements and impose certain financial or other conditions in connection with these licensing requirements 
privacy and data security laws and regulations 
we are required to manage  use  and store large amounts of personally identifiable information  principally customers confidential personal and financial data  in the course of our business 
we depend on our it networks and systems  and those of third parties  to process  store  and transmit that information 
in the past  consumer finance companies have been targeted for sophisticated cyber attacks 
a security breach involving our files and infrastructure could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
we take numerous measures to ensure the security of our hardware and software systems as well as customer information 
we are subject to various us federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect confidential personal and financial data 
for example  we must comply with guidelines under the gramm leach bliley act that require each financial institution to develop  implement and maintain a written  comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution s size and complexity  the nature and scope of the financial institution s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue 
additionally  various federal banking regulatory agencies  and as many as states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the virgin islands  have enacted data breach regulations and laws requiring customer notification in the event of a security breach 
competition credit cards and other investments segment 
we face substantial competition from other consumer lenders  the intensity of which varies depending upon economic and liquidity cycles 
our credit card and private label merchant credit businesses compete with national  regional and local bankcard and consumer credit issuers  other general purpose credit card issuers and retail credit card and merchant credit issuers 
many of these competitors are substantially larger than we are  have significantly greater financial resources than we do and have significantly lower costs of funds than we have 
auto finance segment 
competition within the auto finance sector is very widespread and fragmented 
our auto finance operations target automobile dealers that oftentimes are not capable of accessing indirect lending from major financial institutions or captive finance companies 
we compete mainly with a handful of national and regional companies focused on this credit segment eg  credit acceptance corporation  westlake financial  mid atlantic finance  general motors financial company  inc formerly americredit corp  drive financial  western funding inc  and america s car mart and a large number of smaller  regional private companies with a narrow geographic focus 
individual dealers with access to capital may also compete in this segment through the purchase of receivables from peer dealers in their markets

table of contents item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock or other securities involves a number of risks 
you should carefully consider each of the risks described below before deciding to invest in our common stock 
if any of the following risks develops into actual events  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected  the market price of our common stock or other securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
investors should be particularly cautious regarding investments in our common stock or other securities at the present time in light of the current net contraction of our receivables levels  uncertainties as to our business model going forward and our inability to achieve consistent earnings from our continuing operations in recent years 
our cash flows and net income are dependent upon payments from our loans and fees receivable and other credit products the collectability of our loans and fees receivable is a function of many factors including the criteria used to select who is issued credit  the pricing of the credit products  the lengths of the relationships  general economic conditions  the rate at which customers repay their accounts or become delinquent  and the rate at which customers borrow funds from us 
deterioration in these factors  which we have experienced over the past few years  adversely impacts our business 
in addition  to the extent we have over estimated collectability  in all likelihood we have over estimated our financial performance 
some of these concerns are discussed more fully below 
our portfolio of receivables is not diversified and originates from customers whose creditworthiness is considered sub prime 
historically  we have obtained receivables in one of two ways we have either solicited for the origination of the receivables or purchased pools of receivables from other issuers 
in either case  substantially all of our receivables are from financially underserved borrowers borrowers represented by credit risks that regulators classify as sub prime 
our reliance on sub prime receivables has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact  our performance 
our various past and current losses might have been mitigated had our portfolios consisted of higher grade receivables in addition to our sub prime receivables 
we have no immediate plans to issue or acquire significantly higher grade receivables 
we may not successfully evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and may not price our credit products so as to remain profitable 
the creditworthiness of our target market generally is considered sub prime based on guidance issued by the agencies that regulate the banking industry 
thus  our customers generally have a higher frequency of delinquencies  higher risks of nonpayment and  ultimately  higher credit losses than consumers who are served by more traditional providers of consumer credit 
some of the consumers included in our target market are consumers who are dependent upon finance companies  consumers with only retail store credit cards and or lacking general purpose credit cards  consumers who are establishing or expanding their credit  and consumers who may have had a delinquency  a default or  in some instances  a bankruptcy in their credit histories  but who  in our view  have demonstrated recovery 
we price our credit products taking into account the perceived risk level of our customers 
if our estimates are incorrect  customer default rates will be higher  we will receive less cash from the receivables and the value of our loans and fees receivable will decline  all of which will have a negative impact on performance 
while they have begun to rebound modestly  payment rates by our customers declined significantly in and and  correspondingly  default rates likewise increased throughout that time period 
it also is unclear whether our modestly improved payment rates can be sustained given weakness in the employment outlook and economic environment at large 
economic slowdowns increase our credit losses 
during periods of economic slowdown or recession  we experience an increase in rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses 
our actual rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses may be comparatively higher during periods of economic slowdown or recession than those experienced by more traditional providers of consumer credit because of our focus on the financially underserved consumer market  which may be disproportionately impacted 
we are subject to foreign economic and exchange risks 
because of our businesses in the uk  we have exposure to fluctuations in the uk economy  and such fluctuations recently have been significantly negative 
we also have exposure to fluctuations in the relative values of the us dollar and the british pound 
because the british pound has experienced a net decline in value relative to the us dollar since we commenced our most significant operations in the uk  we have experienced significant transaction and translation losses within our financial statements 
because a significant portion of our reported income is based on management s estimates of the future performance of our loans and fees receivable  differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables may cause fluctuations in net income 
significant portions of our reported income or losses are based on management s estimates of cash flows we expect to receive on our loans and fees receivable  particularly for such assets that we report based on fair value 
the expected cash flows are based on management s estimates of interest rates  default rates  payment rates  cardholder purchases  servicing costs  and discount rates 
these estimates are based on a variety of factors  many of which are not within our control 
substantial differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables will occur and cause fluctuations in our net income 
for instance  higher than expected rates of delinquencies and losses could cause our net income to be lower than expected 
similarly  as we have experienced for our credit card receivables portfolios with respect to financing agreements secured by our loans and fees receivable  levels of loss and delinquency can result in our being required to repay our lenders earlier than expected  thereby reducing funds available to us for future growth 
because all of our credit card receivables structured financing facilities are now in amortization status which for us generally means that the only meaningful cash flows that we are receiving with respect to the credit card receivables that are encumbered by such structured financing facilities are those associated with our contractually specified fee for servicing the receivables recent payment and default trends have substantially reduced the cash flows that we receive from these receivables 

table of contents due to our relative lack of historical experience with internet customers  we may not be able to target successfully these customers or evaluate their creditworthiness 
we have less historical experience with respect to the credit risk and performance of customers acquired over the internet 
as a result  we may not be able to target and evaluate successfully the creditworthiness of these potential customers should we engage in marketing efforts to acquire these customers 
therefore  we may encounter difficulties managing the expected delinquencies and losses and appropriately pricing our products 
we are substantially dependent upon borrowed funds to fund the receivables we originate or purchase we finance our receivables in large part through financing facilities 
all of our financing facilities are of finite duration and ultimately will need to be extended or replaced and contain financial covenants and other conditions that must be fulfilled in order for funding to be available 
moreover  most of these facilities currently are in amortization stages and are not allowing for the funding of any new loans  either based on their original terms or because we have not met financial or asset performance related covenants 
the cost and availability of equity and borrowed funds is dependent upon our financial performance  the performance of our industry generally and general economic and market conditions  and at times equity and borrowed funds have been both expensive and difficult to obtain 
beginning in  largely as a result of difficulties in the sub prime mortgage market  new financing generally has been sparse for sub prime lenders  and the financing that has been available has been on significantly less favorable terms than prior to as a result  beginning in the third quarter of  we significantly curtailed our marketing for new credit cards and currently are not issuing a significant number of new cards 
moreover  commencing in october we reduced credit lines and closed a significant number of accounts in response to the unavailability of financing and to reduce our risk exposure 
these activities continued into  and as a result  substantially all of our credit cards are now closed to cardholder purchases 
if additional financing facilities are not available in the future on terms we consider acceptable an issue that has been made even more acute in the us given recent regulatory changes that have reduced asset level returns on credit card lending we will not be able to grow our credit card business and it will continue to contract in size 
our financial performance is  in part  a function of the aggregate amount of receivables that are outstanding the aggregate amount of outstanding receivables is a function of many factors including purchase rates  payment rates  interest rates  seasonality  general economic conditions  competition from other credit card issuers and other sources of consumer financing  access to funding  and the timing  extent and success of our marketing efforts 
our credit card business currently is contracting 
growth is a product of a combination of factors  many of which are not in our control 
factors include the level and success of our marketing efforts  the degree to which we lose business to competitors  the level of usage of our credit products by our customers  the availability of portfolios for purchase on attractive terms  levels of delinquencies and charge offs  the availability of funding on favorable terms  the level of costs of soliciting new customers  our ability to employ and train new personnel  our ability to maintain adequate management systems  collection procedures  internal controls and automated systems  and general economic and other factors beyond our control 
we have substantially eliminated our us credit card marketing efforts and have aggressively reduced credit lines and closed credit card accounts 
in addition  the general economic downturn experienced in and significantly impacted not just the level of usage of our credit products by our customers but also levels of payments and delinquencies and other performance metrics 
as a result  our credit card business currently is contracting  and until market conditions more substantially reverse  we do not expect overall net growth in our credit card and other investments or our auto finance segments 

table of contents we operate in a heavily regulated industry changes in bankruptcy  privacy or other consumer protection laws  or to the prevailing interpretation thereof  may expose us to litigation  adversely affect our ability to collect our loans and fees receivable  or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
similarly  regulatory changes could adversely affect our ability or willingness to market credit cards and other products and services to our customers 
the accounting rules that govern our business are exceedingly complex  difficult to apply and in a state of flux 
as a result  how we value our receivables and otherwise account for our business is subject to change depending upon the changes in  and  interpretation of  those rules 
some of these issues are discussed more fully below 
reviews and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities under banking and consumer protection laws and regulations may result in changes to our business practices  may make collection of account balances more difficult or may expose us to the risk of fines  restitution and litigation 
our operations and the operations of the issuing banks through which we originate some of our credit products are subject to the jurisdiction of federal  state and local government authorities  including the cfpb  the sec  the fdic  the office of the comptroller of the currency  the ftc  uk banking authorities  state regulators having jurisdiction over financial institutions and debt origination and collection and state attorneys general 
our business practices  including the terms of our products and our marketing  servicing and collection practices  are subject to both periodic and special reviews by these regulatory and enforcement authorities 
these reviews can range from investigations of specific consumer complaints or concerns to broader inquiries into our practices generally 
if as part of these reviews the regulatory authorities conclude that we are not complying with applicable law  they could request or impose a wide range of remedies including requiring changes in advertising and collection practices  changes in the terms of our products such as decreases in interest rates or fees  the imposition of fines or penalties  or the paying of restitution or the taking of other remedial action with respect to affected customers 
they also could require us to stop offering some of our products  either nationally or in selected states 
to the extent that these remedies are imposed on the issuing banks through which we originate credit products  under certain circumstances we are responsible for the remedies as a result of our indemnification obligations with those banks 
we also may elect to change practices or products that we believe are compliant with law in order to respond to regulatory concerns 
furthermore  negative publicity relating to any specific inquiry or investigation could hurt our ability to conduct business with various industry participants or to attract new accounts and could negatively affect our stock price  which would adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and would raise our costs of doing business 
if any deficiencies or violations of law or regulations are identified by us or asserted by any regulator  or if the cfpb  the fdic  the ftc or any other regulator requires us to change any of our practices  the correction of such deficiencies or violations  or the making of such changes  could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or business 
in addition  whether or not we modify our practices when a regulatory or enforcement authority requests or requires that we do so  there is a risk that we or other industry participants may be named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations  including consumer protection laws 
any failure to comply with legal requirements by us or the issuing banks through which we originate credit products in connection with the issuance of those products  or by us or our agents as the servicer of our accounts  could significantly impair our ability to collect the full amount of the account balances 
the institution of any litigation of this nature  or any judgment against us or any other industry participant in any litigation of this nature  could adversely affect our business and financial condition in a variety of ways 
we are dependent upon banks to issue credit cards and certain other credit products 
our credit card and some of our other credit product programs are dependent on our issuing bank relationships  and their regulators could at any time limit their ability to issue some or all products on our behalf  or that we service on their behalf  or to modify those products significantly 
any significant interruption of those relationships would result in our being unable to originate new receivables and other credit products 
it is possible that a regulatory position or action taken with respect to any of the issuing banks through which we have originated credit products or for whom we service receivables might result in the bank s inability or unwillingness to originate future credit products on our behalf or in partnership with us 
in the current state  such a disruption of our issuing bank relationships principally would adversely affect our ability to conduct credit card issuances in the u 
k  and to grow our private label merchant credit product offerings and underlying receivables 

table of contents changes to consumer protection laws or changes in their interpretation may impede collection efforts or otherwise adversely impact our business practices 
federal and state consumer protection laws regulate the creation and enforcement of consumer credit card receivables and other loans 
many of these laws and the related regulations are focused on sub prime lenders and are intended to prohibit or curtail industry standard practices as well as non standard practices 
for instance  congress enacted legislation that regulates loans to military personnel through imposing interest rate and other limitations and requiring new disclosures  all as regulated by the department of defense 
similarly  in congress enacted legislation that required changes to a variety of marketing  billing and collection practices  and the federal reserve recently adopted significant changes to a number of practices through its issuance of regulations 
while our practices are in compliance with these changes  some of the changes eg  limitations on the ability to assess up front fees have significantly affected the viability of certain of our prior in particular our lower tier product offerings within the us changes in the consumer protection laws could result in the following receivables not originated in compliance with law or revised interpretations could become unenforceable and uncollectible under their terms against the obligors  we may be required to credit or refund previously collected amounts  certain fees and finance charges could be limited  prohibited or restricted  which would reduce the profitability of certain accounts  certain of our collection methods could be prohibited  forcing us to revise our practices or adopt more costly or less effective practices  limitations on the content of marketing materials could be imposed that would result in reduced success for our marketing efforts  federal and state laws may limit our ability to recover on charged off receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part  some of our products and services could be banned in certain states or at the federal level  federal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws could offer additional protections to customers seeking bankruptcy protection  providing a court greater leeway to reduce or discharge amounts owed to us  and a reduction in our ability or willingness to lend to certain individuals  such as military personnel 
material regulatory developments are likely to adversely impact our business and results from operations 
our automobile lending activities involve risks in addition to others described herein automobile lending exposes us not only to most of the risks described above but also to additional risks  including the regulatory scheme that governs installment loans and those attendant to relying upon automobiles and their repossession and liquidation value as collateral 
in addition  our most significant active auto finance segment business acquires loans on a wholesale basis from used car dealers  for which we rely upon the legal compliance and credit determinations by those dealers 
declines in automobile sales as we saw in recent years can cause declines in the overall demand for automobile loans 
while currently recovering fairly significantly  sales of both new and used cars declined precipitously in recent years 
while the unavailability of funding may have had a greater impact on our business  the decline in demand in recent years was consequential as well because it adversely affected the volume of our lending transactions and our recoveries of repossessed vehicles at auction 
any such future declines in demand will adversely impact our business 

table of contents funding for automobile lending is difficult to obtain and expensive 
in large part due to market concerns regarding sub prime lending  it is difficult to find lenders willing to fund our automobile lending activities 
our inability to obtain debt facilities with desirable terms eg  interest rates and advance rates and the other capital necessary to fund growth within our auto finance segment will cause periods like our current period of liquidations in our auto finance segment receivables and reductions in profitability and returns on equity 
although we did not experience any such adverse effects when our car facility began its required amortization period in june and was repaid in july and although any concerns of such adverse effects are now abated given the new lending facility car obtained in october  in the event we may not be able to renew or replace any future auto finance segment facilities that bear refunding or refinancing risks when they become due  our auto finance segment could experience significant liquidity constraints and diminution in reported asset values as lenders retain significant cash flows within underlying structured financings or otherwise under security arrangements for repayment of their loans 
if we cannot renew or replace future facilities or otherwise are unduly constrained from a liquidity perspective  we may choose to sell part or all of our auto loan portfolios  possibly at less than favorable prices 
our automobile lending business is dependent upon referrals from dealers 
currently we provide substantially all of our automobile loans only to or through used car dealers 
providers of automobile financing have traditionally competed based on the interest rate charged  the quality of credit accepted and the flexibility of loan terms offered 
in order to be successful  we not only will need to be competitive in these areas  but also will need to establish and maintain good relations with dealers and provide them with a level of service greater than what they can obtain from our competitors 
the financial performance of our automobile loan portfolio is in part dependent upon the liquidation of repossessed automobiles 
in the event of certain defaults  we may repossess automobiles and sell repossessed automobiles at wholesale auction markets located throughout the us auction proceeds from these types of sales and other recoveries rarely are sufficient to cover the outstanding balances of the contracts  where we experience these shortfalls  we will experience credit losses 
decreased auction proceeds resulting from depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold in periods of economic slowdown or recession have resulted in higher credit losses for us 
additionally  higher gasoline prices like those experienced during tend to decrease the auction value of certain types of vehicles  such as suvs 
repossession of automobiles entails the risk of litigation and other claims 
although we have contracted with reputable repossession firms to repossess automobiles on defaulted loans  it is not uncommon for consumers to assert that we were not entitled to repossess an automobile or that the repossession was not conducted in accordance with applicable law 
these claims increase the cost of our collection efforts and  if correct  can result in awards against us 
we routinely explore various opportunities to grow our business  to make investments and to purchase and sell assets we routinely consider acquisitions of  or investments in  portfolios and other assets as well as the sale of portfolios and portions of our business 
there are a number of risks attendant to any acquisition  including the possibility that we will overvalue the assets to be purchased and that we will not be able to produce the expected level of profitability from the acquired business or assets 
similarly  there are a number of risks attendant to sales  including the possibility that we will undervalue the assets to be sold 
as a result  the impact of any acquisition or sale on our future performance may not be as favorable as expected and actually may be adverse 
portfolio purchases may cause fluctuations in our reported credit card and other investments segment s managed receivables data  which may reduce the usefulness of this data in evaluating our business 
our reported credit card and other investments segment managed receivables data may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a result of recent and future credit card portfolio acquisitions 
as of december   credit card portfolio acquisitions accounted for of our total credit card and other investments segment managed receivables portfolio based on our ownership percentages 
receivables included in purchased portfolios are likely to have been originated using credit criteria different from the criteria of issuing bank partners that have originated accounts on our behalf 
receivables included in any particular purchased portfolio may have significantly different delinquency rates and charge off rates than the receivables previously originated and purchased by us 
these receivables also may earn different interest rates and fees as compared to other similar receivables in our receivables portfolio 
these variables could cause our reported managed receivables data to fluctuate substantially in future periods making the evaluation of our business more difficult 
any acquisition or investment that we make will involve risks different from and in addition to the risks to which our business is currently exposed 
these include the risks that we will not be able to integrate and operate successfully new businesses  that we will have to incur substantial indebtedness and increase our leverage in order to pay for the acquisitions  that we will be exposed to  and have to comply with  different regulatory regimes and that we will not be able to apply our traditional analytical framework which is what we expect to be able to do in a successful and value enhancing manner 

table of contents other risks of our business we are a holding company with no operations of our own 
as a result  our cash flow and ability to service our debt is dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries 
our ability to service our debt is dependent upon the cash flows and operating earnings of our subsidiaries 
the distribution of subsidiary earnings  or advances or other distributions of funds by subsidiaries to us  all of which are subject to statutory and could be subject to contractual restrictions  are contingent upon the subsidiaries cash flows and earnings and are subject to various business and debt covenant considerations 
unless we obtain a bank charter  we cannot issue credit cards other than through agreements with banks 
because we do not have a bank charter  we currently cannot issue credit cards other than through agreements with banks 
unless we obtain a bank or credit card bank charter  we will continue to rely upon banking relationships to provide for the issuance of credit cards to our customers 
even if we obtain a bank charter  there may be restrictions on the types of credit that the bank may extend 
our various issuing bank agreements have scheduled expirations dates 
if we are unable to extend or execute new agreements with our issuing banks at the expirations of our current agreements with them  or if our existing or new agreements with our issuing banks were terminated or otherwise disrupted  there is a risk that we would not be able to enter into agreements with an alternate provider on terms that we consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of our business 
we are party to litigation 
we are defendants in certain legal proceedings 
this includes litigation relating to our former retail micro loan operations and other litigation customary for a business of our nature 
in each case we believe that we have meritorious defenses or that the positions we are asserting otherwise are correct 
however  adverse outcomes are possible in these matters  and we could decide to settle one or more of our litigation matters in order to avoid the ongoing cost of litigation or to obtain certainty of outcome 
adverse outcomes or settlements of these matters could require us to pay damages  make restitution  change our business practices or take other actions at a level  or in a manner  that would adversely impact our business 
we face heightened levels of economic risk associated with new investment activities 
we recently have made a number of investments in businesses that are not directly allied to our traditional lending activities to  or associated with  the underserved consumer credit market 
in addition  some of these investments that we have made and may make in the future are or will be in debt or equity securities of businesses over which we exert little or no control  which likely exposes us to greater risks of loss than investments in activities and operations that we control 
while we make only those investments we believe have the potential to provide a favorable return  because some of the investments are outside of our core areas of expertise  they entail risks beyond those described elsewhere in this report 
as occurred with respect to certain such investments in and as noted above  these risks could result in the loss of part or all of our investments 
because we outsource account processing functions that are integral to our business  any disruption or termination of that outsourcing relationship could harm our business 
we generally outsource account and payment processing  and in  we paid total system services  inc million for these services 
if these agreements were not renewed or were terminated or the services provided to us were otherwise disrupted  we would have to obtain these services from an alternative provider 
there is a risk that we would not be able to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate provider on terms that we consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of our business 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation  and civil and criminal penalties 
to conduct our business  we are required to manage  use  and store large amounts of personally identifiable information  consisting primarily of confidential personal and financial data regarding our customers 
we also depend on our it networks and systems  and those of third parties  to process  store  and transmit this information 
as a result  we are subject to numerous us federal and state laws designed to protect this information 
security breaches involving our files and infrastructure could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
we take a number of measures to ensure the security of our hardware and software systems and customer information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect data being breached or compromised 
in the past  consumer finance companies have been the subject of sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their information technology 
an increasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security 

table of contents if any person  including our employees or those of third party vendors  negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data  we could be subject to costly litigation  monetary damages  fines  and or criminal prosecution 
any unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could subject us to liability under data privacy laws 
further  under credit card rules and our contracts with our card processors  if there is a breach of credit card information that we store  we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses 
in addition  if we fail to follow credit card industry security standards  even if there is no compromise of customer information  we could incur significant fines 
internet and data security breaches also could impede us from originating loans over the internet  cause us to lose customers or otherwise damage our reputation or business 
consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy  particularly on the internet 
as part of our growth strategy  we have originated loans over the internet 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential to maintaining customer confidence in our products and services offered online 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer application and transaction data transmitted over the internet 
in addition to the potential for litigation and civil penalties described above  security breaches could damage our reputation and cause customers to become unwilling to do business with us  particularly over the internet 
any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
our ability to solicit new loans over the internet would be severely impeded if consumers become unwilling to transmit confidential information online 
also  a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information  cause interruption in our operations  damage our computers or those of our users  or otherwise damage our reputation and business 
regulation in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our costs 
we are subject to various regulations related to privacy and data security breach  and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations 
for example  we are subject to the safeguards guidelines under the gramm leach bliley act 
the safeguards guidelines require that each financial institution develop  implement and maintain a written  comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution s size and complexity  the nature and scope of the financial institution s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue 
broad ranging data security laws that affect our business also have been adopted by various states 
compliance with these laws regarding the protection of customer and employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs for us  as well as potentially significant fines and penalties for non compliance 
in addition to the foregoing enhanced data security requirements  various federal banking regulatory agencies  and as many as states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the virgin islands  have enacted data breach regulations and laws requiring varying levels of customer notification in the event of a security breach 
also  federal legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidelines  laws and regulations that  if adopted  could further restrict how we collect  use  share and secure customer information  which could impact some of our current or planned business initiatives 
unplanned system interruptions or system failures could harm our business and reputation 
any interruption in the availability of our transactional processing services due to hardware and operating system failures will reduce our revenues and profits 
any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate  and possibly substantial  loss of revenues 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential members to believe that our systems are unreliable  leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our websites or services  and could permanently harm our reputation 
although our systems have been designed around industry standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks  and similar events or disruptions 
some of our systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
our systems also are subject to break ins  sabotage  and intentional acts of vandalism 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster  a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons  or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions  delays  and loss of critical data  and result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 

table of contents because of our loan to a small surface coal mining operation which  due to loan agreement modifications  we were required to consolidate into our financial statements in  but which has since ceased mining operations  we could be subject to i significant administrative  civil  and criminal financial and other penalties if this operation does not comply with environmental  health and safety regulations and ii liability to third parties for environmental contamination 
the coal mining industry is subject to strict regulation by federal  state and local authorities with respect to matters such as employee health and safety  permitting and licensing requirements  the protection of the environment  the protection of historic and natural resources  plants and wildlife  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed  and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability 
federal and state authorities inspect coal mines  and in the aftermath of the april  accident at an underground mine in central appalachia  mining operations have experienced  and may in the future continue to experience  a significant increase in the frequency and scope of these inspections 
numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations 
mining operations are required to prepare and present to federal  state and or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment 
the costs  liabilities and requirements associated with the laws and regulations related to these and other environmental matters may be costly and time consuming 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal financial and other penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and other enforcement measures 
we also could be subject to claims by third parties under federal and state statutes and or common law doctrines resulting from damage to the environment or historic or natural resources or exposure to hazardous substances on the mine property or elsewhere 
liability for environmental contamination may be without regard to fault and may be strict  joint and several  so that we may be held responsible for the entire amount of the contamination or related damages 
these and other similar unforeseen impacts that the former mining operation may have on the environment  as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with the former mining operation  could result in costs and liabilities that could adversely affect us 
even though this former coal mining operation ceased mining operations as of december  and has always been owned and primarily operated by third parties  our financial relationship with this former coal mining operation could subject us to these types of claims and penalties  particularly if these matters were not properly addressed by the owners and operators of the operation 
if we are held responsible for sanctions  costs and liabilities in respect of these matters  our profitability could be materially and adversely affected 
taxing authorities routinely review our tax returns and could challenge the positions that we have taken 
our businesses and the tax accounting for our businesses are very complex  thereby giving rise to a number of tax positions that are under consideration  and in some cases under dispute  in audits of our operations by various taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service at the federal level with respect to net operating losses that we incurred in and and that we carried back to obtain tentative refunds of federal taxes paid in earlier years dating back to it is possible that a court of ultimate jurisdiction may resolve tax positions in favor of the internal revenue service or that we may ultimately settle with the internal revenue service on one or more uncertain tax positions in a manner that differs from the liabilities that we have recorded associated with such positions under our recognition and measurement determinations 
the amounts involved in these audits  particularly the amounts of net operating losses that we carried back  are material 
to the extent that our ultimate resolution results in more liability than we have recorded  we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
climate change and related regulatory responses may impact our business 
climate change as a result of emissions of greenhouse gases is a significant topic of discussion and may generate federal and other regulatory responses in the near future  including the imposition of a so called cap and trade system 
it is impracticable to predict with any certainty the impact on our business of climate change or the regulatory responses to it  although we recognize that they could be significant 
the most direct impact is likely to be an increase in energy costs  which would adversely impact consumers and their ability to incur and repay indebtedness 
however  it is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact  either directionally or quantitatively  of climate change and related regulatory responses 
risks relating to an investment in our common stock the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive 
the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market constantly changes 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  the overall financing environment  which is critical to our value  the operating and stock performance of our competitors and other sub prime lenders  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in interest rates  the announcement of enforcement actions or investigations against us or our competitors or other negative publicity relating to us or our industry  changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  laws  regulations or the interpretations thereof that affect our various business activities and segments  general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  additions or departures of key personnel  and future sales of our common stock and the transfer or cancellation of shares of common stock pursuant to the share lending agreement 

table of contents in addition  the stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
future sales of our common stock or equity related securities in the public market  including sales of our common stock pursuant to share lending agreements or short sale transactions by purchasers of convertible notes  could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
sales of significant amounts of our common stock or equity related securities in the public market  including sales pursuant to share lending agreements  or the perception that such sales will occur  could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  including sales of our common stock in short sale transactions by purchasers of our convertible notes  may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our business is going through a substantial period of transition and we are exploring various options 
we are exploring various options designed to produce the greatest benefit possible for our shareholders 
currently these options include share repurchases  and we may consider additional options in the future 
on december   we paid a 
per share dividend to our shareholders  and a tender offer that we completed on may  resulted in our repurchase of  shares of our common stock for million  in addition to our repurchase of million in face amount of our convertible senior notes for million 
further  in a tender offer completed in april  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate cost of million 
finally  we completed a tender offer in september  whereby we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate cost of million 
we have the ability to issue preferred shares  warrants  convertible debt and other securities without shareholder approval 
our common shares may be subordinate to classes of preferred shares issued in the future in the payment of dividends and other distributions made with respect to common shares  including distributions upon liquidation or dissolution 
our articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to issue preferred shares without first obtaining shareholder approval 
if we issued preferred shares  these additional securities may have dividend or liquidation preferences senior to the common shares 
if we issue convertible preferred shares  a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common shareholders interest 
we have similar abilities to issue convertible debt  warrants and other equity securities 
our executive officers  directors and parties related to them  in the aggregate  control a majority of our voting stock and may have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval 
our executive officers  directors and parties related to them own a large enough stake in us to have an influence on  if not control of  the matters presented to shareholders 
as a result  these shareholders may have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election and removal of directors  the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as any reclassification  reorganization  merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and the control of our management and affairs 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of us  impede a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
note regarding risk factors the risk factors presented above are all of the ones that we currently consider material 
however  they are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not presently known to us  or which we currently consider immaterial  may also adversely affect us 
there may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us  and our analysis might be wrong 
if any of the risks that we face actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forward looking statements that we have made or might make 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment

certain of our subsidiaries are defendants in a purported class action lawsuit entitled knox  et al  vs 
first southern cash advance  et al  no 
cv  filed in the superior court of new hanover county  north carolina  on february  the plaintiffs allege that in conducting a so called payday lending business  certain subsidiaries within our retail micro loans segment the operations of which were sold in october  subject to our retention of liability for this litigation violated various laws governing consumer finance  lending  check cashing  trade practices and loan brokering 
the plaintiffs further allege that certain subsidiaries were the alter ego of our former retail micro loans segment subsidiaries and are liable for their actions

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therein where certain terms have been defined 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes forward looking statements 
we base these forward looking statements on our current plans  expectations and beliefs about future events 
there are risks that our actual experience will differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward looking statements in this section 
see cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements 
overview we are a provider of various credit and related financial services and products to or associated with the financially underserved consumer credit market a market represented by credit risks that regulators classify as sub prime 
currently  within our credit cards and other investments segment  we are collecting on portfolios of credit card receivables underlying now closed credit card accounts 
these receivables include both receivables we originated through third party financial institutions and portfolios of receivables we purchased from third party financial institutions 
the only open credit card accounts underlying our credit card receivables are those generated through our credit card products in the uk several of our portfolios of credit card receivables underlying now closed accounts are encumbered by non recourse structured financings  and for some of these portfolios  our only remaining economic interest is the servicing compensation we receive as an offset against our servicing costs given that the likely future collections on the portfolios are insufficient to allow for full repayment of the financings 
beyond these activities within our credit cards and other investments segment  we are applying the experiences and infrastructure associated with our historic credit card offerings to other credit product offerings  including private label merchant credit whereby we partner with retailers to provide credit at the point of sale to their customers who may have been declined under traditional financing options 
we specialize in providing this second look credit service in various industries across the us using our global infrastructure and technology platform  we also provide loan servicing activities  including underwriting  marketing  customer service and collections operations for third parties 
lastly  through our credit cards and other investments segment  we are engaged in limited investment activities in ancillary finance  technology and other businesses as we seek to build new products and relationships that could allow for greater utilization of our expertise and infrastructure 
in the current environment  the recurring cash flows we receive within our credit cards and other investments segment include those associated with servicing compensation  distributions from one of our equity method investees that in march purchased and now holds all of the outstanding notes issued out of our uk portfolio structured financing trust  unencumbered credit card receivables portfolios that have already generated enough cash to allow for the repayment of their underlying structured financing facilities  and our private label merchant credit receivables 
we are closely monitoring and managing our liquidity position  reducing our overhead infrastructure which was built to accommodate higher account originations and managed receivables levels and further leveraging our global infrastructure in order to maximize returns to shareholders on existing assets 
some of these actions  while prudent to maximize cash returns on existing assets  have had the effect of reducing our potential for profitability 
as is customary in our industry  we historically financed most of our credit card receivables through the asset backed securitization markets 
these markets worsened significantly in  and the level of advance rates or leverage we can achieve against credit card receivable assets in the current asset backed securitization markets is far below levels 
considering this reality  along with a us regulatory environment in which sub prime credit card lending returns on assets are significantly lower than they were before  we have concluded that we cannot achieve our desired returns on equity through us credit card lending 
we continue  however  to originate credit cards in the uk because we believe the uk environment to be more favorable than the us toward possible significant credit card origination growth in the future 
additionally  we believe that our growing portfolio of private label merchant credit receivables is generating and will continue to generate attractive returns on assets  thereby allowing us to secure debt financing under terms and conditions including advance rates and pricing that will allow us to achieve our desired returns on equity 
within our auto finance segment  our car subsidiary operations principally purchase and or service loans secured by automobiles from or for  and also provide floor plan financing for  a pre qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy here  pay here used car business 
we purchase the auto loans at a discount and with dealer retentions or holdbacks that provide risk protection 
also within our auto finance segment  we are collecting on portfolios of auto finance receivables that we previously originated through franchised and independent auto dealers in connection with prior business activities 

table of contents in august  we completed a transaction to sell to flexpoint fund ii  lp for million our investments in previously charged off receivables segment  including its balance transfer card operations  the credit card receivables and underlying activities of which were historically reflected within our credit cards and other investments segment 
the sales price included million cash of million and a note receivable of million  which was subsequently repaid at closing  of which million in cash will be held in escrow for months following the closing date of the transaction to satisfy certain indemnification provisions  and an additional million in cash that we received in the fourth quarter of upon the achievement of certain targets 
our basis in the net assets that were included in the sale was million resulting in a gain on sale after related expenses and recognition of the additional contingent consideration of million  which is reported within our income from discontinued operations category on our consolidated statements of operations 
we also completed transactions to dispose of our retail micro loans segment and our uk internet micro loan operations during as discussed further below 
in accordance with applicable accounting requirements  we have classified the results of all our sold operations as discontinued operations within our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
a summary of our most significant business changes or events during is as follows our receipt of million from a lender to compensate us for excess costs we incurred for the benefit of the lender in servicing a portfolio that collateralized the lender s loan to us  the september repurchase of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate cost of million  pursuant to a tender offer  the august sale of our investments in previously charged off receivables segment  including its balance transfer card operations as described above  and our may repayment to investors in our convertible senior notes of million in face amount of such then outstanding notes 
subject to the availability of growth capital at attractive terms and pricing  our shareholders should expect us to continue to evaluate and pursue a variety of activities  including the acquisition of additional credit card receivables portfolios  and potentially other financial assets that are complementary to our financially underserved credit card business  investments in other assets or businesses that are not necessarily financial services assets or businesses  additional opportunities to repurchase our convertible senior notes and other debt or our outstanding common stock  and servicing credit card receivables and other assets for third parties and in which we have limited or no equity interests to allow us to leverage our expertise and infrastructure 

table of contents consolidated results of operations income for the year months ended december  increases decreases in thousands from to total interest income interest expense fees and related income on earning assets fees on credit products changes in fair value of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value changes in fair value of notes payable associated with structured financings recorded at fair value losses on investments in securities loss on sale of jras assets other other operating income servicing income other income equity in income equity method investees total losses upon charge off of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value provision for losses on loans and fees receivable recorded at net realizable value other operating expenses salaries and benefits card and loan servicing marketing and solicitation depreciation other net income net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to controlling interests income from discontinued operations before income tax 
table of contents year ended december   compared to year ended december  total interest income 
total interest income consists primarily of finance charges and late fees earned on our credit card  private label merchant credit  and auto finance receivables 
the decline period over period is due to continued net liquidations of our credit card and auto finance receivables over the past year 
moreover  absent the effects of possible portfolio acquisitions  we expect our ongoing total interest income to decline for the next several quarters along with continuing expected net liquidations of our credit card and auto finance receivables 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense is due to our debt facilities being repaid commensurate with net liquidations of the underlying credit card receivables and auto finance receivables that serve as collateral for the facilities  and the effects of our repurchases of our convertible senior notes throughout and our may repayment of substantially all of our convertible senior notes as discussed in note  convertible senior notes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we also note that notwithstanding the effects of our convertible senior notes issuance discount accretion in increasing monthly interest expense amounts in the future  we expect lower interest expense for these notes in future periods attributable to our repurchases and our may repayment of substantially all of our convertible senior notes 
fees and related income on earning assets 
the significant factors affecting our differing levels of fees and related income on earning assets include increases in fees earned on our credit products  principally due to billings on credit card accounts in the uk  net of the effect of continued credit card receivables liquidations  other category losses arising in due to operating losses incurred by a former small coal mining operation we were required to consolidate in the fourth quarter of based on workout efforts we had undertaken related to a loan we made to the operation  and our recognition of a million loss in the three months ended march  corresponding to our sale of certain assets associated with our jras operations 
we do not expect significant ongoing losses with respect to the coal mining operation mentioned above 
by december   it had ceased mining operations  and we had written off substantially all of our investment  its only current activity is land reclamation 
although not materially different in amount between and  we note that with our million in and million in losses on investments in securities  we do not hold any material amounts of investments in securities as of december   as such  there is no potential for material future losses on such securities holdings in the future 
given expected net liquidations in our credit card receivables absent possible portfolio acquisitions in the future  we expect our change in fair value of credit card receivables recorded at fair value and our change in fair value of notes payable associated with structured financings recorded at fair value amounts to gradually diminish absent significant changes in the assumptions used to determine these fair values in the future 
these amounts  however  are subject to potentially high levels of volatility if we experience changes in the quality of our credit card receivables or if there are significant changes in market valuation factors eg  interest rates and spreads in the future 
such volatility will be muted somewhat  however  by the offsetting nature of the receivables and underlying debt being recorded at fair value and with the expected reductions in the face amounts of such outstanding receivables and debt as we experience further credit card receivables liquidations and associated debt amortizing repayments 
servicing income 
our reported servicing income is comprised of servicing compensation paid to us by third parties associated with our servicing of their loans and fees receivable 
positively impacting is income from transitional services we provided to the buyer of our retail micro loans segment  such services having substantially ended  and we currently are providing to the buyer of our investment in previously charged off receivables segment and balance transfer card operations since our disposition of these operations in august additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we received million from a lender to compensate us for excess costs we incurred for the benefit of the lender in servicing a credit card portfolio that collateralized the lender s loan to us 
absent these revenues none of which are expected to be material servicing income sources for us in  servicing income would have declined commensurate with liquidations in the portfolios of loans and fees receivables we service for third parties 

table of contents currently  servicing income is not a significant income source for us  and unless we grow the number of contractual servicing relationships we have with other third parties  we will not experience sustained levels of growth and income within this category 
we have started to receive servicing income associated with a new partner product rollout  however  revenues associated with this program are not yet sufficient to offset declines we are experiencing in this category 
other income 
other income principally is represented by our ancillary and interchange revenues 
the decline in our ancillary interchange revenues corresponds with our account closure actions and net liquidations we have experienced in all of our credit card receivables portfolios in recent years 
absent portfolio acquisitions  we do not expect significant ancillary and interchange revenues in the future 
equity in income of equity method investees 
the significant decrease in income associated with our equity method investees is principally related to our interest in the joint venture that purchased in march the outstanding notes issued out of our uk portfolio structured financing trust 
contemporaneous with our march acquisition of our interest in the joint venture  it elected to account for its investment in the uk portfolio structured financing notes at their fair value  and it recognized a million gain of which our share represented million equal to the excess of the fair value of the notes as of march  over the joint venture s discounted purchase price of the notes 
we expect to see continued liquidations in the credit card receivables portfolios and structured financing notes held by our equity method investees for the foreseeable future 
as such  absent possible additional investments in our existing or in new equity method investees in the future  we expect gradually declining effects from our equity method investments on our operating results 
losses upon charge off of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value 
this account reflects charge offs of the face amount credit card receivables we record at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have experienced a general trending decline in  and we expect future trending declines in  these charge offs as we continue to liquidate our credit card receivables 
the effects of this general trending decline were muted in  however  given our sale of a large volume of late stage delinquent accounts and related receivables which we treated as having been charged off contemporaneous with their sale out of our uk credit card receivables portfolio during the first quarter of provision for losses on loans and fees receivable recorded at net realizable value 
our provision for losses on loans and fees receivable recorded at net realizable value covers aggregate loss exposures on principal receivable balances  finance charges and late fees receivable underlying income amounts included within our total interest income category  and other fees receivable 
we experienced a year over year increase in this category between and due to the effects of disproportionately greater reductions in our allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivables recorded in the year ended december  associated with significant performance improvements experienced at that time  and elevated losses incurred on new credit product testing in the year ended december  for the foreseeable future  we expect growth in new product receivables recorded at net realizable value to exceed liquidations of our auto finance receivables recorded at net realizable value 
accordingly  we expect increases in our provisions for losses on loans and fees receivable recorded at net realizable value in future quarters such increases predominantly expected to reflect the effects of volume ie  growth of new product receivables  rather than credit quality changes or deterioration 
based on experience with some of our new products in particular our uk credit card product in  we expect net improvements in the credit quality of our new product receivables throughout see note  significant accounting policies and consolidated financial statement components  and our credit cards and other investments and auto finance segment discussions for further credit quality statistics and analysis 
total other operating expense 
total other operating expense decreased for the year ended december  relative to the year ended december   reflecting the following diminished salaries and benefits costs resulting from our ongoing cost cutting efforts as we continue to adjust our internal operations to reflect the declining size of our existing portfolios  lower card and loan servicing expenses reflecting the effects of continuing credit card and auto finance receivables portfolio liquidations  decreases in depreciation for the year ended december  reflecting a diminished level of capital investments by us  and decreases in marketing and solicitation and other expense levels consistent with the aforementioned receivables portfolio liquidations and our cost cutting efforts 

table of contents a large portion of our operating costs are variable based on the levels of accounts we market and receivables we service both for our own account and for others and the pace and breadth of our search for  acquisition of and introduction of new business lines  products and services 
however  a number of our operating costs are fixed and will over time comprise a larger percentage of our total costs given the ongoing contraction of our credit card and auto finance loans and fees receivable levels 
to this extent  our rate of cost reduction can be expected to slow relative to the rate of contraction in these loans and fees receivable 
we do  however  attempt to maximize the utility that we get from our incurrence of fixed costs by our testing and exploration of new products and services and areas of investment  and we continue to perform extensive reviews of all areas of our businesses for cost savings opportunities to better align our costs with our net liquidating portfolio of managed receivables 
notwithstanding our cost cutting efforts and focus  while it is relatively easy for us to scale back our variable expenses  it is much more difficult to which we alluded above for us to appreciably reduce our fixed and other costs associated with an infrastructure particularly within our credit cards and other investments segment that was built to support growing managed receivables and levels of managed receivables that are significantly higher than both our current levels and the levels that we expect to see in the near future 
at this point  our credit cards and other investments segment cash inflows are sufficient to cover its direct variable costs and a portion  but not all  of its share of overhead costs including  for example  corporate level executive and administrative costs and our convertible senior notes interest costs 
as such  if we are not successful in further reducing overhead costs or expanding revenue earning activities to levels commensurate with such costs  then  depending upon the sufficiency of excess cash flows and earnings generated from our auto finance subsidiary and those credit card portfolios that have repaid their underlying structured financing facilities  we may experience continuing pressure on our liquidity position and our ability to be profitable 
noncontrolling interests 
we reflect the ownership interests of noncontrolling holders of equity in our majority owned subsidiaries as noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of operations 
because of various transactions that took place in early  unless we enter into significant new majority owned subsidiary ventures with noncontrolling interest holders in the future  we expect to have negligible noncontrolling interests in our majority owned subsidiaries and negligible allocations of income or loss to noncontrolling interest holders in future quarters 
transactions contributing to this development and the decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in versus include our collective january and april purchases of most of the noncontrolling interest holders ownership interests in our credit cards and other investments segment majority owned subsidiaries  and our april sale of the majority owned subsidiaries through which we owned our former uk internet micro loan operations 
income taxes 
computed considering results for only our continuing operations before income taxes  our effective income tax benefit rate was for the year ended december   versus our effective income tax benefit rate of for the year ended december  we have experienced no material changes in effective tax rates associated with differences in filing jurisdictions  and the variations in our effective tax rates between the periods principally bear the effects of changes in valuation allowances against income statement oriented federal  foreign and state deferred tax assets  variations in the level of our pre tax income among the different reporting periods relative to the level of our permanent differences within such periods and the effects on financial reporting results of intra period tax allocations associated with our discontinued operations as required under gaap 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we recognized million and million in potential interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions during the years ended december  and  respectively 
to the extent such interest and penalties are not assessed as a result of a resolution of the underlying tax position  amounts accrued are reduced and reflected as a reduction of income tax expense 
we recognized million of such reductions in each of the years ended december  and credit cards and other investments segment included at the end of this credit cards and other investments segment section under the heading definitions of financial  operating and statistical measures are definitions for various terms we use throughout our discussion of the credit cards and other investments segment 
our credit cards and other investments segment includes our continuing activities relating to investments in and servicing of our various credit card receivables portfolios  as well as other investments and products that are not yet material to our overall financial position but which generally utilize much of the same infrastructure as our credit card operations 
the revenues we earn from credit card activities primarily include finance charges  late fees  over limit fees  annual fees  activation fees  monthly maintenance fees  returned check fees and cash advance fees 
also  while insignificant currently  revenues during previous periods of broad account origination and in which significant numbers of accounts were open to cardholder purchases also have included those associated with our sale of ancillary products such as memberships  subscription services and debt waiver  as well as interchange fees representing a portion of the merchant fee assessed by card associations based on cardholder purchase volumes underlying credit card receivables 

table of contents we record the finance charges and late fees assessed on our credit cards and other investments segment credit products in the interest income consumer loans  including past due fees category on our consolidated statements of operations  we include the over limit  annual  monthly maintenance  returned check  cash advance and other fees in the fees and other income on earning assets category on our consolidated statements of operations  and we reflect the charge offs within our provision for losses on loans and fees receivable on our consolidated statements of operations for all credit product receivables other than those credit card receivables underlying formerly off balance sheet securitization structures and within losses upon charge off of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value on our consolidated statements of operations for all of our other credit card receivables underlying formerly off balance sheet securitization structures for which we have elected the fair value option 
additionally  we show the effects of fair value changes for those credit card receivables for which we have elected the fair value option as a component of fees and related income on earning assets in our consolidated statements of operations 
we historically have originated and purchased credit card portfolios through subsidiary entities 
generally  if we control through direct ownership or exert a controlling interest in the entity  we consolidate it and reflect its operations as noted above 
if we exert significant influence but do not control the entity  we record our share of its net operating results in the equity in income of equity method investees category on our consolidated statements of operations 
background we make various references within our discussion of the credit cards and other investments segment to our managed receivables 
in calculating managed receivables data  we include within managed receivables those receivables we manage for our consolidated subsidiaries  but we exclude from managed receivables any noncontrolling interest holders shares of the receivables during applicable periods 
additionally  we include within managed receivables only our economic share of the receivables that we manage for our equity method investees 
financial  operating and statistical data based on aggregate managed receivables are important to any evaluation of our performance in managing our credit card portfolios  including our underwriting  servicing and collecting activities and our valuing of purchased receivables 
in allocating our resources and managing our business  management relies heavily upon financial data and results prepared on this managed basis 
analysts  investors and others also consider it important that we provide selected financial  operating and statistical data on a managed basis because this allows a comparison of us to others within the specialty finance industry 
moreover  our management  analysts  investors and others believe it is critical that they understand the credit performance of the entire portfolio of our managed receivables because it reveals information concerning the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent within the portfolios 
reconciliation of the managed receivables data to our gaap financial statements requires an understanding that our managed receivables data are based on billings and actual charge offs as they occur  without regard to any changes in our allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivable or any changes in the fair value of loans and fees receivable and their associated structured financing notes  inclusion of our economic share of or equity interest in the receivables we manage for our equity method investees  removal of our noncontrolling interest holders shares of the managed receivables underlying our gaap consolidated results  and treatment of the transaction in which our owned equity method investee acquired our uk portfolio structured financing trust notes a as a deemed sale of the uk portfolio trust receivables at their face amount  b followed by the owned equity method investee s deemed repurchase of such receivables for consideration equal to the discounted purchase price that it paid for the notes  and c as though the difference between the deemed face amount and the deemed discounted repurchase price of the receivables is to be treated as credit quality discount to be accreted into managed earnings as a reduction of net charge offs over the remaining life of the receivables 
we typically have purchased credit card receivables portfolios at substantial discounts 
in our managed basis statistical data  we apply a portion of these discounts against receivables acquired for which charge off is considered likely  including accounts in late stages of delinquency at the date of acquisition  this portion is measured based on our acquisition date estimate of the shortfall of cash flows expected to be collected on the acquired portfolios relative to the face amount of receivables represented within the acquired portfolios 
we refer to the balance of the discount for each purchase not needed for credit quality as accretable yield  which we accrete into net interest margin in our managed basis statistical data using the interest method over the estimated life of each acquired portfolio 
as of the close of each financial reporting period  we evaluate the appropriateness of the credit quality discount component and the accretable yield component of our acquisition discount based on actual and projected future results 
asset quality our delinquency and charge off data at any point in time reflect the credit performance of our managed receivables 
the average age of the accounts underlying our receivables  the timing of portfolio purchases  the success of our collection and recovery efforts and general economic conditions all affect our delinquency and charge off rates 
the average age of the accounts underlying our receivables portfolio also affects the stability of our delinquency and loss rates 
we consider this delinquency and charge off data in our determination of the fair value of our credit card receivables underlying formerly off balance sheet securitization structures  as well as our allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivable in the case of our other credit product receivables that we report at net realizable value 
our strategy for managing delinquency and receivables losses consists of account management throughout the customer relationship 
this strategy includes credit line management and pricing based on the risks 
see also our discussion of collection strategies under the heading how do we collect from our customers in item  business  of this report

the consistent quarterly declines in our period end and average managed receivables over the last eight quarters reflect the net liquidating state of our credit card receivables portfolios given the closure of substantially all credit card accounts underlying the portfolios 
moreover  with the exception of originations in the uk  we have curtailed our credit card marketing efforts in light of dislocation in the liquidity markets and uncertainty as to when and if these markets will rebound sufficiently to facilitate organic growth in our credit card receivables operations and an unfavorable credit card account origination regulatory climate in our primary us market 
despite fairly rapid receivables growth we are experiencing and expect over the coming quarters for our private label merchant credit offering  we do not anticipate receivables additions in the near term sufficient to offset the receivables balance contractions noted above 
delinquencies 
delinquencies have the potential to impact net income in the form of net credit losses 
delinquencies also are costly in terms of the personnel and resources dedicated to resolving them 
we intend for the account management strategies we use on our portfolio to manage and  to the extent possible  reduce the higher delinquency rates that can be expected in a more mature managed portfolio such as ours 
these account management strategies include conservative credit line management  purging of inactive accounts and collection strategies intended to optimize the effective account to collector ratio across delinquency categories 
we further describe these collection strategies under the heading how do we collect from our customers in item  business of this report 
we measure the success of these efforts by measuring delinquency rates 
these rates exclude accounts that have been charged off 
our lower tier credit card receivables typically experience substantially higher delinquency rates and charge off levels than those of our other originated and purchased portfolios 
our delinquency statistics recently have benefited from a mix change whereby disproportionately higher charge off levels for our lower tier credit card portfolios relative to those of our other credit card receivables have caused a decline in lower tier credit card receivables as a percentage of our aggregate managed credit card receivables 

table of contents given that our accounts primarily consist of closed credit card accounts with no significant account actions taken in the past several quarters  one would logically expect to see the relatively lower delinquency and charge off benefits of our more mature portfolios 
this trend is bearing out as noted in the trending year over year declines in our delinquency statistics relative to corresponding dates in prior years and is consistent with our expectations for the next few quarters 
we do note  however  that we participated in a unique transaction opportunity during the first quarter of  whereby we sold for a total of million  a price that we viewed as attractive  million in face value of our uk portfolio credit cards receivable associated with late stage delinquent accounts that had not yet reached the day charge off threshold 
these receivables had a gaap carrying value of million on the sale date  thereby rendering an insignificant gain upon their sale 
this transaction had two effects on our managed receivables data the future periods charge off of these receivables was accelerated into the first quarter of through our treatment of the accounts as having been charged off in all of our managed receivables charge off ratios contemporaneous with the sale of these receivables  and the removal of these late stage delinquent accounts from our march  managed receivables balances contributed to a better than typical improvement in our delinquency statistics as of march  and june  given this acceleration we experienced a slight increase in our delinquency rates as of september and december   in part due to the aforementioned transaction  but also in part to the effects of higher delinquency rates associated with credit card originations in the uk the effects of which are also evident in the table of current loans receivable  current fees receivable and delinquent loans and fees receivable as of december  and december  presented within note  significant accounting policies and consolidated financial statement components  to our consolidated financial statements 
nevertheless  we still expect to see continuing future trending declines in our delinquency rates when compared to similar prior year periods 
charge offs 
we generally charge off our credit card and other investments segment receivables when they become contractually days past due or within days of notification and confirmation of a customer s bankruptcy or death 
however  if a cardholder makes a payment greater than or equal to two minimum payments within a month of the charge off date  we may reconsider whether charge off status remains appropriate 
additionally  in some cases of death  receivables are not charged off if  with respect to the deceased customer s account  there is a surviving  contractually liable individual or an estate large enough to pay the debt in full 
our lower tier credit card offerings have higher charge offs relative to their average managed receivables balances  than do our other portfolios 
due to the recent higher rate of decline in these receivables relative to all of our other outstanding credit card receivables  all things being equal  one would expect reduced charge off ratios 
this is supported by the above overall trend of declining year over year quarterly charge off rates in all quarters but the first quarter of this trend is muted to some degree  however  for our net charge off ratio and our adjusted charge off ratio as discussed in more detail below simply due to a change in the mix of our charge offs toward a higher relative level of principal charge offs versus finance and fee charge offs 
all of our charge off ratios were skewed higher during the first quarter of by reason of the unique transaction opportunity mentioned in our delinquencies discussion above 
in future quarters and absent any unique transaction opportunities like that experienced in the first quarter of  we expect the general rate of decline in our charge off ratios to moderate and our charge off ratios to generally stabilize subject to normal seasonal variations 
our expectation of a reduced rate of decline in our charge off ratios is based on the age  maturity and stability of our portfolio of generally liquidating receivables associated with closed credit card accounts  coupled with an expectation of higher charge off rates on credit card receivables associated with credit card originations in the uk combined gross charge off ratio 
see the above general charge offs discussion 
net charge off ratio 
see the above general charge offs discussion 
adjusted charge off ratio 
this ratio reflects our net charge offs  less credit quality discount accretion with respect to our acquired portfolios 
therefore  its trend line should follow that of our net charge off ratio  adjusted for the diminishing impact of past portfolio acquisitions and for the additional impact of new portfolio acquisitions 
in the first and second quarters of  the gap between the net charge off ratio and the adjusted charge off ratio widened as it typically does following each portfolio acquisition at a discounted purchase price because we determine our managed receivables statistics by treating the transaction in which our owned equity method investee acquired our uk portfolio structured financing trust notes as a deemed sale of the uk portfolio trust receivables at their face amount  followed by the owned equity method investee s repurchase of such receivables for consideration equal to the discounted purchase price that it paid for the notes 
although one would expect the gap between the net charge off ratio and the adjusted charge off ratio to gradually narrow as we saw in the last two quarters of absent another portfolio acquisition  the unique transaction opportunity mentioned in our delinquencies discussion above caused a significant widening of the gap between the net charge off ratio and the adjusted charge off ratio in the first quarter of that transaction opportunity caused our first quarter charge offs to be comprised of a disproportionally higher level of uk portfolio charge offs than normal for which significant levels of credit quality discount were accreted in the adjusted charge off ratio computation in the first quarter of 

table of contents we also note that our uk credit card receivables originations  which have produced high levels of delinquencies and charge offs for early vintages  caused a mix change whereby a greater proportion than typical of our net charge offs in the fourth quarter of were comprised of receivables ie  early vintage ie receivables originations not represented by those in portfolios purchased at discounted purchase prices 
accordingly  notwithstanding year over year declines in our fourth quarter combined gross charge off and net charge off ratios  we experienced a slight increase in our fourth quarter adjusted charge off ratio relative to that in the fourth quarter of total yield ratio and gross yield ratio 
as noted previously  the mix of our managed receivables generally has shifted away from those receivables of our lower tier credit card offerings 
those receivables have higher delinquency rates and late and over limit fee assessments than do our other portfolios  and thus have higher total yield and gross yield ratios as well 
accordingly  we would expect to see a slight generally trending decline in our total yield and gross yield ratios consistent with disproportionate reductions in our lower tier credit card receivables due to their higher charge off levels over the past several quarters 
our total and gross yield ratios also have been adversely affected over the past several quarters by our uk portfolio acquisition 
its total and gross yields are below average as compared to our other portfolios  and the rate of decline in receivables in this portfolio has lagged behind the rate of decline in receivables in our other portfolios  thus continuing to suppress our yield ratios 
notwithstanding the above  our addition of lower tier credit card accounts in the uk in has temporarily reversed and delayed our generally declining total and gross yield ratio trends 
while the addition of these accounts has resulted in temporary increases in our total and gross yield ratios  we expect these accounts to also reduce the rate of decline in our charge off rates as the accounts season  mature  and charge off at higher rates than we experience on our liquidating pool of credit card receivables associated with closed credit card accounts 
we also note exceptions to the trendlines discussed above with respect to our total yield ratio wherein our fourth quarter and third quarter total yield ratios were depressed by respective million and million write downs of our investments in non marketable debt and equity securities 
absent these write downs  our total yield ratios would have been in both the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of these write downs also adversely impacted our other income ratio as discussed below 
net interest margin 
because of the significance of the late fees charged on our lower tier credit card receivables as a percentage of outstanding receivables balances  we generally would expect our net interest margin to increase as our lower tier credit card receivables become a larger percentage and to decrease as they become a smaller percentage of our overall managed receivables 
accordingly  the disproportionate reductions we have experienced in our lower tier credit card receivables levels is the principal factor that has contributed to the continued general declining trend in our net interest margins relative to those experienced in prior years 
our net interest margin also is affected by the effects of our uk portfolio acquisition 
the net interest margin for this portfolio is below the weighted average rate of our other portfolios  and the impact of this portfolio continues to be felt as our originated portfolios continue to decline in size at a faster pace than our acquired uk portfolio  thus increasing the impact of this portfolio s lower net interest margin on the overall results 
consistent with our experiences in the past few quarters  we expect a relatively stable low double digit net interest margin for the foreseeable future 
other income ratio 
we generally expect our other income ratio to increase as our lower tier receivables become a larger percentage  and to decrease as our lower tier receivables become a smaller percentage  of our overall managed receivables 
when underlying open accounts  these receivables generate significantly higher annual membership  over limit  monthly maintenance and other fees than do our other portfolios 
consequently  the closure of credit card accounts and the mix change discussed above under which our lower tier receivables comprise a much smaller percentage of our total receivables accounts in significant part for our low other income ratios 
as generally experienced in and  we expect a positive generally low single digit other income ratio for the foreseeable future unless we experience material gains or losses associated with future debt repurchases  investment write downs or other unique transactions  which could cause an increase or decrease in the ratio 
negatively affecting our other income ratio for the third quarter of were million of losses that we recognized due to other than temporary declines in the values of non marketable debt securities in which we had previously invested  excluding the impact of these write downs  our other income ratio would have been 
similarly in the fourth quarter of  we experienced other than temporary declines in the values of non marketable debt and equity securities in the amount of million  excluding the impact of these write downs  our other income ratio would have been 
operating ratio 
although we have been highly focused on expense reduction and cost control efforts  our managed receivables levels are generally falling at faster rates than the rates at which we have been able thus far to reduce our costs particularly when considering our fixed infrastructure costs and costs of other non receivables based business initiatives and investments 
this accounts for the trendline of generally increasing operating ratios over the past several quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  this trend was significantly offset due to the receipt of million from a lender to compensate us for excess costs we incurred for the benefit of the lender in servicing a credit card portfolio that collateralized the lender s loan to us  excluding the impact of this payment  our operating ratio would have been 
future expectations because the accounts underlying substantially all of our credit card receivables are closed and because of expected liquidations within each of our credit card receivables portfolios  we generally do not expect our yield oriented managed receivables statistics to improve significantly from their current levels for the foreseeable future 

table of contents our credit card operations within our credit cards and other investments segment are separate and distinct from our other operations 
as such  if we were ever to conclude that the ongoing costs of these operations exceeded their benefits ie  cash flows to us and residual asset values  we could liquidate our credit card operations either by continuing to allow them to decline in size or through more aggressive action with minimal impact on future financial performance of our other operations 
we reference the table included in note  convertible senior notes  to our consolidated financial statements  which quantifies the risk to our consolidated total equity position associated with a complete liquidation of our credit cards receivables portfolios 
definitions of financial  operating and statistical measures combined gross charge off ratio 
represents an annualized fraction the numerator of which is the aggregate amounts of finance charge  fee and principal losses from customers unwilling or unable to pay their receivables balances  as well as from bankrupt and deceased customers  less current period recoveries  and the denominator of which is average managed receivables 
recoveries on managed receivables represent all amounts received related to managed receivables that previously have been charged off  including payments received directly from customers and proceeds received from the sale of those charged off receivables 
recoveries typically have represented less than of average managed receivables 
net charge off ratio 
represents an annualized fraction the numerator of which is the principal amount of losses  net of recoveries  and the denominator of which is average managed receivables 
the numerator excludes finance charge and fee charge offs  which are charged against the related income item at the time of charge off  as well as losses from fraudulent activity in accounts  which are included separately in other operating expenses 
adjusted charge off ratio 
represents an annualized fraction the numerator of which is principal net charge offs as adjusted to apply discount accretion related to the credit quality of acquired portfolios to offset a portion of the actual face amount of net charge offs  and the denominator of which is average managed receivables 
historically  upon our acquisitions of credit card receivables  a portion of the discount reflected within our acquisition prices has related to the credit quality of the acquired receivables that portion representing the excess of the face amount of the receivables acquired over the future cash flows expected to be collected from the receivables 
because we treat the credit quality discount component of our acquisition discount as related exclusively to acquired principal balances  the difference between our net charge offs and our adjusted charge offs for each respective reporting period represents the total dollar amount of our charge offs that were charged against our credit quality discount during each respective reporting period 
total yield ratio 
represents an annualized fraction  the numerator of which includes all finance charge and late fee income billed on all outstanding receivables  plus credit card fees including over limit fees  cash advance fees  returned check fees and interchange income  plus earned  amortized amounts of annual membership fees and activation fees with respect to certain of our credit card products  plus ancillary product income  plus amortization of the accretable yield component of our acquisition discounts for portfolio purchases  plus gains or less losses on debt repurchases and other activities within our credit cards and other investments segment  and the denominator of which is average managed receivables 
gross yield ratio 
represents an annualized fraction  the numerator of which is finance charges and late fees  and the denominator of which is average managed receivables 
net interest margin 
represents an annualized fraction  the numerator of which includes finance charge and late fee income billed on all outstanding receivables  plus amortization of the accretable yield component of our acquisition discounts for portfolio purchases  less interest expense associated with portfolio specific structured financing debt facilities and finance charge and late fee charge offs  and the denominator of which is average managed receivables 
net interest margins are influenced by a number of factors  including the level of finance charges and late fees  the weighted average cost of funds underlying portfolio specific debt or within our securitization structures  amortization of the accretable yield component of our acquisition discounts for portfolio purchases and the level of our finance charge and late fee charge offs 
other income ratio 
represents an annualized fraction  the numerator of which includes credit card fees including over limit fees  cash advance fees  returned check fees and interchange income  plus earned  amortized amounts of annual membership fees and activation fees with respect to certain of our credit card products  plus ancillary product income  less all fee charge offs with the exception of late fee charge offs  which are netted against the net interest margin  plus realized and unrealized gains or less losses on debt repurchases  investments in debt and equity securities  and other activities within our credit cards and other investments segment  and the denominator of which is average managed receivables 
operating ratio 
represents an annualized fraction  the numerator of which includes all expenses other than marketing and solicitation expenses associated with our credit cards and other investments segment  net of any servicing income we receive from third parties  and the denominator of which is average managed receivables 

table of contents auto finance segment our auto finance segment historically included a variety of auto sales and lending activities 
our original platform  car  acquired in april  principally purchases and or services loans secured by automobiles from or for and also provides floor plan financing for a pre qualified network of independent automotive dealers and automotive finance companies in the buy here  pay here used car business 
we also historically owned substantially all of jras  a buy here  pay here dealer we acquired in and operated from that time until our disposition of certain jras operating assets in the first quarter of lastly  our acc platform acquired during historically purchased retail installment contracts from franchised car dealers 
we ceased origination efforts within the acc platform during and outsourced the collection of its portfolio of auto finance receivables 
collectively  we currently serve more than dealers through our auto finance segment in states 
managed receivables background for reasons set forth previously within our credit cards and other investments segment discussion  we also provide managed receivables based financial  operating and statistical data for our auto finance segment 
reconciliation of the auto finance managed receivables data to our gaap financial statements requires an understanding that our managed receivables data are based on billings and actual charge offs as they occur  without regard to any changes in our allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivable

period end managed receivables period end managed accounts percent or more days past due percent or more days past due percent or more days past due average managed receivables gross yield ratio adjusted charge off ratio recovery ratio net interest margin other income ratio operating ratio managed receivables 
period end managed receivables have gradually declined because we curtailed purchasing and origination activities within our acc and jras operations prior to and sold our jras operations  but not its underlying receivables  in february 
for all of the periods set forth above  only car continues to purchase originate loans  but not at growth levels significant enough to offset the gradual liquidations of our acc and jras portfolios managed receivables 
acc and jras managed receivables are substantially liquidated at this point  and we expect the pace of decline in our managed receivables levels to abate significantly over the next few quarters 
we also expect to begin seeing net growth in our managed receivables within the next year 

table of contents delinquencies 
our acc and jras receivables are substantially liquiditated and are at largely insignificant levels relative to our better performing car receivables  which have significantly lower late stage or more days past due delinquency and charge off rates  this fact and a recovering economy accounted for the modest year over year general improvement in delinquency statistics through the end of the second quarter of because the jras and acc receivables are largely insignificant  we do not expect any material further improvements in our delinquency statistics associated with further liquidations of these receivables 
delinquencies rose somewhat within our car receivables portfolio in the third and fourth quarters of  primarily due to seasonal patterns and a slightly weakened market 
delinquencies experienced in and early reflected historically low delinquency rates  and the current levels we are experiencing more closely represent what we would expect going forward 
even at the slightly elevated rates when compared to last year  because we earn significant yields on car s receivables and have significant dealer reserves ie  retainages or holdbacks on the amount of funding car provides to its dealer customers to protect against credit losses  we are not currently concerned that the rise in delinquencies will have a significantly adverse impact on our adjusted charge off ratio 
gross yield ratio  net interest margin and other income ratio 
with the exception of the first and third quarters of  a general trend line of improving net interest margins is evident relative to comparable prior year periods due in part to liquidation of the jras and acc receivables  thereby causing the better performing car receivables to comprise a greater percentage of our average managed auto finance receivables 
the terms of our acc debt facility provide that of any cash flows net of contractual servicing compensation generated on the acc auto finance receivables portfolio after repayment of the notes will be allocated to the note holders as additional compensation for the use of their capital 
significant recent improvements in performance of the acc receivables caused us to resume significant accruals of contingent interest expense under the debt facility  and our accruals of such additional interest during the first and third quarters of caused the decline in our net interest margin relative to our improving net interest margin trend line 
because all principal under the acc debt facility has now been repaid and the only remaining obligation under the facility is for contingent interest that we have fully accrued at this point  we do not expect any significant future effects on our net interest margin associated with contingent interest under the acc debt facility 
consistent with our recent experiences  because our liquidating acc and jras receivables are now largely insignificant relative to our total portfolio of auto finance receivables  the higher gross yields we achieve within our car operations generally are expected to continue to result in slightly higher trending gross yield ratios and net interest margins in future quarters relative to comparable prior year quarterly levels 
the principal component of our other income ratio was the gross profit that our former jras buy here  pay here operations generated from their auto sales prior to our sale of these operations in february as such  the other income ratio historically moved in relative tandem with the volume of jras s auto sales 
our other income ratio in the first quarter of reflects the million loss recognized on the sale of our jras operating assets in february because of the sale of these operations and the commensurate elimination of the principal source of other income  we expect an insignificant other income ratio for the foreseeable future in line with what we have experienced in quarters 
adjusted charge off ratio and recovery ratio 
we generally charge off auto finance receivables when they are between and days past due  unless the collateral is repossessed and sold before that point  in which case we will record a charge off when the proceeds are received 
the adjusted charge off ratio reflects our net charge offs  less credit quality discount accretion with respect to our acquired portfolios 
our adjusted charge off ratio was significantly elevated in the first quarter of  principally reflecting the adverse effects of five jras lot closures and the corresponding negative impact this had on jras collections 
because our acc receivables and the receivables of our jras operations that we retained in connection with our sale of our jras operations in february have declined and are now largely insignificant relative to our total portfolio of auto finance receivables and because of significantly improved performance of the acc and jras receivables due both to the aging of the portfolios and some economic recovery and better than expected tax refund seasonal effects  our adjusted charge off ratio has declined significantly subsequent to the first quarter of our car receivables  which experience significantly lower charge offs  now comprise a more significant proportion of our average managed auto finance receivables a factor that not only contributed to the decline in our adjusted charge off ratio  but is also expected to result in lower adjusted charge off ratios in future quarters 
also serving to reduce our second quarter adjusted charge off ratio as well as increase our second quarter recovery ratio was a large sale of repossessed autos at auction related to the receivables of our former jras operations  which had accumulated a growing inventory of such vehicles leading into the second quarter of as well as increased recoveries experienced in our acc portfolio 
a similar increase in recoveries was seen during the fourth quarter of in our acc portfolio 
we expect our recovery rate to fluctuate modestly from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the sale of repossessed autos  but more importantly  we expect our recovery rate to fall gradually with the declining effects of acc and jras on our operations  car experiences significantly lower charge offs and recoveries than experienced in acc s and jras s operations 
operating ratio 
we have experienced a modest general trend line of increasing year over year operating ratios  which largely reflects the higher costs of our car operations as a percentage of receivables than such operating costs of our acc and jras operations as a percentage of their receivables in prior periods 
such higher costs correspond with the significantly higher gross yield ratios and net interest margins within our car operations 
as noted above  our car receivables and operating costs now comprise a greater percentage of respective total auto finance segment receivables and operating costs given the gradual liquidation of acc and jras receivables 
notwithstanding this general trend line  we do not expect a significantly higher operating ratio for the foreseeable future 
the spike in the first quarter of operating ratio arose due to an impairment charge of million recognized during that quarter associated with unfavorable terms on the sublease of our former acc offices and certain non recurring costs we incurred in the collection of our jras receivables 

table of contents future expectations our car operations are performing well in the current environment achieving consistent profitability and are expected to continue at current levels for the foreseeable future 
generally offsetting these positive results are acc and jras operations  which are expected to modestly depress overall auto finance segment results relative to car s stand alone results for however  because acc s and jras s receivables are now substantially liquidated  they should have a small and further diminishing adverse future effect on the positive results we are experiencing within our car operations 
additionally  planned modest expansions in will have an initial negative impact on our operating ratio as we incur start up costs associated with the new locations 
liquidity  funding and capital resources we continue to see some dislocation in the availability of attractively priced and termed liquidity as a result of the market disruptions that began in this ongoing disruption has resulted in a decline in liquidity available to fund sub prime credit card receivables  wider spreads above the underlying interest indices typically libor for our borrowings for the loans that lenders are willing to make against credit card receivables  and a decrease in advance rates for those loans 
moreover  the most recent global financial crisis differs in key respects from our experiences during other down economic and financing cycles 
first  while we had difficulty obtaining asset backed financing for our originated credit card portfolio activities at attractive advance rates in the last down cycle through  the credit spreads above base pricing indices like libor at that time were not as wide expensive as those seen during the recent crisis 
additionally  while we were successful during that down cycle in obtaining asset backed financing for credit card portfolio acquisitions at attractive advance rates  pricing and other terms  that financing has not been available from traditional market participants since the advent of the most recent crisis 
although we are hopeful that subprime credit card liquidity markets ultimately will return to more traditional levels  we are not able to predict when or if that will occur  and we are managing our business with the assumption that such liquidity markets will not return to more traditional levels in the near term 
we have closed substantially all of our credit card accounts other than those associated with our uk accounts 
to the extent possible given constraints thus far on our ability to reduce expenses at the same rate as our managed receivables are liquidating  we are managing our receivables portfolios with a goal of generating the necessary cash flows over the coming quarters for us to use in de leveraging our business  while continuing to enhance shareholder value to the greatest extent possible 
all of our credit cards and other investments segment s structured financing facilities are expected to amortize down with collections on the receivables within their underlying trusts with no bullet repayment requirements or refinancing balance sheet risks to us 
accordingly  we now have only one structured financing facility that presents repayment requirements or refinancing balance sheet risks to us that being our car structured finance facility into which we entered in october of and which does not mature until october our focus on liquidity has resulted in and will continue to result in growth and profitability trade offs 
for example  as noted throughout this report  we have closed substantially all of our credit card accounts other than those underlying our accounts in the uk  consequently  our portfolio of our managed credit card receivables is expected to show net liquidations for the foreseeable future 
at december   we had million in unrestricted cash 
because the characteristics of our assets and liabilities change  liquidity management has been a dynamic process for us affected by the pricing and maturity of our assets and liabilities 
we historically have financed our business through cash flows from operations  asset backed structured financings and the issuance of debt and equity 
details concerning our cash flows for the year ended december  are as follow during the year ended december   we generated million in cash flows from operations compared to million of cash flows from operations generated during the year ended december  the decrease was principally related to lower collections of credit card finance charge receivables in the year ended december  relative to the same period in  given diminished receivables levels  the lack of any finance and fee collections associated with our uk internet micro loan operations in the year ended december   given our sale of these operations in april  and reduced net liquidations of receivables associated with our jras operations in versus during the year ended december   we generated million of cash through our investing activities  compared to generating million of cash in investing activities during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the reduced levels of our outstanding investments and the cash returns thereof in based on the shrinking size of our liquidating credit card and auto finance receivable portfolios  as well as the net proceeds we received from the sale of our mem and jras operations during the year ended december  offsetting this decline are net proceeds received during the year ended december  from the sale of our investments in previously charged off receivables segment  including its balance transfer card operations 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash in financing activities  compared to our use of million of cash in financing activities during the year ended december  in both periods  the data reflect net repayments of debt facilities corresponding with net declines in our loans and fees receivable that serve as the underlying collateral for the facilities principally credit card and auto loans and fees receivable 
beyond the effects of higher than repayment levels based on receivables liquidations under our structured financing facilities  we used more cash to fund stock repurchases in than in we used million in proceeds to repurchase stock in a april tender offer  versus our use of million to repurchase stock in a september tender offer 
these effects were partially offset  however  by the fact that we used only million of cash for convertible senior notes repurchases in the year ended december   versus the million we used to repay our convertible senior notes upon the exercise by note holders of a put right in may 
table of contents we note that the million in aggregate december  unrestricted cash referenced above represents the aggregate of all unrestricted cash held by our various business subsidiaries 
beyond our immediate financing efforts discussed throughout this report  shareholders should expect us to evaluate debt and equity issuances as a means to fund our investment opportunities 
we expect to take advantage of any opportunities to raise additional capital if terms and pricing are attractive to us 
any proceeds raised under these efforts or additional liquidity available to us could be used to fund potential receivables portfolio acquisitions  which may represent attractive opportunities for us in the current liquidity environment  further repurchases of our convertible senior notes and common stock  and investments in certain financial and non financial assets or businesses 
pursuant to a share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors on may   we are authorized to repurchase  shares of our common stock through june  lastly  we note that as of this report date the only remaining material refunding or refinancing risks to us are those of the car financing facility into which we entered in october and which does not mature until october and our convertible senior notes which are due in november contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements commitments and contingencies we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements  however  we do have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur contingent commitments 
we do not currently expect that these contingent commitments will result in any material amounts being paid by us 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of these matters 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  significant accounting policies and consolidated financial statement components  to our consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting estimates we have prepared our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
these principles are numerous and complex 
we have summarized our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in many instances  the application of gaap requires management to make estimates or to apply subjective principles to particular facts and circumstances 
a variance in the estimates used or a variance in the application or interpretation of gaap could yield a materially different accounting result 
it is impracticable for us to summarize every accounting principle that requires us to use judgment or estimates in our application 
nevertheless  we describe below the areas for which we believe that the estimations  judgments or interpretations that we have made  if different  would have yielded the most significant differences in our consolidated financial statements 
on a quarterly basis  we review our significant accounting policies and the related assumptions  in particular  those mentioned below  with the audit committee of the board of directors 
measurements for loans and fees receivable at fair value and notes payable associated with structured financings at fair value our valuation of loans and fees receivable  at fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows using a valuation model of expected cash flows and the estimated cost to service and collect those cash flows 
we estimate the present value of these future cash flows using a valuation model consisting of internally developed estimates of assumptions third party market participants would use in determining fair value  including estimates of net collected yield  principal payment rates  expected principal credit loss rates  costs of funds  discount rates and servicing costs 
similarly  our valuation of notes payable associated with structured financings  at fair value is based on the present value of future cash flows utilized in repayment of the outstanding principal and interest under the facilities using a valuation model of expected cash flows net of the contractual service expenses within the facilities 
we estimate the present value of these future cash flows using a valuation model consisting of internally developed estimates of assumptions third party market participants would use in determining fair value  including estimates of net collected yield  principal payment rates and expected principal credit loss rates on the credit card receivables that secure the non recourse notes payable  costs of funds  discount rates  and contractual servicing fees 

table of contents the aforementioned credit losses  payment rates  servicing costs  contractual servicing fees  costs of funds  discount rates and yields earned on credit card receivables estimates significantly affect the reported amount of our loans and fees receivable  at fair value and our notes payable associated with structured financings  at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet  and they likewise affect our changes in fair value of loans and fees receivable recorded at fair value and changes in fair value of notes payable associated with structured financings recorded at fair value categories within our fees and related income on earning assets line item on our consolidated statement of operations 
allowance for uncollectible loans and fees through our analysis of loan performance  delinquency data  charge off data  economic trends and the potential effects of those economic trends on our customers  we establish an allowance for uncollectible loans and fees receivable as an estimate of the probable losses inherent within those loans and fees receivable that we do not report at fair value 
to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates of uncollectible loans and fees receivable  our results of operations and liquidity could be materially affected 
recognition and measurements with respect to uncertain tax positions our businesses and the tax accounting for our businesses are very complex  thereby giving rise to a number of uncertain tax positions  several of which are matters that are under consideration  and in some cases under dispute  in audits of our operations by various taxing authorities including the internal revenue service at the federal level with respect to net operating losses that we incurred in and and that we carried back to obtain tentative refunds of federal taxes paid in earlier years dating back to 
in determining whether we are entitled to recognize  and in measuring the level of benefits that we are entitled to recognize associated with  uncertain tax positions  we and experts we have hired to advise us make an evaluation of the technical merits of a tax position derived from sources of authorities in the tax law legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings  and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances underlying our tax position 
although we believe we are several years away from ultimate resolution  and possible settlement and payment  with respect to our uncertain tax positions  including those taken in the and years under audit by the internal revenue service  it is possible that we may ultimately resolve one or more uncertain tax positions in a manner that differs from the liabilities we have recorded associated with such positions under our recognition and measurement determinations 
to the extent that our ultimate resolutions result in less liability than we have recorded associated with our uncertain tax positions  we could experience a material release of liability  increase in income  and greater liquidity than our investors might otherwise expect 
alternatively  to the extent that our ultimate resolutions result in more liability than we have recorded  our results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected
