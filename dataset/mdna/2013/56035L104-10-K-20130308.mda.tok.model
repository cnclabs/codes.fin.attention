table of contents overview we are a principal investment firm primarily focused on providing customized debt and equity financing to lower middle market lmm companies and debt capital to middle market middle market companies 
our portfolio investments are typically made to support management buyouts  recapitalizations  growth financings  refinancings and acquisitions of companies that operate in diverse industry sectors 
we seek to partner with entrepreneurs  business owners and management teams and generally provide one stop financing alternatives within our lmm portfolio 
we invest primarily in secured debt investments  equity investments  warrants and other securities of lmm companies based in the united states and in secured debt investments of middle market companies generally headquartered in the united states 
our principal investment objective is to maximize our portfolio total return by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments  including warrants  convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities in a portfolio company 
our lmm companies generally have annual revenues between million and million  and our lmm portfolio investments generally range in size from million to million 
our middle market investments are made in businesses that are generally larger in size than our lmm portfolio companies  with annual revenues typically between million and billion  and our middle market investments generally range in size from million to million 
our other portfolio other portfolio investments primarily consist of investments which are not consistent with the typical profiles for our lmm and middle market portfolio investments  including investments which may be managed by third parties 
in our other portfolio  we may incur indirect fees and expenses in connection with investments managed by third parties  such as investments in other investment companies or private funds 
we seek to fill the current financing gap for lmm businesses  which  historically  have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources 
the underserved nature of the lmm creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of lmm companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations 
our ability to invest across a company capital structure  from senior secured loans to equity securities  allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing options  or a one stop financing solution 
providing customized  one stop financing solutions has become even more relevant to our lmm portfolio companies in the current investing environment 
we generally seek to partner directly with entrepreneurs  management teams and business owners in making our investments 
our lmm portfolio debt investments are generally secured by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between five and seven years 
we believe that our lmm investment strategy has a lower correlation to the broader debt and equity markets 
as of december   we had debt and equity investments in lmm portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately million  a total cost basis of approximately million  and a weighted average annual effective yield on our lmm debt investments of approximately 
as of december   approximately of our total lmm portfolio investments at cost were in the form of debt investments and approximately of such debt investments at cost were secured by first priority liens on the assets of our lmm portfolio companies 
at december   we had equity ownership in approximately of our lmm portfolio companies and the average fully diluted equity ownership in those portfolio companies was approximately

the weighted average annual yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments as of december  and  including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of 
table of contents original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt investments and any debt investments on non accrual status 
in addition to our lmm investment strategy  we pursue investments in middle market companies 
our middle market portfolio investments primarily consist of direct or secondary investments in interest bearing debt securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included in our lmm portfolio 
our middle market portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and five years 
as of december   we had middle market portfolio investments in companies collectively totaling approximately million in fair value with a total cost basis of approximately million 
the weighted average annual revenue for the middle market portfolio company investments was approximately million as of december  as of december   almost all of our middle market portfolio investments were in the form of debt investments and approximately of such debt investments at cost were secured by first priority liens on portfolio company assets 
the weighted average annual effective yield on our middle market portfolio debt investments was approximately as of december  as of december   we had middle market portfolio investments in companies collectively totaling approximately million in fair value with a total cost basis of approximately million

the weighted average annual effective yield on our middle market portfolio debt investments was approximately as of december  the weighted average annual yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments as of december  and  including amortization of deferred debt origination fees and accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt investments 
as of december   we had other portfolio investments in companies collectively totaling approximately million in fair value and approximately million in cost basis and which comprised of our investment portfolio at fair value as of december  as of december   we had other portfolio investments in companies collectively totaling approximately million in both fair value and cost basis and which comprised of our investment portfolio at fair value as of december  our portfolio investments are generally made through mscc and the funds 
mscc and the funds share the same investment strategies and criteria  although they are subject to different regulatory regimes 
an investor return in mscc will depend  in part  on the funds investment returns as msmf and msc ii are both wholly owned subsidiaries of mscc 
the level of new portfolio investment activity will fluctuate from period to period based upon our view of the current economic fundamentals  our ability to identify new investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria  and our ability to consummate the identified opportunities 
the level of new investment activity  and associated interest and fee income  will directly impact future investment income 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by portfolio companies and the portion of our portfolio debt investments on non accrual status will directly impact future investment income 
while we intend to grow our portfolio and our investment income over the long term  our growth and our operating results may be more limited during depressed economic periods 
however  we intend to appropriately manage our cost structure and liquidity position based on applicable economic conditions and our investment outlook 
the level of realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation will also fluctuate depending upon portfolio activity and the performance of our individual portfolio companies 
the changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results 
mscc and its consolidated subsidiaries are internally managed by the investment manager  a wholly owned subsidiary of mscc  which employs all of the executive officers and other employees of main street 
because the investment manager is wholly owned by mscc  main street does not pay any external 
table of contents investment advisory fees  but instead incurs the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals through the investment manager 
we believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held investment firms which are externally managed  and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio 
for the years ended december  and  the ratio of our total operating expenses  excluding interest expense  as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was and respectively 
in addition  during may  we and the investment manager executed an investment sub advisory agreement with hms adviser  lp  which is the investment advisor to hms income fund  inc  a non publicly traded bdc whose registration statement on form n was declared effective by the sec in june  to provide certain investment advisory services to hms adviser  lp 
we are initially providing such investment advisory services to hms adviser  lp  but ultimately intend that the investment manager provide such services because the fees we receive from such arrangement could otherwise have negative consequences on our ability to meet the source of income requirement necessary for us to maintain our ric tax treatment 
we will need to obtain certain relief from the sec before the investment manager is permitted to provide these services to hms adviser  lp  which we are seeking  but there can be no assurance that we will obtain such relief 
critical accounting policies basis of presentation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
for the three years ended december   and  our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of mscc and its consolidated subsidiaries  which include the funds and the taxable subsidiaries 
portfolio investments  as used herein  refers to all of our portfolio investments in lmm companies  middle market portfolio investments  other portfolio investments and our investment in the investment manager but excludes all of our marketable securities and idle funds investments 
marketable securities and idle funds investments are classified as financial instruments and are reported separately on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated schedule of investments due to the nature of such investments 
our results of operations for the three years ended december   and  cash flows for the three years ended december   and and financial position as of december  and  are presented on a consolidated basis 
the effects of all intercompany transactions between main street and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to conform with the current financial statement presentation  including certain investments previously classified as marketable securities and idle funds investments that are now considered a part of the middle market portfolio and are now classified as non control non affiliate investments 
under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x and the audit and accounting guide for investment companies issued by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa guide  we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments  including those in which we have a controlling interest  unless the portfolio company is another investment company 
an exception to this general principle in the aicpa guide occurs if we own a controlled operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to us  or to an investment company of ours 
none of the investments made by us qualify for this exception 
therefore  our portfolio investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value  as discussed further in note b to our consolidated financial statements  with any adjustments to fair value recognized as net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation on our statement of operations until the investment is realized  usually upon exit  resulting in any gain or loss being recognized as a net realized gain loss from investments 

table of contents portfolio investment valuation the most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our portfolio investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation 
as of december  and  approximately of our total assets at each date represented investments in portfolio companies valued at fair value including our investment in the investment manager 
we are required to report our investments at fair value 
we follow the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification codification or asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value  and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
our business strategy calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid securities issued by private  lmm companies and debt securities issued by middle market companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies 
our portfolio also includes other portfolio investments which primarily consist of investments which are not consistent with the typical profiles for our lmm and middle market portfolio investments  including investments which may be managed by third parties 
all of our portfolio investments may be subject to restrictions on resale 
lmm investments and other portfolio investments generally have no established trading market while middle market securities generally have established markets that are not active 
we determine in good faith the fair value of our portfolio investments pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with asc and a valuation process approved by our board of directors and in accordance with the act 
for lmm investments  we review external events  including private mergers  sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies  and include these events in the valuation process 
for middle market portfolio debt and other portfolio debt investments  we primarily use observable inputs such as quoted prices in the valuation process 
for other portfolio equity investments we generally value such investments based on the fair value of the portfolio company as determined by independent third parties  and based on our proportional ownership in the portfolio company  as well as the financial position and assessed risk of each of these portfolio investments 
our valuation policy and process is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of our portfolio 
for valuation purposes  control lmm portfolio investments are composed of debt and equity securities in companies for which we have a controlling interest in the portfolio company or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company board of directors 
market quotations are generally not readily available for our control lmm portfolio investments 
as a result  for control lmm portfolio investments  we determine the fair value using a combination of market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we will typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of these investments 
the enterprise value is the fair value at which an enterprise could be sold in a transaction between two willing parties  other than through a forced or liquidation sale 
typically  private companies are bought and sold based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  cash flows  net income  revenues  or in limited cases  book value 
there is no single methodology for estimating enterprise value 
for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is generally described as a range of values from which a single estimate of enterprise value is derived 
in estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze various factors  including the portfolio company historical and projected financial results 
we allocate the enterprise value to investments in order of the legal priority of the various components of the portfolio company capital structure 
we will also use the income approach to determine the fair value of these securities  based on projections of the discounted future free cash flows that the portfolio company or the debt security will likely generate  and which includes using a yield to maturity approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows of interest and principal for the debt security  as set forth in the associated loan agreements  as well as the financial position and credit risk of each of these portfolio investments 
the valuation approaches for our control lmm portfolio investments estimate the value of the investment if we were to sell  or exit  the investment 
in addition  these valuation approaches consider the value associated with our ability to control the capital structure of the portfolio company  as well as the timing of a potential exit 

table of contents for valuation purposes  non control lmm portfolio investments are composed of debt and equity securities in companies for which we do not have a controlling interest in the portfolio company or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company board of directors 
market quotations are generally not readily available for non control lmm portfolio investments 
for our non control lmm investments  we use a combination of the market and income approaches to value our equity investments and the income approach to value our debt investments similar to the approaches used for our control lmm portfolio investments  and which includes using a yield to maturity approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows of interest and principal for the debt security  as set forth in the associated loan agreements  as well as the financial position and credit risk of each of these portfolio investments 
our estimate of the expected repayment date of a lmm debt security is generally the legal maturity date of the instrument  as we generally intend to hold our lmm loans and debt securities to maturity 
the yield to maturity analysis considers changes in leverage levels  credit quality  portfolio company performance and other factors 
we will use the value determined by the yield to maturity analysis as the fair value for that security  however  because of our general intent to hold our loans to maturity  the fair value will not exceed the face amount of the lmm debt security 
a change in the assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our lmm debt securities using the yield to maturity analysis could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
if there is deterioration in credit quality or if a lmm debt security is in workout status  we may consider other factors in determining the fair value of the lmm debt security  including the value attributable to the debt security from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would most likely be received in a liquidation analysis 
our middle market portfolio investments primarily consist of direct or secondary investments in interest bearing debt securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included in our investment portfolio 
for valuation purposes  all of our middle market portfolio investments are non control investments for which we do not have a controlling interest in the portfolio company  or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company board of directors 
we primarily use observable inputs to determine the fair value of these investments through obtaining third party quotes or other independent pricing 
for middle market portfolio investments for which sufficient observable inputs are not available to determine fair value  we use a combination of observable inputs through obtaining third party quotes or other independent pricing and an approach that is similar to the income approach using a yield to maturity model used to value our lmm portfolio debt investments 
for valuation purposes  all of our other portfolio investments are non control investments for which we generally do not have a controlling interest in the portfolio company or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company board of directors 
similar to the lmm investment portfolio  market quotations for other portfolio equity investments are generally not readily available 
we value our other portfolio equity investments based on the fair value of the portfolio company as determined by independent third parties and based on our proportional ownership in the portfolio company  as well as the financial position and assessed risk of each of these portfolio investments 
for other portfolio debt investments with observable inputs  we determine the fair value of these investments through obtaining third party quotes or other independent pricing 
to the extent observable inputs are not available for our other portfolio debt investments  we value these other portfolio debt investments through an approach similar to the income approach using a yield to maturity model used to value our non control lmm portfolio debt investments 
due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process  our determination of fair value for our portfolio investments may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
in addition  changes in the market environment  portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned 
we determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation 

table of contents revenue recognition interest and dividend income we record interest and dividend income on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected 
dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution 
in accordance with our valuation policy  we evaluate accrued interest and dividend income periodically for collectability 
when a loan or debt security becomes days or more past due  and if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations  we will generally place the loan or debt security on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
if a loan or debt security status significantly improves regarding the debtor ability to service the debt or other obligations  or if a loan or debt security is fully impaired  sold or written off  we will remove it from non accrual status 
fee income we may periodically provide services  including structuring and advisory services  to our portfolio companies 
for services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value  income is recognized as earned  which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes 
fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are deferred and accreted into interest income over the life of the financing 
payment in kind pik interest and cumulative dividends we hold debt and preferred equity instruments in our investment portfolio that contain payment in kind pik interest and cumulative dividend provisions 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement  is periodically added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income 
thus  the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment 
cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income  and any unpaid dividends are added to the balance of the preferred equity investment 
the actual collection of these dividends may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed 
to maintain ric tax treatment as discussed below  these non cash sources of income may need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions  even though we may not have collected the pik interest and cumulative dividends in cash 
we will stop accruing pik interest and cumulative dividends and will write off any accrued and uncollected interest and dividends in arrears when it is determined that such pik interest and dividends in arrears are no longer collectible 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation plans using the fair value method  as prescribed by asc  compensation stock compensation 
accordingly  for restricted stock awards  we measured the grant date fair value based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant and will amortize this fair value to share based compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
income taxes mscc has elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a ric 
as a ric  mscc generally will not pay corporate level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that mscc distributes to its stockholders as dividends 
mscc must generally distribute at least of its investment company taxable income to qualify for pass through tax treatment and maintain its ric status 
as part of maintaining ric status  undistributed taxable income subject to a excise tax pertaining to a given fiscal year may be distributed up to months subsequent to the end of that fiscal year  provided such dividends are declared prior to the filing of the federal income tax return for the prior year 

table of contents the taxable subsidiaries hold certain portfolio investments for us 
the taxable subsidiaries are consolidated with us for financial reporting purposes  and the portfolio investments held by the taxable subsidiaries are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the principal purpose of the taxable subsidiaries is to permit us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through entities for tax purposes in order to comply with the source income requirements contained in the ric tax provisions of the code 
the taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with us for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense or income tax benefit as a result of their ownership of various portfolio investments 
this income tax expense or benefit  if any  is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
the taxable subsidiaries use the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses 
taxable income generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  as investment gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized 
portfolio investment composition lmm portfolio investments principally consist of secured debt  equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held  lmm companies 
the lmm debt investments are primarily secured by either a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company  generally bear interest at fixed rates  and generally mature between five and seven years from the original investment date 
in most lmm portfolio companies  we also receive nominally priced equity warrants and or make direct equity investments  usually in connection with a debt investment 
middle market portfolio investments primarily consist of direct or secondary investments in interest bearing debt securities in companies that are generally larger in size than the lmm companies included in our lmm portfolio 
our middle market portfolio debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien

our lmm  middle market and other portfolio investments carry a number of risks including  but not limited to investing in lmm  middle market and other portfolio companies which may have limited operating histories and financial resources  holding investments that generally are not publicly traded and which may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale  and other risks common to investing in below investment grade debt and equity investments 
please see risk factors risks related to our investments for a more complete discussion of the risks involved with investing in our portfolio companies 

table of contents portfolio asset quality we utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of each lmm portfolio company and to monitor our expected level of returns on each of our lmm investments in relation to our expectations for the portfolio company 
the investment rating system takes into consideration various factors  including but not limited to each investment expected level of returns and the collectability of our debt investments  comparisons to competitors and other industry participants and the portfolio company future outlook 
investment rating represents a lmm portfolio company that is performing in a manner which significantly exceeds expectations 
investment rating represents a lmm portfolio company that  in general  is performing above expectations 
investment rating represents a lmm portfolio company that is generally performing in accordance with expectations 
investment rating represents a lmm portfolio company that is underperforming expectations 
investments with such a rating require increased monitoring and scrutiny by us 
investment rating represents a lmm portfolio company that is significantly underperforming 
investments with such a rating require heightened levels of monitoring and scrutiny by us and involve the recognition of significant unrealized depreciation on such investment

the broader fundamentals of the united states economy remain mixed  and unemployment remains elevated 
in the event that the united states economy contracts  it is likely that the financial results of small to mid sized companies  like those in which we invest  could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels  which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and an increase in defaults 
consequently  we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain portfolio

due to each of the funds status as a licensed sbic  we have the ability to issue  through the funds  debentures guaranteed by the sba at favorable interest rates 
under the regulations applicable to sbic funds  an sbic can have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the sba generally in an amount up to twice its regulatory capital  which effectively approximates the amount of its equity capital 
debentures guaranteed by the sba have fixed interest rates that equal prevailing year treasury note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi annually 
the principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre paid at any time with no prepayment penalty 
on december   we  through the funds  had million of outstanding indebtedness guaranteed by the sba  which carried a weighted average annual fixed interest rate of approximately 
the first maturity related to the sbic debentures does not occur until  and the remaining weighted average duration is approximately years as of december  during the year ended december   we voluntarily prepaid million of sbic debentures and issued million of new sbic debentures 
we anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents  the liquidation of marketable securities and idle funds investments  and a combination of future debt and equity capital 
our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies  operating expenses and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
we periodically invest excess cash balances into marketable securities and idle funds investments 
the primary investment objective of marketable securities and idle funds investments is to generate incremental cash returns on excess cash balances prior to utilizing those funds for investment in our lmm and middle market portfolio investment strategy 
marketable securities and idle funds investments generally consist of 
table of contents debt investments  independently rated debt investments  certificates of deposit with financial institutions  and diversified bond funds 
the composition of marketable securities and idle funds investments will vary in a given period based upon  among other things  changes in market conditions  the underlying fundamentals in our marketable securities and idle funds investments  our outlook regarding future lmm and middle market portfolio investment needs  and any regulatory requirements applicable to main street 
if our common stock trades below our net asset value per share  we will generally not be able to issue additional common stock at the market price unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our board of directors makes certain determinations 
a proposal  approved by our stockholders at our june annual meeting of stockholders  authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings for the period ending on the earlier of i june   the one year anniversary of our annual meeting of stockholders  or ii the date of our annual meeting of stockholders 
we would need similar future approval from our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share any time after the expiration of the current approval 
we do not currently expect to seek such approval at our annual meeting of stockholders because our common stock price per share has been trading significantly above the current net asset value per share of our common stock 
in order to satisfy the code requirements applicable to a ric  we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income  but we may also elect to periodically spillover certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year 
in addition  as a bdc  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
in january  we received an exemptive order from the sec to exclude sba guaranteed debt securities issued by msmf and any other wholly owned subsidiaries of ours which operate as sbics from the asset coverage requirements of the act as applicable to main street  which  in turn  enables us to fund more investments with debt capital 
although we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity  including recent public stock offerings  our expanded million credit facility  and the available leverage through the sbic program  there is no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms  or at all
