item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors  including those we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our mission is to be the operating system for local commerce 
as part of that vision  we act as a local commerce marketplace that connects merchants to consumers by offering goods and services at a discount 
traditionally  local merchants have tried to reach consumers and generate sales through a variety of methods  including online advertising  the yellow pages  direct mail  newspaper  radio  television  and promotions 
by bringing the brick and mortar world of local commerce onto the internet  groupon is helping local merchant partners to attract customers and sell goods and services 
in our goods category  through which we offer deals on merchandise  we often act as the merchant of record  particularly on deals in north america 
we provide consumers with savings and help them discover what to do  eat  see  buy and where to travel 
each day  we email our subscribers discounted offers on goods  services and travel that are targeted by location  purchase history and personal preferences 
current and potential customers also access our deals directly through our website and mobile applications 
our revenue from deals where we act as the third party marketing agent is the purchase price paid by the customer for a groupon voucher groupon less an agreed upon portion of the purchase price paid to the featured merchant partners  excluding any applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds for which the merchant share is recoverable 
our direct revenue from deals where we act as the merchant of record is the purchase price paid by the customer for the groupon excluding any applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds 
during the year ended december   we generated revenue of  million  compared to  million during the year ended december  we have organized our operations into two principal segments north america  which represents the united states and canada  and international  which represents the rest of our global operations 
for the year ended december   we derived of our revenue from our international segment  compared to from our north america segment 
we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  since our inception  we have driven our growth through substantial investments in infrastructure and marketing to increase customer acquisition 
in particular  our significant net losses in previous years were driven primarily by the rapid expansion of our international segment  which involved investing heavily in upfront marketing  sales and infrastructure related to the build out of our operations in early stage countries 
how we measure our business we measure our business with several financial and operating metrics 
we use these metrics to assess the progress of our business  make decisions on where to allocate capital  time and technology investments and assess the long term performance of our marketplace 
certain of these metrics are reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and certain of these metrics are considered non gaap financial measures 
for further information and a reconciliation to the most applicable financial measure under us gaap  refer to our discussion under non gaap financial measures in the results of operations section 
we have historically presented revenue per average active customer as one of our operating metrics  which we evaluated as an indicator of whether our average customer is purchasing deals with a higher or lower percentage of gross billings retained by groupon 
however  due to the increase in direct revenue as a percentage of total revenue in the current year  we no longer consider this metric to be as meaningful of an indication of those trends because direct revenues are presented on a gross basis 
financial metrics gross billings 
this metric represents the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services  excluding applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds 
for third party revenue deals  gross billings differs from third party revenue reported in our consolidated statements of operations  which are presented net of the merchant share of the transaction price 
for direct revenue deals  gross billings are equivalent to direct revenue reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
we consider this metric to be an important indicator of our growth and business performance as it is a proxy for the dollar volume of transactions through our marketplace 
tracking gross billings on third party revenue deals also allows us to track changes in the percentage of gross billings that we are able to retain after payments to our merchant partners 
revenue 
we believe revenue is an important indicator for our business 
our third party revenue is derived from deals where we act as the marketing agent and is the purchase price paid by the customer for the groupon less an agreed upon portion of the purchase price paid to the featured merchant partner  excluding any applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds for which the merchant share is recoverable 
direct revenue  when the company is selling the product as the merchant of record  is the purchase price paid by the customer  excluding any applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds 
operating loss income excluding stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net 
operating loss income excluding stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net is a non gaap measure that comprises the consolidated total of the segment operating income loss of our two segments  north america and international 
stock based compensation expense and acquisition related expense benefit  net are excluded from segment operating income loss that we report under us gaap for our segments 
stock based compensation expense is primarily a non cash item 
acquisition related expense benefit  net represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements related to business combinations 
we use consolidated operating income loss excluding stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit to allocate resources and evaluate performance internally 
for further information and a reconciliation to the most applicable financial measure under us gaap  refer to our discussion under non gaap financial measures in the results of operations section 
free cash flow 
free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software 
we use free cash flow  and ratios based on it  to conduct and evaluate our business because  although it is similar to cash flow from operations  we believe that it typically represents a more useful measure of cash flows because purchases of fixed assets  software developed for internal use and website development costs are necessary components of our ongoing operations 
free cash flow is not intended to represent the total increase or decrease in groupon cash balance for the applicable period 
for further information and a reconciliation to the most applicable financial measure under us gaap  refer to our discussion under non gaap financial measures in the results of operations section 
operating metrics active customers 
we define active customers as unique user accounts that have purchased groupons during the trailing twelve months ttm 
we consider this metric to be an important indicator of our business performance as it helps us to understand how the number of customers actively purchasing groupons is trending 
gross billings per average active customer 
this metric represents the trailing twelve months gross billings generated per average active customer 
this metric is calculated as the total gross billings generated in the trailing twelve months  divided by the average number of active customers in such time period 
although we believe total gross billings  not trailing twelve months gross billings per average active customer  is a better indication of the overall growth of our marketplace over time  trailing twelve months gross billings per average active customer provides an opportunity to evaluate whether our growth is primarily driven by growth in total customers or in spend per customer in any given period 
year ended december  gross billings and operating metrics gross billings in thousands ttm active customers in thousands ttm gross billings per average active customer reflects the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services  excluding applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds 
reflects the total number of unique accounts that have purchased groupons during the trailing twelve months 
reflects the total gross billings generated in the trailing twelve months per average active customer in the applicable period 
factors affecting our performance deal sourcing and quality 
we consider our merchant partner relationships to be a vital part of our business model and have made significant investments in order to expand the variety of tools that we can provide to our merchant partners 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain merchants that are prepared to offer products or services on compelling terms  particularly as we attempt to expand our product and service offerings in order to create a more complete online marketplace for local commerce 
we generally do not have long term arrangements to guarantee availability of deals that offer attractive quality  value and variety to consumers or favorable payment terms to us 
if new merchants do not find our marketing and promotional services effective  or if our existing merchants do not believe that utilizing our services provides them with a long term increase in customers  revenue or profit  they may stop making offers through our marketplace 
international operations 
our international operations are critical to our revenue growth and our ability to achieve and maintain profitability 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our revenue was generated from our international segment 
operating a global business requires management attention and resources and requires us to localize our services to conform to a wide variety of local cultures  business practices  laws and policies 
the different commercial and internet infrastructure in other countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our current and future business model 
the increase in direct revenue transactions in north america contributed to the decrease in international revenue as a percentage of our total revenue during  as direct revenue is presented on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations 
marketing costs 
we must continue to acquire and retain customers who purchase groupons in order to increase revenue and achieve profitability 
if consumers do not perceive our groupon offerings to be attractive  or if we fail to introduce new or more relevant deals  we may not be able to acquire or retain customers 
in our limited operating history  we have not incurred significant marketing or other expense on initiatives designed to re activate customers or increase the level of purchases by our existing customers 
as we incur such expenditures  our business and profitability could be adversely affected 
investment in growth 
we have been a high growth company and have aggressively invested  and intend to continue to invest  to support this growth 
for example  we are developing a suite of merchant products  such as payment processing and point of sale  which require substantial investment and these products do not currently generate a material amount of revenue 
we anticipate that we will make substantial investments in the foreseeable future as we continue to increase the number and variety of deals we offer each day  broaden our customer base  expand our marketing channels  expand our operations  hire additional employees and develop our technology 
competitive pressure 
our growth and geographical expansion have drawn a significant amount of attention to our business model 
as a result  a substantial number of companies that attempt to replicate our business model have emerged around the world 
we expect new competitors to emerge 
in addition to such competitors  we expect to increasingly compete against other large internet and technology based businesses that have launched initiatives which are directly competitive to our core business as well as our other categories and our suite of merchant products  such as payment processing and point of sale 
we also expect to compete against other internet sites that are focused on specific communities or interests and offer coupons or discount arrangements related to such communities or interests

through our daily emails  we have been increasingly targeting customers by sending them deals for specific locations and personal preferences  which we believe contributed to revenue growth

the unfavorable impact on revenue from year over year changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december  was million 
third party revenue third party revenue increased by million to  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million for the year ended december  several initiatives have driven third party revenue growth during this year 
we added to our sales force in early  allowing us to increase the number of merchant partner relationships and the volume of deals we offer on a daily basis to our customers on our websites and mobile applications 
the launch of our goods category in the second half of also contributed to the growth in third party revenue during  because goods transactions where the company is acting as a marketing agent of the merchant are reported on a net basis within third party revenue 
direct revenue direct revenue was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  due to the launch of goods in the second half of we are often the merchant of record for transactions in the goods category  such that the resulting revenue is reported on a gross basis within direct revenue 
direct revenue deals have continued to grow  both overall and as a percentage of our revenue  through the continued growth of our goods category and we expect that trend to continue 
in addition  we expect that any growth in direct revenue will result in a smaller percentage increase in income from operations than growth in third party revenue because direct revenue includes the entire amount of gross billings  before deducting the cost of the related inventory  while third party revenue is net of the merchant share of the transaction price

additionally  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue for our international segment was significantly higher than for our north america segment  which contributed to larger operating losses in our international segment 
this was primarily a result of the build out of our international operations  including our salesforce 
wages and benefits excluding stock based compensation increased by million to million in the year ended december  as we continued to add sales force and administrative staff to support our business 
stock based compensation costs also increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to awards issued to retain key employees and awards issued in connection with our acquisitions 
our consulting and professional fees increased in primarily related to higher legal and technology related costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in primarily because we recorded million of intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions in  resulting in an increase of amortization expense of million 
in addition  recognizing a full year of amortization for intangibles recorded in in connections with acquisitions resulted in an additional million of amortization 
acquisition related expense benefit  net compared to for the years ended december  and  we incurred net acquisition related expenses of million and benefits of million  respectively  representing changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities from business acquisitions 
see note fair value measurements 
the expense incurred in is net of a million benefit recognized for the current year declines in the fair value of certain of our contingent consideration arrangements 
compared to for the years ended december  and  our acquisition related expense benefit was a million net benefit and a million net expense  respectively 
the fluctuation in the costs were directly related to changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements  as well as realized gains and losses on those arrangements  for acquisitions in the respective periods 
during  we acquired several companies that were either technology based companies or other group buying companies in an effort to increase our competitive advantage both domestically and internationally 
as part of the overall consideration paid in connection with these acquisitions  we were obligated to issue additional shares of our class a common stock and make cash payments if certain financial and performance earn out targets were achieved 
we recorded liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet of million as of the original acquisition dates for these contingent consideration arrangements and subsequently remeasured the liabilities to fair value  with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
as a result of this remeasurment  we recorded a net gain of million for the year ended december  in may  we acquired citydeal  a european based collective buying power business similar to ours 
as part of the overall consideration paid  we were obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock in december due to the achievement of financial and performance earn out targets 
we recorded a liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of the original acquisition date for this consideration and subsequently remeasured the liability to its fair value on a periodic basis until final settlement 
as a result of this remeasurement  we recorded a total expense of million for the year ended december  as acquisition related expenses  which was partially offset by other nominal acquisition related items 
this liability is settled and is no longer subject to future remeasurement 
income loss from operations we earned million of income from operations for the year ended december   as compared to losses from operations for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
the change to income from operations from loss from operations in the comparable years of and is primarily due to increased revenue and reduced marketing expenses in  partially offset by increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  a significant driver of the loss from operations in was the million acquisition related expense 
this was primarily related to the contingent consideration arrangement on the city deal acquisition  which was settled in late the unfavorable impact on income from operations from year over year changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december  was million 
compared to income from operations increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to a loss from operations of million for the year ended december  we recognized income from operations for the year ended december  due to the increase in revenue and decrease in marketing expense  partially offset by increases in cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expense 
north america segment operating income in our north america segment  which excludes stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net  increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the segment operating income was primarily attributable to our increased revenues within north america  particularly from our goods category 
international segment operating income in our international segment  which excludes stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net  increased by million to million of segment operating income for the year ended december   as compared to million of segment operating loss for the year ended december  the international segment operating loss in the year ended december  was driven by our rapid expansion in the segment during that year 
in the year ended december   we have generated segment operating income as result of increased revenue  partially offset by increased cost of revenue and operating expenses 
compared to loss from operations decreased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the most significant driver of this improvement was a reduction in acquisition related expense benefit from a million expense in  primarily related to the contingent consideration arrangement on the city deals acquisition  to a million benefit in north america segment operating income for our north america segment  which excludes stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net  increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to a segment operating loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in the segment operating income was primarily attributable to our expansion within north america

international segment operating loss for our international segment  which excludes stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net  decreased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the international segment operating loss was driven by our rapid expansion in the segment during the year 
in  we made significant marketing investments in our international segment to accelerate growth and establish our presence in new markets 
as a result  we experienced operating losses for our international segment as compared to operating income for our north america segment 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  consists of foreign currency transaction gains or losses  interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and other non operational gains and losses

as of december   unamortized tax effects of intercompany transactions of million and million are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other non current assets  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheet 
we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate in future periods will continue to differ significantly from the us federal income tax rate as a result of our tax obligations in jurisdictions with profits and valuation allowances in jurisdictions with losses 
our consolidated effective tax rate in future periods will also be adversely impacted by the amortization of the tax effects of intercompany transactions  including intercompany sales of intellectual property that we expect to undertake in the future

operating income loss excluding stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net 
operating income loss excluding stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net is a non gaap measure that comprises the consolidated total of the segment operating income loss of our two segments  north america and international 
stock based compensation expense and acquisition related benefit expense  net are excluded from segment operating income loss that we report under us gaap for our segments 
stock based compensation expense is primarily a non cash item 
acquisition related expense benefit  net represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements related to business combinations 
we use consolidated operating income loss excluding stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net to allocate resources and evaluate performance internally 
we consider operating income loss excluding stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net to be an important measure for management to evaluate the performance of our business as it excludes changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to business combinations and stock based compensation expenses 
we believe it is important to view operating income loss excluding stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of operations 
when evaluating our performance  you should consider operating income loss excluding stock based compensation and acquisition related expense benefit  net as a complement to other financial performance measures  including various cash flow metrics  net income loss and our other us gaap results

free cash flow 
free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  equipment and software  net 
we use free cash flow  and ratios based on it  to conduct and evaluate our business because  although it is similar to cash flow from operations  we believe that it typically represents a more useful measure of cash flows because purchases of fixed assets  software developed for internal use and website development costs are necessary components of our ongoing operations 
free cash flow is not intended to represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the applicable period 
free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures 
for example  free cash flow does not include the cash payments for business acquisitions 
in addition  free cash flow reflects the impact of the timing difference between when we are paid by customers and when we pay merchant partners and suppliers 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents  which primarily consisted of cash  money market accounts and overnight securities 
since our inception  we have funded our working capital requirements and expansion primarily with cash flows from operations and through public and private sales of common and preferred stock  which have yielded net proceeds of approximately  million 
we generated positive cash flow from operations for the years ended december   and  and we expect cash flow from operations to remain positive in the foreseeable future 
we generally use this cash flow to fund our operations  make additional acquisitions  purchase capital assets and meet our other cash operating needs 
cash flow from operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december  to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no us income taxes have been provided thereon 
as of december   the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in jurisdictions for which we have indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately million 
we have not  nor do we anticipate the need to  repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business 
although we can provide no assurances  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents balance and cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and other capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
anticipated uses of cash our priority in is to continue to aggressively invest in the business by making additional investments in technology and innovations and by continuing to shift our marketing spend from customer acquisition to customer activation in both our north america and international segments 
in addition  we plan to continue to acquire or make strategic minority investments in complementary businesses that add to our customer base or provide incremental technology or talent or both 
in order to support our overall global expansion  we expect to continue to make significant investments in our corporate facilities and technology development during during the year ended december   we acquired businesses for an aggregate purchase price of million  of which million was paid for in cash net of cash acquired  and we expect to continue to use cash to make strategic acquisitions 
we currently plan to fund these investments in our north america and international segments with our available cash and cash equivalents balance and cash flows generated from the respective operations 
we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future

our current merchant partner arrangements are structured as either a redemption payment model or a fixed payment model defined as follows redemption payment model under our redemption merchant partner payment model  we collect payments at the time our customers purchase groupons and make payments to our merchant partners at a subsequent date 
using this payment model  merchant partners are not paid until the customer redeems the groupon that has been purchased 
if a customer does not redeem the groupon under this payment model  we retain all of the gross billings from the unredeemed groupon 
the redemption model generally improves our overall cash flow because we do not pay our merchant partners until the customer redeems the groupon 
fixed payment model under our fixed merchant partner payment model  we generally pay our merchant partners in installments over a period of sixty days for third party revenue deals 
however  for third party revenue deals in which the merchant partner has a continuous presence on our websites and mobile applications by offering vouchers on a rolling basis for an extended period of time  we generally remit payments to the merchant on an ongoing basis throughout the term of the offering 
for direct revenue deals  we generally have net day payment terms with our suppliers 
under the fixed payment model  merchant partners are paid regardless of whether the groupon is redeemed 
we experience swings in merchant and supplier payables associated with our normal revenue generating activities  including both third party and direct revenue sales transactions  that can cause volatility in working capital levels and impact cash balances more or less than our operating income or loss would indicate 
in the current year  we have offered certain merchant partners more favorable and accelerated payment terms  which has reduced our overall cash flow benefits from the timing differences between when we receive cash from customers and remit payments to our merchant partners 
we expect that trend to continue in the future

contingent consideration represents our best estimate of the cash payments we will be obligated to make under contingent consideration arrangements with former owners of certain entities we acquired if specified operating objectives and financial results are achieved by those acquired entities 
our maximum cash payments under those arrangements are as follows million in and million in off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states  or us gaap  requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities  revenue and expense  and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec has defined a company critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions  and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments  or conditions 
revenue we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
third party revenue recognition we generate third party revenue  where we act as the third party marketing agent  by offering goods and services provided by third party merchant partners at a discount through our local commerce marketplace that connects merchants to consumers 
our marketplace includes deals offered through a variety of categories including local  national  goods  getaways and live 
customers purchase the discount vouchers groupons from us and redeem them with our merchant partners 
the revenue recognition criteria are met when the number of customers who purchase a given deal exceeds the predetermined threshold where applicable  the groupon has been electronically delivered to the purchaser and a listing of groupons sold has been made available to the merchant 
at that time  our obligations to the merchant  for which we are serving as a marketing agent  are substantially complete 
our remaining obligations  which are limited to remitting payment to the merchant and continuing to make available on our website information about groupons sold that was previously provided to the merchant  are inconsequential or perfunctory 
we record as revenue the net amount we retain from the sale of groupons after deducting the portion of the purchase price that is payable to the featured merchant  excluding any applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds for which the merchant share is recoverable 
revenue is recorded on a net basis because we are acting as a marketing agent of the merchant in the transaction 
for merchant payment arrangements that are structured under a redemption model  merchant partners are not paid until the customer redeems the groupon that has been purchased 
if a customer does not redeem the groupon under this payment model  we retain all the gross billings 
we record revenue from unredeemed groupons and derecognize the related accrued merchant payable when our legal obligation to the merchant expires  which we believe is shortly after deal expiration in most jurisdictions that have payment arrangements structured under a redemption model 
however  prior to  we had historically concluded based on our interpretation of applicable german law that our obligation to merchants in that jurisdiction extended for three years 
due to a recent german tax ruling  which requires us to remit value added taxes vat earlier on unredeemed groupons  we began recognizing revenue from unredeemed groupons in germany shortly after deal expiration during  consistent with most other jurisdictions 
as a result  the quarter ended september  included an million one time increase to third party revenue  which represented the cumulative impact of deals in germany for which  based on the recent tax ruling  our obligation to the merchant would have ended prior to that quarterly period ie  prior to july  
direct revenue recognition we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of our sales and related costs by considering a number of factors  including  among other things  whether we are the primary obligor under the arrangement  have inventory risk  and have latitude in establishing prices 
direct revenue is derived primarily from selling products through our goods category where we are the merchant of record 
we are the primary obligor in these transactions  are subject to general inventory risk and have latitude in establishing prices 
accordingly  direct revenue is recorded on a gross basis  excluding any applicable taxes and net of estimated refunds 
for purposes of evaluating whether product revenue should be recognized on a gross basis  unmitigated general inventory risk is a strong indicator of whether a seller has the risks and rewards of a principal to the sale transaction 
us gaap specifies that general inventory risk exists if a seller either takes title to a product before that product is ordered by a customer that is  maintains the product in inventory or will take title to the product if it is returned by the customer that is  back end inventory risk and the customer has a right of return 
we have unmitigated general inventory risk on all of our direct revenue 
currently  that general inventory risk is primarily in the form of back end inventory risk  as the amount of inventory that we maintain on hand has not been significant in relation to the amount of our direct revenue 
however  we had million of inventory on hand at december   and in future periods we may continue to increase the levels of inventory on hand for our goods category 
for goods transactions where we are performing a service by acting as a marketing agent of the merchant  revenue is recorded on a net basis and is presented within third party revenue 
direct revenue  including associated shipping revenue  is recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers 
discounts we provide discounts offers to encourage purchases of goods and services through our marketplace 
on third party revenue transactions  discounts provided to purchasers of groupons reduce the net amount that we retain after paying a portion of the purchase price to the merchant 
we record discounts as a reduction of revenue 
refunds we estimate future refunds utilizing a statistical model that incorporates the following data inputs and factors historical refund experience developed from millions of deals featured on our website  the relative risk of refunds based on expiration date  deal value  deal category and other qualitative factors that could impact the level of future refunds  such as introductions of new deals  discontinuations of legacy deals  and expected changes  if any  in our practices in response to refund experience or economic trends that might impact customer demand 
the portion of customer refunds for which the merchant share is not recoverable on third party revenue deals is estimated based on the refunds that are expected to be issued after expiration of the related vouchers  the refunds that are expected to be issued due to merchant bankruptcy or poor customer experience  and whether the payment terms of the related merchant contracts are structured using a redemption payment model or a fixed payment model 
in early  actual refund activity for deals featured late in l was demonstrating a consistent trend that was deviating from the modeled refund behavior  due in part to a shift in fourth quarter deal mix and higher price point offers 
accordingly  we updated our refund model to better capture variations in trends in its business 
by continually refining the refund model to reflect such data inputs as discussed above  we believe that our model enables us to track and anticipate refund behavior 
we accrue costs associated with refunds within accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
the cost of refunds for third party revenue where the amounts payable to the merchant are recoverable and for all direct revenue is presented on the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to revenue 
the cost of refunds for third party revenue for which the merchant share is not recoverable is presented as a cost of revenue 
we assess the trends that could affect our estimates on an ongoing basis and make adjustments to the refund reserve calculations if it appears that changes in circumstances  including changes to the company refund policies  may cause future refunds to differ from our original estimates 
if actual results are not consistent with the estimates or assumptions stated above  we may need to change our future estimates  and the effects could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations and impairment assessments of goodwill and long lived assets a component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations 
we account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the purchase date 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations and for determining fair values in impairment tests  we use one of the following recognized valuation methods the income approach including discounted cash flows  the market approach and the cost approach 
our significant estimates in those fair value measurements include identifying business factors such as size  growth  profitability  risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples 
further  when measuring fair value based on discounted cash flows  we make assumptions about risk adjusted discount rates  future price levels  rates of increase in revenue  cost of revenue  and operating expenses  weighted average cost of capital  rates of long term growth  and income tax rates 
valuations are performed by management or independent valuation specialists under management supervision  where appropriate 
we believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and for determining fair value in business combinations and impairment tests are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use 
however  such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates 
goodwill is allocated to our four reporting units north america  emea  apac and latam  at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units  it no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition and becomes identified with the reporting unit in its entirety 
accordingly  the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole is available to support the recoverability of its goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on october or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its book value  the related goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step is performed 
when required  the second step of testing involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination  which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of its net assets and identifiable intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for reporting units with a negative book value ie  excess of liabilities over assets  we evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
as of october   liabilities exceeded assets for our emea and latam reporting units 
due to the significant decline in our overall market capitalization  the challenging economic conditions in europe applicable to our emea reporting unit  and other qualitative factors  we determined that the second step should be performed in connection with the october  goodwill impairment tests for our emea and latam reporting units 
the goodwill allocated to our emea and latam reporting units was million and million  respectively  as of the testing date 
the goodwill allocated to the emea reporting unit primarily arose from our may acquisition of citydeal europe gmbh citydeal  whose collective buying business had been launched in january no goodwill impairment was recognized for any of our reporting units in connection with our october  annual test 
as of october   our market capitalization of billion substantially exceeded our consolidated net book value of million 
long lived assets  such as property  equipment and software  net and intangible assets  net  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
if circumstances require that a long lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment  we first compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that long lived asset or asset group to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
future changes in our assumptions or the interrelationship of those assumptions may negatively impact future valuations 
in future measurements of fair value  adverse changes in assumptions could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets that would require a non cash charge to the consolidated statements of operations and may have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we regularly review deferred tax assets to assess whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and  if necessary  establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value 
for purposes of assessing whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized  we consider the following four sources of taxable income for each tax jurisdiction a future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  b projected future earnings  c taxable income in carryback years  to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under the tax laws of the applicable jurisdiction  and d tax planning strategies  which represent prudent and feasible actions that a company ordinarily might not take  but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused 
to the extent that evidence about one or more of these sources of taxable income is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary  other sources need not be considered 
otherwise  evidence about each of the sources of taxable income is considered in arriving at a conclusion about the need for and amount of a valuation allowance 
we have incurred significant losses in recent years and had accumulated deficits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
consequently  we have only recognized deferred tax assets to the extent that they will be realizable either through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences or through taxable income in carryback years for the applicable jurisdictions 
due to our cumulative losses  we have recognized valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that are not supported by those objective sources of taxable income 
as of december  and  we have not recognized deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance when the only sources of taxable income are projected future earnings or tax planning strategies 
for certain jurisdictions where applicable tax law imposes limitations that may prevent us from realizing our deferred tax assets through the scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences  we have recorded valuation allowances in excess of the net deferred tax asset balances 
a change in the assumptions used to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets could cause an increase or decrease to the valuation allowance and  consequently  our effective tax rate  which could materially impact our results of operations 
we are subject to taxation in the united states  various state and foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related income tax assets and liabilities 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
for example  our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in the relevant tax  accounting and other laws  regulations  principles and interpretations 
our practice for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes is to recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not criteria  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
we are subject to audit in various jurisdictions  and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of any tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from income tax provision accruals and  therefore  could materially affect our operating results or cash flows in the period s in which that determination is made 
other than temporary impairment of investments an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an investment is less than its amortized cost basis 
we conduct periodic reviews of all of our investments with unrealized losses to evaluate whether those impairments are other than temporary 
this evaluation  which is performed at the individual investment level  consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss  as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time that is sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value 
evidence considered in this evaluation includes the amount of the impairment  the length of time that the investment has been impaired  the factors contributing to the impairment  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  recent operating trends and forecasted performance of the investee  market conditions in the geographic area or industry in which the investee operates  and our strategic plans for holding the investment in relation to the period of time expected for an anticipated recovery in value 
additionally  we consider whether we intend to sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million other than temporary impairment of f tuan  a cost method investment with operations in china 
we obtained this investment in june as part of a transaction in which we received a interest in f tuan  in the form of common and series e preferred shares  in exchange for our interest in e commerce  an equity method investment with operations in china  and an additional million of cash consideration 
we recognized a million non operating gain as a result of this transaction  which represented the excess of the acquisition date fair value of the interest in f tuan that we acquired over the carrying value of our investment in e commerce and the million of cash consideration 
the million acquisition date fair value of our investment in f tuan  a nonpublic entity  was determined using the discounted cash flow method  which is an income approach  and the resulting value was corroborated using the market approach 
the inputs used to estimate fair value under the discounted cash flow method included financial projections and the discount rate 
because these fair value inputs are unobservable  fair value measurements of our investment in f tuan are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
in connection with the acquisition date fair value measurement of f tuan  we obtained financial projections from the investee 
we evaluated those financial projections and based on our knowledge of the business and related market conditions 
as a result of our evaluations  downward adjustments were applied to reduce the anticipated growth that was reflected in the original projections 
we applied a discount rate to the adjusted cash flow projections  which included an entity specific risk premium to account for the riskiness and uncertainty inherent in the business 
additionally  we corroborated the acquisition date fair value measurement of f tuan by estimating the fair value of our interest in e commerce at the time of the transaction and comparing the estimated fair value of the consideration we transferred  including the additional million of cash consideration  to the estimated fair value of the investment in f tuan that we obtained 
in january  we obtained updated financial projections from the investee  as well as their operating results for the year ended december  the investee operating loss for the year ended december  was lower than the loss that was forecasted at the time of our investment  primarily due to lower than forecasted operating expenses 
however  actual revenues were lower than the adjusted financial projections used at the time of our investment and the updated financial projections provided by the investee at year end indicated significant declines in forecasted revenues in future years as compared to the adjusted financial projections used at the time of our investment due to reduced gross billings and deal margin forecasts 
as of december   we continued to apply a discounted cash flow approach  corroborated by a market approach  to estimate the fair value of our investment in f tuan 
for the december  fair value measurement  we used the updated financial projections and a discount rate of 
the increase to the discount rate as compared to the acquisition date fair value measurement was primarily attributable to an increase in the entity specific risk premium to reflect our current assessment of the riskiness of this investment 
the resulting fair value measurement of our investment in f tuan was million as of december   a million reduction from the million fair value measurement at the time of our initial investment in june our evaluation of other than temporary impairments involves consideration of qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss  as well as the company intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time that is sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value 
although our investment in f tuan has not been in an unrealized loss position for an extended period of time and we have no current plans to dispose of this investment  we concluded that the impairment is other than temporary due to the significant declines in forecasted revenue growth and the severity of the unrealized loss as of december  we have recorded the million other than temporary impairment of our investment in f tuan within interest and other income  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december we also recorded an additional million other than temporary impairment of an equity method investment in a nonpublic entity  which is reported within loss on equity method investees in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation cost at fair value  net of estimated forfeitures 
expense is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the service period during which awards are expected to vest  except for awards with performance conditions  which are recognized using the accelerated method 
we include stock based compensation expense within cost of revenue  marketing and selling  general and administrative on our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
prior to the initial public offering  determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date required judgment 
we have not granted any stock options subsequent to june  for the stock options that we granted up to that date  we used the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value 
the determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option pricing model was affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables 
these other variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options  stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends  which were estimated as follows fair value of our common stock 
prior to our initial public offering in november  our stock had not been publicly traded and we estimated the fair value of common stock as discussed in common stock valuations below 
expected term 
the expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and was based on the simplified method allowed under sec guidance 
we used the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options 
volatility 
because we did not have a trading history prior to november for our common stock  the expected stock price volatility was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for publicly traded options of comparable industry peers similar in size  stage of life cycle and financial leverage  based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants 
we did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers common stock because the volume of activity was relatively low 
risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate was based on the yields of us treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group 
dividend yield 
we do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we used an expected dividend yield of zero 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes merton model changes significantly  stock based compensation for any future stock option awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously 
we did not grant any stock options during the year ended december  the following table presents the weighted average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the years ended december  and dividend yield risk free interest rate expected term in years expected volatility common stock valuations the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors  or the board  which intended that all options granted were exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant 
the assumptions we used in the valuation model were based on future expectations combined with management judgment 
in the absence of a public trading market prior to our initial public offering in november  the board  with input from management  exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of the date of each option grant  including the following factors the prices  rights  preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to the common stock  the prices of our preferred stock sold to outside investors in arms length transactions  our operating and financial performance  current business conditions and projections  the hiring of key personnel  the history of our company and the introduction of new products and services  our stage of development  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options  such as an initial public offering or sale of our company  given prevailing market conditions  any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our common stock  the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies  and the us and global capital market conditions 
we granted stock options with the following exercise price ranges each quarter since the beginning of three months ended shares underlying options weighted average exercise price march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  march  june  the  options granted in the three months ended june  have an exercise price of because they were granted as part of a settlement agreement with a former employee 
the exercise price of these options represents the fair value of the stock when the employee left the company 
recently issued accounting standards there are no accounting standards that have been issued but not yet adopted that we believe will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have operations both within the united states and internationally  and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business  including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  interest rate changes and inflation 
information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is set forth below 
foreign currency exchange risk we transact business in various foreign currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen and brazilian real  which exposes us to foreign currency risk 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from our international segment 
revenue and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries 
the functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these markets is generally the same as the corresponding local currency 
the results of operations of  and certain of our intercompany balances associated with  our international operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
upon consolidation  as exchange rates vary  our revenue and other operating results may differ materially from expectations  and we may record significant gains or losses on the re measurement of intercompany balances 
we assess our foreign currency exchange risk based on hypothetical changes in rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential impact on working capital based on a change increase and decrease in currency rates 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures as of december  and as of december   our net working capital deficit defined as current assets less current liabilities from subsidiaries that are subject to foreign currency translation risk was million 
the potential increase in this working capital deficit from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be million 
this compares to a million working capital deficit subject to foreign currency exposure at december   for which a adverse change would have resulted in a potential increase in this working capital deficit of million 
the primary difference between foreign currency exposure from december  to december  is due to fluctuations in foreign currencies against the us dollar during and improvements in working capital deficit over the year 
interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of cash and money market funds 
we currently do not have long term borrowings except for million of long term capital lease obligations  which do not expose us to significant interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is limited because nearly all of our cash and cash equivalents have a short term maturity and are used primarily for working capital purposes 
in november  we purchased a convertible debt security issued by an nonpublic entity for million and have classified the security as available for sale 
the interest rate risk on this security is not significant 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations in  or
