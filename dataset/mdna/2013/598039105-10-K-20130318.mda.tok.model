item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents under the risk based capital requirements for bank holding companies and financial holding companies  the minimum requirement for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the total capital as defined below is to be composed of common stockholders equity  retained earnings  qualifying perpetual preferred stock in a limited amount in the case of cumulative preferred stock  minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and qualifying trust preferred securities  less goodwill and certain intangibles tier capital 
the remainder of total capital may consist of qualifying subordinated debt and redeemable preferred stock  qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and allowance for loan losses tier capital  and together with tier capital  total capital 
at december   our tier capital ratio was and total capital ratio was 
as long as our total consolidated assets remain below billion  under current capital standards we may continue to include our million aggregate principal amount of trust preferred securities issued prior to may  in our tier and total capital calculations 
the federal reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies and financial holding companies 
these requirements provide for a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets leverage ratio equal to for bank holding companies and financial holding companies that meet specified criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating 
all other bank holding companies and financial holding companies will generally be required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 
our leverage ratio at december  was 
the capital guidelines also provide that bank holding companies and financial holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
furthermore  the guidelines provide that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio deducting all intangibles in evaluating proposals for expansion or to engage in new activity 
the bank is subject to similar capital requirements adopted by the occ 
the risk based capital requirements identify concentrations of credit risk and certain risks arising from non traditional activities  and the management of those risks  as important factors to consider in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
other factors taken into consideration by federal regulators include interest rate exposure  liquidity  funding and market risk  the quality and level of earnings  the quality of loans and investments  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control financial and operational risks  including the risks presented by concentrations of credit and non traditional activities 
basel iii capital framework in june  the federal bank regulatory agencies proposed i rules to implement the basel iii capital framework as outlined by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee and ii rules for calculating risk weighted assets 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have delayed the implementation of basel iii and the new risk weighted assets calculations to consider comments received on the proposed rules 
the timing for the agencies publication of revised proposed rules regarding  or final rules to implement  basel iii and the new risk weighted assets calculations is uncertain 
basel iii  when implemented by the us banking agencies and fully phased in  will require bank holding companies and financial holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital  with a greater emphasis on common equity 
the basel iii final capital framework  among other things  i introduces as a new capital measure common equity tier cet  ii specifies that tier capital consists of cet and additional tier capital instruments meeting specified requirements  iii defines cet narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet and not to the other components of capital and iv expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations 
when fully phased in  basel iii would require banks to maintain i as a newly adopted international standard  a minimum ratio of cet to risk weighted assets of at least  plus a capital conservation buffer which is added to the cet ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of cet to risk weighted assets of at least  ii a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least  plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the tier capital ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum tier capital ratio of upon full implementation  iii a minimum ratio of total that is  tier plus tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least  plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of upon full implementation and iv as a newly adopted international standard  a minimum leverage ratio of  calculated as the ratio of tier capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off balance sheet exposures computed as the average for each quarter of the month end ratios for the quarter 

table of contents basel iii also provides for a countercyclical capital buffer  generally designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk 
this buffer would be a cet add on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of to when fully implemented potentially resulting in total buffers of between and 
the basel iii final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to cet these include  for example  the requirement that mortgage servicing rights  deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non consolidated financial entities be deducted from cet to the extent that any one such category exceeds of cet or all such categories in the aggregate exceed of cet implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet are currently expected to be phased in over a five year period per year 
the implementation of the capital conservation buffer is expected to begin at and be phased in over a four year period increasing by that amount each year until it reaches 
the regulations ultimately applicable to the company may be substantially different from the basel iii proposed rules that were issued in june requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact our net income and return on equity 
prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions 
under this system  the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  and are required to take certain mandatory supervisory actions  and are authorized to take other discretionary actions  with respect to institutions in the three undercapitalized categories 
the severity of the action will depend upon the capital category in which the institution is placed 
generally  subject to a narrow exception  the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized 
the federal banking agencies have set the relevant capital level for each category 
an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal regulatory agency 
a bank holding company and financial holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan  subject to certain limitations 
the controlling holding company obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of of an undercapitalized subsidiary assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements 
an undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets  making acquisitions  establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business  except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with fdic approval 
in addition  the appropriate federal regulatory agency may treat an undercapitalized institution in the same manner as it treats a significantly undercapitalized institution if it determines that those actions are necessary 
at december   the bank had the requisite capital level to qualify as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
insurance of accounts and fdic insurance assessments the bank s deposits are insured by the deposit insurance fund the dif of the fdic up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit insurance ownership category 
as of january   the basic limit on fdic deposit insurance coverage is  per depositor 
under the fdia  the fdic may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic  subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes 
the dif is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions 
as required by the dodd frank act  in february  the fdic approved a final rule that changed the assessment base for dif assessments from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity defined as tier capital 
in addition  as also required by the dodd frank act  the fdic has adopted a new large bank pricing assessment scheme  set a current target designated reserve ratio described in more detail below of for the dif  and established a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches and  in lieu of dividends  provides for a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches and 

table of contents an institution s assessment rate depends upon the institution s assigned risk category  which is based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
initial base assessment rates ranged from to basis points 
the fdic may make the following further adjustments to an institution s initial base assessment rates decreases for long term unsecured debt  including most senior unsecured debt and subordinated debt  increases for holding long term unsecured debt or subordinated debt issued by other insured depository institutions  and increases for broker deposits in excess of of domestic deposits for insurances not well rated and well capitalized 
as of december   our risk category required a quarterly payment of approximately basis points per of assessable deposits 
the dodd frank act transferred to the fdic increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the dif  or the designated reserve ratio 
among other changes  the dodd frank act i raised the minimum designated reserve ratio to and removed the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio  ii requires that the designated reserve ratio reach by september  and iii requires the fdic to offset the effect on institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion of increasing of raising the designated reserve ratio from to 
the fdia requires that the fdic consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis 
in october  the fdic adopted a new dif restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches by september   as required by the dodd frank act 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses the alll represents one of the most significant estimates in the bank s financial statements and regulatory reports 
because of its significance  the bank has established a system by which it develops  maintains  and documents a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process for determining the amounts of the alll and the provision for loan and lease losses 
the interagency policy statement on the alll encourages all banks and federal savings institutions to ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the alll in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  the federal savings association s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the bank s estimate of credit losses reflects consideration of significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
safety and soundness standards the federal deposit insurance act  as amended by the fdicia and the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards  by regulations or guidelines  relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  stock valuation and compensation  fees and benefits  and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards pursuant to fdicia  as amended 
the guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth and compensation and fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director  or principal shareholder 
in addition  the agencies adopted regulations that authorize  but do not require  an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan  the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
see prompt corrective action above 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties 
the federal regulatory agencies also proposed guidelines for asset quality and earnings standards 

table of contents interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines in december  the federal banking agencies issued the interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines 
this guidance  which updated guidance originally issued in  sets forth the minimum regulatory standards for appraisals 
it incorporates previous regulatory issuances affecting appraisals  addresses advances in information technology used in collateral evaluation  and clarifies standards for use of analytical methods and technological tools in developing evaluations 
this guidance also requires institutions to utilize strong internal controls to ensure reliable appraisals and evaluations and to monitor and periodically update valuations of collateral for existing real estate loans and transactions 
community reinvestment act under the cra  the bank has an obligation to help meet the credit needs of the entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra requires the appropriate federal regulator  in connection with its examination of an insured institution  to assess the institution record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications  such as applications for a merger or the establishment of a branch 
an unsatisfactory rating may be used as the basis for the denial of an application by the federal banking regulator 
the bank received a satisfactory rating in its most recent cra examination 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates we are subject to the provisions of section a of the federal reserve act 
section a places limits on the amount of a bank s loans or extensions of credit to affiliates  a bank s investment in affiliates  assets a bank may purchase from affiliates  except for real and personal property exempted by the federal reserve  the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates  and a bank s guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate 
the total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount  as to any one affiliate  to of a bank s capital and surplus and  as to all affiliates combined  to of a bank s capital and surplus 
in addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions  each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements 
the bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low quality assets 
we are also subject to the provisions of section b of the federal reserve act which  among other things  prohibit an institution from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
the dodd frank act changed the definition of covered transaction in sections a and b and limitations on asset purchases from insiders 
with respect to the definition of covered transaction  the dodd frank act defines that term to include the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a bank s loan or extension of credit to another person or company 
in addition  a derivative transaction with an affiliate is now deemed to be a covered transaction to the extent that such a transaction causes a bank or its subsidiary to have a credit exposure to the affiliate 
in addition  the dodd frank act provides that the bank may not purchase an asset from  or sell an asset to a bank insider or their related interests unless the transaction is conducted on market terms  and if the proposed transaction represents more than of the capital stock and surplus of the bank  it has been approved in advance by a majority of the bank s non interested directors 
the bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers  directors  principal stockholders and their related interests 
these extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 

table of contents incentive compensation the federal reserve  the occ and the fdic have issued regulatory guidance the incentive compensation guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
the federal reserve reviews  as part of the regular  risk focused examination process  the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations  such as the company  that are not large  complex banking organizations 
the findings are included in reports of examination  and deficiencies are incorporated into the organization s supervisory ratings 
enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements  or related risk management control or governance processes  pose a risk to the organization safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies 
the dodd frank act requires the sec and the federal bank regulatory agencies to establish joint regulations or guidelines that require financial institutions with assets of at least billion to disclose the structure of their incentive compensation practices and prohibit such institutions from maintaining compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss to the financial institution 
the sec and the federal bank regulatory agencies proposed such regulations in march  which may become effective before the end of if the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed  they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives 
these proposed regulations incorporate the three principles discussed in the incentive compensation guidance 
usa patriot act of in october  the usa patriot act of the patriot act was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania  and washington  dc that occurred on september  the patriot act impacts financial institutions in particular through its anti money laundering and financial transparency laws 
the patriot act amended the bank secrecy act and the rules and regulations of the office of foreign assets control to establish regulations which  among others  set standards for identifying customers who open an account and promoting cooperation with law enforcement agencies and regulators in order to effectively identify parties that may be associated with  or involved in  terrorist activities or money laundering 
privacy financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information 
customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except for third parties that market the institutions own products and services 
additionally  financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers 
the bank has established policies and procedures designed to safeguard its customers personal financial information and to ensure compliance with applicable privacy laws 
consumer protection the dodd frank act created the cfpb  a federal regulatory agency that is responsible for implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than billion of assets and  to a lesser extent  smaller institutions 
the dodd frank act gives the cfpb authority to supervise and regulate providers of consumer financial products and services  and establishes the cfpb s power to act against unfair  deceptive or abusive practices  and gives the cfpb rulemaking authority in connection with numerous federal consumer financial protection laws for example  but not limited to  the truth in lending act and the real estate settlement procedures act 
as a smaller institution ie  with assets of billion or less  most consumer protection aspects of the dodd frank act will continue to be applied to the company by the federal reserve and to the bank by the occ 
however  the cfpb may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by a smaller institution s prudential regulators and may require smaller institutions to comply with certain cfpb reporting requirements 
in addition  regulatory positions taken by the cfpb and administrative and legal precedents established by cfpb enforcement activities  including in connection with supervision of larger bank holding companies and financial holding companies  could influence how the federal reserve and occ apply consumer protection laws and regulations to financial institutions that are not directly supervised by the cfpb 
the precise impact of the cfpb s consumer protection activities cannot be forecast 
stress testing as required by the dodd frank act  the federal banking agencies have implemented stress testing requirements for certain financial institutions  including bank holding companies  financial holding companies and state chartered banks  with more than billion in total consolidated assets 
although these requirements do not apply to institutions with less than billion in total consolidated assets  the federal banking agencies emphasize that all banking organizations  regardless of size  should have the capacity to analyze the potential impact of adverse market conditions or outcomes on the organization s financial condition 
based on existing regulatory guidance  the company and the bank will be expected to consider the institution s interest rate risk management  commercial real estate concentrations and other credit related information  and funding and liquidity management during this analysis of adverse outcomes 

table of contents other regulations interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the bank are subject to federal laws concerning interest rates 
the bank s loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions  such as the federal truth in lending act  governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers  home mortgage disclosure act of  requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves  equal credit opportunity act  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race  creed  or other prohibited factors in extending credit  fair credit reporting act of  governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies  and rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws 
the deposit operations of the bank are subject to the following the right to financial privacy act  which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records  the electronic funds transfer act and regulation e issued by the federal reserve to implement that act  which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services  and the truth in savings act  which requires disclosure of yields and costs of deposits and deposit accounts 
effect of governmental monetary policies our earnings are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies  as well as general domestic economic conditions 
the federal reserve s power to implement national monetary policy has had  and is likely to continue to have  an important impact on the operating results of financial institutions 
the federal reserve affects the levels of bank loans  investments  and deposits through its control over the issuance of us government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits 
it is not possible to predict the nature  timing or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies 
item a risk factors an investment in our stock involves a number of risks 
investors should carefully consider the following risks as well as the other information in this report and the documents incorporated by reference before making an investment decision 
the realization of any of the risks described below could have a material adverse effect on the company and the price of our common stock 
risks relating to our business the current economic environment continues to pose significant challenges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there was significant disruption and volatility in the financial and capital markets during the past few years 
the financial markets and the financial services industry in particular suffered unprecedented disruption  causing a number of institutions to fail or require government intervention to avoid failure 
these conditions were largely the result of the erosion of the us and global credit markets  including a significant and rapid deterioration in mortgage lending and related real estate markets 
continued declines in real estate values  high unemployment and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents as a consequence of the difficult economic environment  we experienced a significant decrease in earnings resulting primarily from increased provisions for loan losses and a decrease in our interest margin 
while there have been some improvements in the national economy  there can be no assurance that the economic conditions that have adversely affected the financial services industry  and the capital  credit and real estate markets generally  will continue to improve or increase the rate at which it improves  in which case we could continue to experience write downs of assets  and could face capital and liquidity constraints or other business challenges 
a further deterioration in economic conditions  particularly within our market areas  could result in the following consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations loan delinquencies may further increase causing additional increases in our provision and allowance for loan losses 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future charge offs 
collateral for loans made by the bank  especially real estate  may continue to decline in value  in turn reducing a customer s borrowing power  and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans 
consumer confidence levels may decline and cause adverse changes in payment patterns  resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities and decreased demand for our products and services 
our market areas are heavily dependent on  and we have significant credit exposure to  the oil and gas industry 
the economy in a large portion of our market areas is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry 
many of our customers provide transportation and other services and products that support oil and gas exploration and production activities 
as of december   we had approximately million in loans to borrowers in the oil and gas industry  representing approximately of our total loans outstanding as of that date 
the oil and gas industry  especially in louisiana and texas  has been subject to significant volatility  including the oil bust of the s that severely impacted the economies of many of our market areas 
president obama s administration proposed a number of legislative changes that could significantly impact the oil and gas industry  including the elimination of certain tax breaks  such as the intangible drilling and development costs  percentage depletion and manufacturing deduction  and the implementation of an excise tax focused specifically on production in the gulf of mexico 
if there is a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry  generally the cash flows of our customers in this industry would be adversely impacted which could impair their ability to service our loans outstanding to them and or reduce demand for loans 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may suffer losses in our loan portfolio in excess of our allowance for loan losses 
we have experienced increases in the levels of our non performing assets and loan charge offs in recent periods 
our total non performing assets amounted to million  or of our total assets  at december  and we had million of net loan charge offs and a million provision for loan losses for the year ended december  at december   the ratios of our alll to non performing loans and to total loans outstanding were and  respectively 
additional increases in our non performing assets or loan charge offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices 
these practices include analysis of a borrower s prior credit history  financial statements  tax returns and cash flow projections  valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers and verification of liquid assets 
although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make  we still may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria  and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our alll 
we create an alll in our accounting records  based on  among other considerations  the following 
table of contents industry historical losses as reported by the fdic  historical experience with our loans  evaluation of economic conditions  regular reviews of the quality mix  including our distribution of loans by risk grade within our portfolio  and size of our overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
although we maintain an alll at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including conditions which are beyond our control such as a sharp decline in real estate values and changes in interest rates  may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates 
additions to the alll could result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could hinder our ability to grow 
further  if our actual loan losses exceed the amount reserved  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict the effect of recent or future legislative and regulatory initiatives 
financial institutions have been the subject of substantial legislative and regulatory changes and may be the subject of further legislation or regulation in the future  including i changes in banking  securities and tax laws and regulations and their application by our regulators  including pursuant to the dodd frank act  as discussed above in item under the heading business supervision and regulation  and ii changes in the scope and cost of fdic insurance and other coverage  none of which is within our control 
significant new laws or regulations or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws or regulations may cause our results of operations to differ materially from those we currently anticipate 
in addition  the cost and burden of compliance with applicable laws and regulations have significantly increased and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
further  federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for us  as well as for our borrowers  particularly as implemented by the federal reserve board  primarily through open market operations in us government securities  the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements 
a material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on us or our borrowers  and therefore on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect to continue to face increased regulation and supervision of our industry as a result of the continuing economic instability  and there may be additional requirements and conditions imposed on us as a result of our participation in the small business lending fund 
such additional regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the effects of such recently enacted  and proposed  legislation and regulatory programs on us cannot reliably be determined at this time 
the cfpb may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair  deceptive and abusive business practices  which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services  including the bank 
the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the dodd frank act with respect to financial institutions that offer to consumers covered financial products and services 
the cfpb has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair  deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service  or the offering of a consumer financial product or service 
the concept of what may be considered to be an abusive practice is new under the law 
while the bank will not be supervised by the cfpb  it will still be subject to the regulations and policies promulgated by the cfpb and may be examined by the occ for compliance therewith 
the costs and limitations related to complying with any new regulations established by the cfpb have yet to be fully determined and could be material 
further  the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the bank with respect to its consumer product offering and services may also produce significant  material effects on the bank s and our profitability 
we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers 
given the size of these loan relationships relative to capital levels and earnings  a significant loss on any one of these loans could materially and adversely affect us 
we have a concentration of exposure to a number of individual borrowers 
our largest exposure to one borrowing relationship as of december   was approximately million  which is of our total capital 
in addition  as of december   the aggregate exposure to the ten largest borrowing relationships was approximately million  which was of loans and of total capital 
as a result of this concentration  a change in the financial condition of one or more of these borrowers could result in significant loan losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents a large percentage of our deposits are attributable to a relatively small number of customers 
the loss of all or some of these customers or a significant decline in their deposit balances may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
our largest depositors accounted for approximately of our total deposits and our five largest depositors accounted for approximately of our total deposits as of december  the ability to attract these types of deposits has a positive effect on our net interest margin as they provide a relatively low cost of funds to the bank 
while we believe we have strong  long term relationships with each of these customers  the loss of one or more of our largest deposit customers  or a significant decline in the deposit balances would adversely affect our liquidity and require us to attract new deposits  purchase federal funds or borrow funds on a short term basis to replace such deposits  possibly at interest rates higher than those currently paid on these deposits 
this could increase our total cost of funds and could result in a decrease in our net interest income and net earnings 
if we were unable to develop alternative funding sources  we may have difficulty funding loans or meeting other deposit withdrawal requirements 
we occasionally purchase non recourse loan participations from other banks based in part on information provided by the selling bank 
from time to time  we purchase loan participations from other banks in the ordinary course of business  usually without recourse to the selling bank 
as of december   we had approximately million in purchased loan participations  or approximately of our total loan portfolio 
when we purchase loan participations  we apply the same underwriting standards as we would to loans that we directly originate and seek to purchase only loans that would satisfy these standards 
however  we are not as familiar with the borrower and may rely on information provided to us by the selling bank and typically must rely on the selling bank s administration of the loan relationship 
we therefore have less control over  and may incur more risk with respect to  loan participations that we purchase from selling banks as compared to loans that we originate 
our focus on lending to small to mid sized community based businesses may increase our credit risk 
most of our commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions 
if general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate negatively impact this important customer sector  our results of operations and financial condition and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected 
moreover  a portion of these loans have been made by us in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle 
furthermore  the deterioration of our borrowers businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with us  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our loan portfolio includes a substantial percentage of commercial and industrial loans  which may be subject to greater risks than those related to residential loans 
our loan portfolio includes a substantial percentage of commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and historically have involved a greater degree of financial and credit risks than residential first mortgage loans 
repayment of our commercial and industrial loans is often dependent on cash flow of the borrower  which may be unpredictable  and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value 
our commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
most often  this collateral is accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  or real estate 
in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
at december   commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately of our total loan portfolio 
adverse changes in local economic conditions impacting our business borrowers could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate  and the current downturn in the real estate market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
at december   approximately of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral 
the collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment if the borrower defaults and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate in our primary markets could significantly impair the value of real estate collateral and the ability to sell real estate collateral upon foreclosure 
furthermore  it is likely that we would be required to increase the provision for loan losses 
a related risk in connection with loans secured by real estate is the effect of unknown or unexpected environmental contamination  which could make the real estate effectively unmarketable or otherwise significantly reduce its value as collateral 
if we were required to liquidate real estate collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase the allowance for loan losses  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the integration of the recently acquired peoples state bank presents significant challenges that may result in a decline in the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition 
on december   we completed our acquisition of psb financial corporation  the holding company of peoples state bank 
the acquisition involved the combination of two institutions that previously operated independently  which process remains ongoing 
the difficulties of combining peoples state bank s operations with ours include preserving important customer relationships in the north louisiana market where we have not previously operated  costs and customer disruptions that may occur in converting the peoples state bank data processing system to ours  combining the best practices of two institutions  the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  systems and facilities  and reducing the costs associated with each institutions operations 
the process of combining the two bank s operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  our business and the possible loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the recently completed acquisition and the integration of the two bank s operations could have an adverse effect on the business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects of the combined bank 
we may face risks with respect to future expansion and acquisition opportunities 
we have expanded our business in part through acquisitions and will continue to look at future acquisitions as a way to further increase our growth 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing any future acquisitions 
further  failure to realize the potential expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
we cannot say with any certainty that we will be able to consummate  or if consummated  successfully integrate future acquisitions or that we will not incur disruptions or unexpected expenses in integrating such acquisitions 
in attempting to make such acquisitions  we anticipate competing with other financial institutions  many of which have greater financial and operational resources 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  expansion into new markets that may have different characteristics than our current markets and may otherwise present management challenges  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  
table of contents potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target institution  difficulty in estimating the value of the target company  and potential changes in banking  accounting or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target institution 
if we acquire the assets and liabilities of one or more target banks that are in receivership through the fdic bid process for failed institutions  such an acquisition will require us  through our bank subsidiary  to enter into a purchase and assumption agreement the p a agreement with the fdic 
the p a agreement is a form document prepared by the fdic  and our ability to negotiate the terms of this agreement is limited 
as a result  we expect that any p a agreement would provide for limited disclosure about  and limited indemnification for  risks associated with the target bank 
there is a risk that such disclosure regarding  and indemnification for  the assets and liabilities of target banks will not be sufficient and we will incur unanticipated losses 
there is also a risk that we may be required to make an additional payment to the fdic under certain circumstances following the completion of an fdic assisted acquisition if  for example  actual losses related to the target bank s assets acquired are substantially less than expected at the time the p a agreement was entered into 
in addition  the fdic bid process for failed depository institutions is competitive 
we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in bidding for any target bank or for other failed depository institutions 
we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities 
a significant portion of the bank s loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  the bank may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the bank s ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our future earnings could be adversely affected by non cash charges for goodwill impairment  if a future test of goodwill indicates that goodwill has been impaired 
as prescribed by accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements 
we conduct an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment 
after our most recent annual review in the fourth quarter of  we concluded there was no goodwill impairment as of such date 
as of december   we had million in goodwill  including million of goodwill that was recorded in as a result of the psb acquisition 
future goodwill impairment tests may result in future non cash charges  which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period 
changes in the fair value of our securities may reduce our stockholders equity and net income 
at december   million of our securities at fair value were classified as available for sale 
at such date  the aggregate net unrealized gain on our available for sale securities was million 
we increase or decrease stockholders equity by the amount of change from the unrealized gain or loss the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost of our available for sale securities portfolio  net of the related tax  under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
therefore  a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported stockholders equity  as well as book value per common share and tangible book value per common share 
this decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold 
in the case of debt securities  if these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments  the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities 
in the case of equity securities which have no stated maturity  the declines in fair value may or may not be recovered over time 

table of contents we monitor the fair value of our entire securities portfolio as part of our ongoing other than temporary impairment otti evaluation process 
no assurance can be given that we will not need to recognize otti charges related to securities in the future 
in addition  as a condition to membership in the federal home loan bank of dallas fhlb dallas  we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of fhlb dallas stock 
our stock purchase requirement is based  in part  upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the fhlb dallas 
at december   we had stock in the fhlb dallas totaling approximately  the fhlb dallas stock held by us is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards 
for the year ended december   we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our fhlb dallas stock holdings 
there can be no assurance  however  that future negative changes to the financial condition of the fhlb dallas may not require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such holdings 
loss of key officers or employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers 
as a community bank  our business is primarily relationship driven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships 
in addition  our success has been and will continue to be greatly influenced by the ability to retain existing senior management and  with expansion  to attract and retain qualified additional senior and middle management 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers 
loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor 
while we believe our relationship with our key personnel is good  we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization 
loss of such key personnel  should they enter into an employment relationship with one of our competitors  could result in the loss of some of our customers 
a natural disaster  especially one affecting one of our market areas  could adversely affect us 
since most of our business is conducted in louisiana and texas  most of our credit exposure is in those states 
historically  louisiana and texas have been vulnerable to natural disasters 
therefore  we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters  such as hurricanes  floods and tornadoes 
natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications  including the interruption or loss of our websites  which would prevent us from gathering deposits  originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business  as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational  financial and management information systems 
a natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets  our loan portfolio  as uninsured or underinsured losses  including losses from business disruption  may reduce borrowers ability to repay their loans 
disasters may also reduce the value of the real estate securing our loans  impairing our ability to recover on defaulted loans through foreclosure and making it more likely that we would suffer losses on defaulted loans 
although we have implemented several back up systems and protections and maintain business interruption insurance  these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster 
the occurrence of natural disasters in our market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability is vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on net interest income  which is the difference between our interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income 
for example  as securities in our investment portfolio have matured  they have been replaced by securities paying a lower yield 
we expect this trend to continue during these changes in our investment portfolio have negatively impacted  and are expected to continue to negatively impact  our net interest margin 
furthermore  some of our variable interest rate loans have minimum fixed interest rates floors that are currently above the contractual variable interest rate 
if interest rates rise  the interest income from our variable interest rate loans with floors may not increase as quickly as interest expense on our liabilities  which would negatively impact our net interest income 
in periods of increasing interest rates  loan originations may decline  depending on the performance of the overall economy  which may adversely affect income from lending activities 
also  increases in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of fixed income assets 
in addition  an increase in the general level of interest rates may affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest and principal on their obligations 

table of contents non performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets adversely affect our net earnings in various ways 
until economic and market conditions improve  we expect to incur provisions for loan losses relating to an increase in non performing assets 
we generally do not record interest income on non performing loans or other real estate owned  thereby adversely affecting our earnings  and increasing our loan administration costs 
when we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings  we mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs  which may result in a loss 
an increase in the level of non performing assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile 
while we reduce problem assets through loan sales  workouts  restructurings and otherwise  decreases in the value of the underlying collateral  or in these borrowers performance or financial condition  whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control  could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the resolution of non performing assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors  which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in non performing assets 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate within a highly regulated environment and our business and results are affected by the regulations to which we are subject 
we operate within a highly regulated environment 
the regulations to which we are subject will continue to have an impact on our operations and the degree to which we can grow and be profitable 
certain regulators  to which we are subject  have significant power in reviewing our operations and approving our business practices 
in recent years the bank  as well as other financial institutions  has experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny  often requiring additional resources 
in addition  investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies may result in judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  or other results adverse to us 
there is no assurance that any change to the regulatory requirements to which we are subject  or the way in which such regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced  will not have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations 
we rely heavily on technology and computer systems 
the negative effects of computer system failures and unethical individuals with the technological ability to cause disruption of service could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits 
our ability to compete depends on our ability to continue to adapt and deliver technology on a timely and cost effective basis to meet customers demands for financial services 
we provide our customers the ability to bank online and many customers now remotely submit deposits to us through remote capture systems 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is a critical element of these services 
our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses  phishing schemes and other security problems 
we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses  or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses 
to the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information  security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims  litigation and other possible liabilities 
any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts  mutual funds or general purpose reloadable prepaid cards 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents risks relating to an investment in our common stock share ownership may be diluted by the issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future 
our stock incentive plan provides for the granting of stock incentives to directors  officers  and employees 
as of december   there were  shares issued under options and  shares in restricted stock granted under that plan 
likewise  approximately  shares  including shares issuable under currently outstanding options  may be issued in the future to directors  officers  and employees under our existing equity incentive plans 
in addition  in  as part of our participation in the treasury s capital purchase program cpp  we also issued a stock purchase warrant that currently entitles the holder to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
it is probable that options and or warrants will be exercised during their respective terms if the stock price exceeds the exercise price of the particular option or warrant 
the incentive plan also provides that all issued options automatically and fully vest upon a change in control 
if the options are exercised  share ownership will be diluted 
additionally  share ownership of our common stock will be diluted from shares issued upon conversion of the convertible preferred equity issued in the psb acquisition 
the company may redeem the series c preferred stock  subject to regulatory approval  beginning on or after the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the merger  at a redemption price equal to the liquidation value of the series c preferred stock  plus declared but unpaid dividends  if any 
the company may also redeem the series c preferred stock  subject to regulatory approval  at the same redemption price prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing date in the event the series c preferred stock no longer qualifies for tier capital treatment by the applicable federal banking regulators 
holders may convert the series c preferred stock at any time into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to customary antidilution adjustments 
in addition  on or after the fifth anniversary of the closing date  the company will have the option to require conversion of the series c preferred stock if the closing price of the company s common stock for trading days within any period of consecutive trading days  exceeds of the conversion price 
in addition  our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  but do not provide for preemptive rights to the stockholders  therefore  stockholders will not automatically have the right to subscribe for additional shares 
as a result  if we issue additional shares to raise additional capital or for other corporate purposes  you may be unable to maintain your pro rata ownership in the company 
the holders of our preferred stock and trust preferred securities have rights that are senior to those of stockholders and that may impact our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and net income available to our common stockholders 
at december   we had outstanding million of trust preferred securities 
these securities are senior to shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on our trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock  moreover  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution  or liquidation  the obligations outstanding with respect to our trust preferred securities must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our stockholders 
while we have the right to defer dividends on the trust preferred securities for a period of up to five years  if any such election is made  no dividends may be paid to our common or preferred stockholders during that time 
in addition  with respect to the million in series b preferred stock outstanding that was issued to the treasury in the sblf transaction  we are required to pay cumulative dividends on the series b preferred stock at an annual rate between and depending on our volume of qualified small business loans 
the million in series c preferred stock outstanding that was issued in connection with the psb acquisition  calls for the non cumulative payment of dividends at an annual rate of 
dividends paid on our series b preferred stock or series c preferred stock will also reduce the net income available to our common stockholders and our earnings per common share 
we may not declare or pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock without first having paid all accrued preferred dividends that are due 

table of contents only a limited trading market exists for our common stock  which could lead to price volatility 
our common stock is listed for trading on the nyse mkt equities under the trading symbol msl  but there is low trading volume in our common stock 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which might occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 
future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales may occur  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
in addition  even if a more active market in our common stock develops  we cannot assure you that such a market will continue 
our directors and executive management own a significant number of shares of stock  allowing further control over business and corporate affairs 
our directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately million shares  or  of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  in addition to their day to day management roles  they will be able to exercise significant influence on our business as stockholders  including influence over election of the board and the authorization of other corporate actions requiring shareholder approval 
in deciding on how to vote on certain proposals  our stockholders should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests that are different from  or in addition to  the interests of our stockholders generally 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws  louisiana law  and state and federal banking regulations  could delay or prevent a takeover by a third party 
our articles of incorporation and by laws could delay  defer  or prevent a third party takeover  despite possible benefit to the stockholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our governing documents permit directors to be removed by stockholders only for cause and only upon an vote  require of the voting power for stockholders to amend the by laws  call a special meeting  or amend the articles of incorporation  in each case if the proposed action was not approved by the board  authorize a class of preferred stock that may be issued in series with terms  including voting rights  established by the board without stockholder approval  authorize approximately million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock that may be issued by the board without shareholder approval  classify our board with staggered three year terms  preventing a change in a majority of the board at any annual meeting  require advance notice of proposed nominations for election to the board and business to be conducted at a shareholder meeting  and require of the voting power for stockholders to approve business combinations not approved by the board 
these provisions would likely preclude a third party from removing incumbent directors and simultaneously gaining control of the board by filling the vacancies thus created with its own nominees 
under the classified board provisions  it would take at least two elections of directors for any individual or group to gain control of the board 
accordingly  these provisions could discourage a third party from initiating a proxy contest  making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to gain control 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying consideration of a shareholder proposal until the next annual meeting unless a special meeting is called by the board or the chairman of the board 
moreover  even in the absence of an attempted takeover  the provisions make it difficult for stockholders dissatisfied with the board to effect a change in the board s composition  even at annual meetings 
also  we are subject to the provisions of the louisiana business corporation law lbcl  which provides that we may not engage in certain business combinations with an interested shareholder generally defined as the holder of or more of the voting shares unless the transaction was approved by the board before the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder or the transaction was approved by at least two thirds of the outstanding voting shares not beneficially owned by the interested shareholder and of the total voting power or certain conditions relating to the price to be paid to the stockholders are met 

table of contents the lbcl also addresses certain transactions involving control shares  which are shares that would have voting power with respect to the company within certain ranges of voting power 
control shares acquired in a control share acquisition have voting rights only to the extent granted by a resolution approved by our stockholders 
if control shares are accorded full voting rights and the acquiring person has acquired control shares with a majority or more of all voting power  stockholders of the issuing public corporation have dissenters rights as provided by the lbcl 
our future ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock is subject to restrictions 
since we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the bank  we have no material source of income other than dividends received from the bank 
therefore  our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders will depend on the bank s ability to pay dividends to us 
moreover  banks and financial holding companies are both subject to certain federal and state regulatory restrictions on cash dividends 
we are also restricted from paying dividends if we have deferred payments of the interest on  or an event of default has occurred with respect to  our trust preferred securities  series b preferred stock or series c preferred stock 
additionally  terms and conditions of our outstanding shares of preferred stock place certain restrictions and limitations on our common stock dividends and repurchases of our common stock 
a shareholder s investment is not an insured deposit 
an investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the fdic or any other government agency

cash dividends totaling million were declared to common stockholders during a quarterly dividend of per share was paid for each quarter of  for a total of per share for the year 
under the louisiana law  we may not pay a dividend if i we are insolvent or would thereby be made insolvent  or ii the declaration or payment thereof would be contrary to any restrictions contained in our articles of incorporation 
our primary source of funds for dividends is the dividends we receive from the bank  therefore  our ability to declare dividends is highly dependent upon future earnings  financial condition  and results of operation of the bank as well as applicable legal restrictions on the bank s ability to pay dividends and other relevant factors 
the bank currently has the ability to declare dividends to us without prior approval of our primary regulators 
however  the bank s ability to pay dividends to us will be prohibited if the result would cause the bank s regulatory capital to fall below minimum requirements 
additionally  dividends to us cannot exceed a total of the bank s current year and prior two years earnings  net of dividends paid to us in those years 
pursuant to the terms of our series b preferred stock  series c preferred stock  and the terms of our trust preferred securities  we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock during any period in which we have deferred interest payments on either the series b preferred stock  series c preferred stock or the trust preferred securities

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to highlight changes in the financial condition of the company and on its results of operations during  and this discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement information presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item overview we are a financial holding company  headquartered in lafayette  louisiana  that through our community banking subsidiary  midsouth bank  na  operates offices in louisiana and texas 
we had approximately billion in consolidated assets as of december  we derive the majority of our income from interest received on our loans and investments 
our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
approximately of our total deposits are interest bearing 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the resulting ratio of that difference as a percentage of our average earning assets represents our net interest margin 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  which is called our net interest spread 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period 
we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses 
our financial performance for the years ended december  and were  and continue to be  significantly impacted by the disruptions in the national economy and the resulting financial uncertainty that has severely impacted the banking industry 
while we believe our market areas have fared better than the national economy during this most recent economic downturn  the economic uncertainty and difficult real estate markets had an impact on our loan losses  loan demand and our net interest margin 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers 
we have also included a discussion of the various components of this noninterest income  as well as of our noninterest expense 
we plan to continue to grow both organically and through acquisitions  including potential expansion into new market areas 
we believe our current financial condition  coupled with our scalable operational capabilities will allow us to act upon growth opportunities in the current banking environment 
the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the financial statements accompanying or incorporated by reference in this report 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other statistical information included and incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
acquisition activity during and on december   we completed a merger with psb financial corporation psb  the holding company of many  louisiana based the peoples state bank 
this transaction continued our strategic growth and enhanced the connection between louisiana and texas by expanding midsouth bank s presence into central and northeast louisiana and east texas 
under the terms of the definitive agreement  we issued  shares of the company s common stock valued at million  million in preferred equity through a newly created series c noncumulative convertible preferred stock  and million in cash 
in addition  the merger agreement provided for potential additional cash consideration of up to million  plus interest  based on the resolution of certain identified loans over a three year period 
we acquired approximately million in assets at fair value from psb and added banking centers with approximately million in loans and approximately million in deposits 
we also assumed approximately million in junior subordinated debentures issued by psb in connection with its trust preferred securities 
the systems conversion for psb will be completed in march additional information regarding the psb merger is included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the bank completed three acquisitions in on july   the bank acquired five jefferson bank branches in the dallas fort worth market from first bank and trust company of lubbock  texas 
in connection with this acquisition  the bank acquired million of loans and assumed million in deposits from jefferson bank 
in connection with the acquisition  the bank also purchased million of loan participations from first bank and trust 
on december   the bank acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of first louisiana national bank flnb  breaux bridge  louisiana 
in connection with this acquisition  the bank acquired million in loans and assumed million in deposits from flnb 
on december   the bank acquired the tyler  texas branch of beacon federal 
in connection with this acquisition  the bank acquired million in loans and assumed million in deposits from beacon federal 
the system conversions for all three acquisitions were completed in the third and fourth quarters of critical accounting policies certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the accounting principles we follow and the methods of applying these principles conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and general banking practices 
our most critical accounting policy relates to the determination of the allowance for loan losses  which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of its borrowers to make loan payments 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance involves significant judgment and complexity and is based on many factors 
if the financial condition of our borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required 
see asset quality allowance for loan losses and note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
another of our critical accounting policies relates to the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and other purchase accounting adjustments 
we account for acquisitions in accordance with asc topic no 
 which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting 
under this method  we are required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value  including intangible assets 
determination of fair value involves estimates based on internal valuations of discounted cash flow analyses performed  third party valuations  or other valuation techniques that involve subjective assumptions 
additionally  the term of the useful lives and appropriate amortization periods of intangible assets is subjective 
resulting goodwill from an acquisition under the purchase method of accounting represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if deemed necessary 
if the fair value of an asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset  no charge to goodwill is made 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset  goodwill will be adjusted through a charge to earnings 
in evaluating the goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet for impairment at december   we first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our acquired assets is less than the carrying amount of the acquired assets  as allowed under asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
after making the assessment based on several factors  which included but was not limited to the current economic environment  the economic outlook in our markets  our financial performance and common stock value as compared to our peers  we determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our acquired assets is greater than the carrying amount and  accordingly  no impairment of goodwill was recorded for the year ended december  given the instability of the economic environment  it is reasonably possible that the methodology of the assessment of potential loan losses and goodwill impairment could change in the near term or could result in impairment going forward 

table of contents another of our critical accounting policies relates to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we record deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards  are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
in the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities results in deferred tax assets  an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such assets is required 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a portion or the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the ability to realize the deferred tax assets  management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
a deferred tax liability is not recognized for portions of the allowance for loan losses for income tax purposes in excess of the financial statement balance 
such a deferred tax liability will only be recognized when it becomes apparent that those temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent more likely of being realized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
results of operations net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december   or an increase of million 
diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december   compared to for merger related expenses totaled million for versus million for with the closing of the psb merger on december  and no material changes in the balance sheet or operating results of psb between december  and december   net earnings for included no operating results for psb 
in year over year comparison  net income available to common stockholders increased primarily as a result of a million improvement in net interest income combined with a million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a million improvement in non interest income 
of the million increase in net interest income  a total of million was earned from the branches acquired in the third and fourth quarters of purchase accounting adjustments totaling million also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
interest income on investments and other interest bearing accounts increased million in prior year comparison and included interest earned on excess cash invested from the acquisitions 
increases in noninterest income consisted primarily of  in service charges on deposit accounts   in atm and debit card income   in mortgage banking fees  and a  net gain on sale of securities 
the improvement in revenues offset a million increase in noninterest expense and a million increase in income tax expense 
the increase in non interest expense resulted primarily from a million increase in salary and benefits costs  million in occupancy expense  and  in atm debit card processing expense 
total consolidated assets increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  the increase in assets resulted from the million in assets acquired as a result of the psb merger 
total loans were billion at december   an increase of million  or  from the million reported as of december  the million growth in loans included million acquired from psb and million in organic growth 
deposits totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december  and included million in deposits acquired from psb 
the addition of million in transaction deposits from psb reinforced our strong relationship based deposit mix 
our noninterest bearing deposit base represented of total deposits at december  our tier leverage capital ratio increased to at december  compared to at december  tier risk weighted capital and total risk weighted capital ratios were and at december   compared to and at december   respectively 
the tier common equity ratio at december  was

our return on average common equity and average assets ratios for the years ended december  and were significantly impacted by merger and acquisition expenses 

table of contents nonperforming assets totaled million at december   an increase of million over the million reported for year end the increase resulted primarily from the addition of million in nonperforming assets acquired from psb  which included million in nonaccrual loans  million in loans past due days and over and accruing and million in other real estate owned ore 
the addition of psb nonperforming loans reduced the allowance coverage for nonperforming loans to at december  from at december  and decreased the all total loans ratio to from 
loans classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs totaled million at december  compared to  at december  a total of million in tdrs acquired with psb included four credits  two of which are large commercial credits 
table summary of return on equity and assets return on average assets return on average common equity dividend payout ratio on common stock average equity to average assets note and return on average assets and return on average common equity were impacted by approximately million of merger costs and million of acquisition and related system conversion charges due to the psb merger and the branch acquisitions  respectively 
excluding these merger costs  return on average assets for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december   and return on average common equity for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  earnings analysis net interest income our primary source of earnings is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities combined with changes in market rates of interest greatly affect net interest income 
our net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis  which is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets  was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively

net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis increased million for over  the result of a million increase in fte interest income and a million decrease in interest expense 
the increase in interest income on earning assets resulted primarily from a million increase in the volume of average earnings assets primarily as a result of the three acquisitions in the improvement in interest income from the increased average volume of earning assets was partially offset by a basis point decline in the average yield on loans  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  loan yields declined as matured loans re priced in the lower rate environment and new loan rates reflected competitive market pricing 
additionally  interest income on investment securities for increased as a million increase in the average volume of investment securities offset the impact of a basis point reduction in the average fte yield earned on investment securities 
the reduction in the fte average yield on investment securities from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  resulted from lower yields on investments purchased in with excess cash flow from the acquisitions and from maturing securities within the portfolio 
interest expense increased minimally in year over year comparison as the impact of a million increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities was mostly offset by a basis point reduction in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as a result  the fte net interest margin declined basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  net of purchase accounting adjustments  the fte net interest margin declined basis points for over  from to for the years ended december  and  respectively

income from service charges and fees on deposit accounts  including insufficient funds fees nsf fees  increased million in compared to a million decrease in the increase in was primarily due to a higher volume of transaction accounts as a result of the acquisitions 
the decrease in was primarily due to a million reduction of nsf fee income  which resulted from fewer nsf items processed 
we believe this was primarily driven by the changes implemented in our policies in connection with the changes in regulation e in income on atm and debit card transactions increased  in and  in as the result of an increase in electronic transactions processed 
other noninterest income increased  in and increased  in  including net gains on sales of securities

atm and debit card processing fees increased  in and decreased  in the increase in resulted primarily from an increased volume of electronic transactions processed 
additionally  losses on electronic transactions increased  from  in to  in the decrease in is primarily due to a decrease in the cost of third party processing 

table of contents data processing costs  included in other non interest expense  decreased  in and increased million in primarily due to data processing charges of million incurred as a result of three computer processing system conversions associated with the acquisitions

these decreases were mostly offset by increases of  in the cost of printing and supplies   in armored car and courier expenses   in telephone expense  and  in corporate development and training costs  which are reflective of the expansion of our franchise 
in  other non interest expense was also impacted by a  increase in expenses on other real estate owned due primarily to the repossession of a condominium complex in the second quarter of the increase was partially offset by a  decrease in fdic fees due to a change in the assessment calculation

psb s loan mix consisted of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  residential real estate loans  consumer installment loans  and construction loans 
the organic loan growth in resulted from improved loan demand and funding activity primarily in the second and third quarters of organic growth has continued to be affected by commercial and consumer customers continuing to pay down debt in an unstable economic environment 
our loan portfolio is diversified throughout our louisiana and texas markets  with a focus on commercial  financial  agricultural c i and owner occupied commercial real estate cre loans 
our c i and cre loans are primarily underwritten on cash flow analyses versus collateral valuations 
the c i portfolio consists primarily of term loans or revolving lines of credit which are generally structured with annual maturity 
the term loans are generally structured with fixed rates and three to five year maturities 
the cre portfolio consists primarily of credits that have fifteen to twenty year amortization terms with rates fixed primarily for three years  but up to five years 
we believe the shorter term structure of our c i and cre credits allows greater flexibility in controlling interest rate risk 
the loan portfolio at december  consisted of approximately in fixed rate loans  with the majority maturing within five years 
approximately of the portfolio earns a variable rate of interest  the greater majority of which adjusts simultaneous with changes in the prime rate and a smaller portion that adjusts on a scheduled repricing date 
the mix of variable and fixed rate loans provides some protection from changes in market rates of interest 
additionally  over the past two years  we established rate floors  primarily for our commercial loans  that provided some protection to our net interest margin during a sustained low rate environment like we are currently facing

our chief credit officer cco is responsible for credit underwriting and loan operations for the bank 
the role of cco includes on going review and development of lending policies  commercial credit analysis  centralized consumer underwriting  loan operations documentation and funding  and overall credit risk management procedures 
the current risk management process requires that each individual loan officer review his or her portfolio on a quarterly basis and assign recommended credit ratings on each loan 
these efforts are supplemented by independent reviews performed by the loan review officer and other validations performed by the internal audit department 
the results of the reviews are reported directly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the conservative nature of our underwriting practices has resulted in strong credit quality in our loan portfolio 
completed loan applications  credit bureau reports  financial statements  and a committee approval process remain a part of credit decisions 
documentation of the loan decision process is required on each credit application  whether approved or denied  to ensure thorough and consistent procedures 
additionally  we have historically recognized and disclosed significant problem loans quickly and taken prompt action to address material weaknesses in those credits 
our loan review process also includes monitoring and reporting of loan concentrations whereby individual customer and aggregate industry leverage  profitability  risk rating distributions  and liquidity are evaluated for each major standard industry classification segment 
at december   one industry segment concentration  the oil and gas industry  aggregated more than of our loan portfolio

consumer and commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest is days past due  or sooner if the full collectability of principal or interest is doubtful  except if the underlying collateral fully supports both the principal and accrued interest and the loan is in the process of collection 
our policy provides that retail consumer loans that become days delinquent be routinely charged off

however  because of the issue date of our debentures and our asset size  we may continue to include the debentures in our tier capital 
in   and  we did not have an average balance in any category of short term borrowings including retail repurchase agreements  reverse repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased  or frb discount window that exceeded of our stockholders equity for such year 
capital as described under business supervision and regulation  we are required to maintain certain minimum capital levels for the company and the bank 
risk based capital requirements are intended to make regulatory capital more sensitive to the risk profile of an institution assets 
at december   the company and the bank were in compliance with statutory minimum capital requirements 
minimum capital requirements include a total risk based capital ratio of  with tier capital not less than  and a leverage ratio tier capital to total average adjusted assets of based upon the regulators latest composite rating of the institution 
as of december   the company s leverage ratio was as compared to at december  tier capital to risk weighted assets was and for and  respectively 
total capital to risk weighted assets was and  respectively  for the same periods 
for regulatory purposes  tier capital includes million of the junior subordinated debentures issued by the company and assumed in the psb acquisition 
for financial reporting purposes  these funds are included as a liability under gaap 
the bank s leverage ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
the fdic improvement act of established a capital based supervisory system for all insured depository institutions that imposes increasing restrictions on the institution as its capital deteriorates 
the bank was classified as well capitalized as of december  no significant restrictions are placed on the bank as a result of this classification 
as discussed under the heading balance sheet analysis securities  million in unrealized gains on securities available for sale  less a deferred tax liability of million  was recorded as an addition to stockholders equity as of december  as of december   million in unrealized gains on securities available for sale  less a deferred tax liability of million  was recorded as an addition to stockholders equity 
while the net unrealized loss or gain on securities available for sale is required to be reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  it does not affect operating results or regulatory capital ratios 
the net unrealized gains and losses reported for december  and  however  did affect the equity to assets ratio for financial reporting purposes 
the ratio of equity to assets was at december  and at december  
table of contents asset liability management and interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity to changes in market rates of interest 
the primary objective of our asset and liability management process is to evaluate interest rate sensitivity inherent in our balance sheet components and establish guidelines to manage that risk within acceptable performance levels 
management and our board of directors are responsible for determining the appropriate level of acceptable risk based on our strategic focus  regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity  and the market environment 
our board of directors established an asset liability management committee alco  comprised of certain executive and senior officers of the bank  to measure and monitor interest rate risk within defined parameters 
during  alco utilized an internal model of asset and liability management to measure interest rate risk using net interest income simulation and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis 
the model captures data from our internal operating systems  an external investment portfolio accounting system and additional information regarding rates and prepayment characteristics to construct an analysis that presents differences in repricing  cash flows and the maturity characteristics of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods 
this data  combined with additional assumptions including repricing rates and payment characteristics  were used to perform instantaneous parallel rate shift and alternate rate shift simulations 
instantaneous parallel rate shifts are known as rate shocks because all rates are modeled to change instantaneously by the indicated shock amount 
alternate rate shifts include floor rates that generally provide more realistic projections of changes in net interest income and market risk 
results of the simulations were compared to a base case scenario that provided projected net interest income over the next months with no change in the balance sheet 
the estimated percentage changes in projected net interest income due to changes in interest rates of alternate down basis points  parallel up  and up basis points as determined through the simulations are detailed below 
at december   the interest rate risk model results were within policy guidelines and indicated that our balance sheet is slightly asset sensitive 
the results of the interest rate risk modeling are reviewed by alco and discussed quarterly at funds management committee meetings of our board of directors 
net interest income at risk in year changes in interest rates estimated increase decrease in nii at december  shock up basis points shock up basis points alternate down basis points in january  we revised our asset liability and funds management policy to allow for the use of interest rate derivatives 
during  we entered into two loan level interest rate swaps with customers that had current notional balances totaling million as of december  these agreements effectively converted both fixed rate loans originated into floating rates that are tied to the one month libor 
concurrently  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a third party brokerage firm that effectively offset the interest rate risk associated with the customers interest rate swaps 
as a result  these swap agreements have no impact on our earnings 

table of contents liquidity bank liquidity liquidity is the availability of funds to meet maturing contractual obligations and to fund operations 
the bank s primary liquidity needs involve its ability to accommodate customers demands for deposit withdrawals as well as customers requests for credit 
liquidity is deemed adequate when sufficient cash to meet these needs can be promptly raised at a reasonable cost to the bank 
liquidity is provided primarily by three sources a stable base of funding sources  an adequate level of assets that can be readily converted into cash  and borrowing lines with correspondent banks 
our core deposits are our most stable and important source of funding 
cash deposits at other banks  federal funds sold  and principal payments received on loans and mortgage backed securities provide additional primary sources of liquidity 
approximately million in projected cash flows from securities repayments during provides an additional source of liquidity 
the bank also has significant borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of atlanta frb and with the fhlb dallas 
as of december   we had no borrowings with the frb atlanta 
we assumed at fair value million in fhlb advances from psb 
the company has million in borrowing capacity at the frb discount window and has the ability to post additional collateral of approximately million if necessary to meet liquidity needs 
additionally  million in loan collateral is pledged under a borrower in custody line with the frb atlanta 
under existing agreements with the fhlb dallas  our borrowing capacity totaled million at december  additional unsecured borrowing lines totaling million are available through correspondent banks 
we utilize these contingency funding alternatives to meet deposit volatility  which is more likely in the current environment  given unusual competitive offerings within our markets 
company liquidity in august  the company repaid million in series a preferred stock issued in to the treasury under the cpp with funds from the treasury s sblf program authorized by congress under the small business jobs act of as a result of the repurchase of the series a preferred stock  all of the tarp limitations affecting the company were removed 
in connection with the sblf transaction  the company issued million in series b preferred stock to the treasury 
net of million used to repay the series a preferred stock  the remaining million was injected into the bank as additional common equity capital 
the dividend rate on the series b preferred stock at march  was per annum 
for future quarters through the ninth calendar quarter  the dividend rate may be adjusted to between per annum and per annum to reflect changes to the bank s level of qualified small business lending or qsbl 
if the level of the bank s qualified small business loans declines so that the percentage increase in qsbl as compared to the baseline level of qsbl is less than  then the dividend rate payable on the series b preferred stock would increase 
for the tenth calendar quarter through four and one half years after issuance  the dividend rate will be fixed at between and based upon the increase in qsbl as of the ninth calendar quarter as compared to the baseline 
after four and one half years from issuance  the dividend rate will increase to per annum 
as of december   the dividend rate was per annum 
at the company level  cash is needed primarily to meet interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures  dividend payments on the series b and series c preferred stock and dividends on the common stock 
we issued  in unsecured junior subordinated debentures in september and  in february in december  we acquired million in unsecured junior subordinated debentures from psb 
the terms of the junior subordinated debentures are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
no dividends were paid by the bank to the company in or  however  as of january   the bank had the ability to pay dividends to the company of approximately million without prior approval from the occ 
at december   the parent company had approximately million cash available for general corporate purposes  including injecting capital into the bank 
as a publicly traded company  the company also has the ability  subject to market conditions  to issue additional shares of common stock  preferred stock and other securities to provide funds as needed for operations and future growth of the company and the bank 
dividends the primary source of cash dividends on the company common stock is dividends from the bank 
the bank has the ability to declare dividends to the company of up to million as of december  without prior approval of the occ 
however  the bank s ability to pay dividends would be prohibited if the result would cause the bank s regulatory capital to fall below minimum requirements 

table of contents cash dividends totaling million and million were declared to common stockholders during and  respectively 
during and through august of  pursuant to the terms of the agreements between us and the treasury governing the cpp transaction  we could not pay cash dividends on our common stock in excess of per share per year 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations in the normal course of business we use various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of customers and to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
we did not have an average balance in any category of short term borrowings detailed below in   or that exceeded of our stockholders equity for such year 
additional information regarding contractual obligations appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents significant contractual obligations as of december  table contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period year more than total or less years years years time deposits federal funds purchased long term debt obligations retail repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements operating lease obligations total impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  presented herein  have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation
