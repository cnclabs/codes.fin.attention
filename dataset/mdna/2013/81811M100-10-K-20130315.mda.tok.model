the thrift industry thrift institutions are financial intermediaries which historically have accepted savings deposits from the general public and  to a lesser extent  borrowed funds from outside sources and invested those deposits and funds primarily in loans secured by first mortgage liens on residential and other types of real estate 
such institutions may also invest their funds in various types of short and long term securities 
the deposits of bank and thrift institutions are insured by the deposit insurance fund dif as administered by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  and these institutions are subject to extensive regulations 
these regulations govern  among other things  the lending and other investment powers of thrift institutions  including the terms of mortgage instruments these institutions are permitted to utilize  the types of deposits they are permitted to accept  and reserve requirements 
the operations of thrift institutions  including those of the bank  are significantly affected by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and regulations and policies of financial institution regulatory authorities  including the federal reserve and the occ into which the former ots was merged 
lending activities are influenced by a number of factors including the demand for housing  conditions in the construction industry  and availability of funds 
sources of funds for lending activities include savings deposits  loan principal payments  proceeds from sales of loans  borrowings from the fhlb atlanta and other sources 
savings flows at thrift institutions such as the bank are influenced by a number of factors including interest rates on competing investments and levels of personal income 
earnings the bank s earnings depend primarily on the difference between income from interest earning assets such as loans and investments  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank typically engages in long term mortgage lending at fixed rates of interest  generally for periods of up to years  while accepting deposits for considerably shorter periods 
however  many of the bank s long term fixed rate loans are sold in the secondary market  typically resulting in net gains on the sale of such loans by the bank 
generally  rapidly rising interest rates cause the cost of interest bearing liabilities to increase more rapidly than yields on interest earning assets  thereby adversely affecting the earnings of many thrift institutions 
while the industry has received expanded lending and borrowing powers in recent years permitting different types of investments and mortgage loans  including those with floating or adjustable rates and those with shorter terms  earnings and operations are still highly influenced by levels of interest rates and financial market conditions and by substantial investments in long term mortgage loans 
competition the annapolis  maryland area has a high density of financial institutions  many of which are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the bank  and all of which are competitors of the bank to varying degrees 
the bank s competition for loans comes primarily from savings and loan associations  savings banks  mortgage banking companies  insurance companies  and commercial banks 
many of the bank s competitors have higher legal lending limits than the bank 
the bank s most direct competition for deposits has historically come from savings and loan associations  savings banks  commercial banks  and credit unions 
the bank faces additional competition for deposits from short term money market funds and other corporate and government securities funds 
the bank also faces increased competition for deposits from other financial institutions such as brokerage firms  insurance companies and mutual funds 
the bank is a community oriented financial institution serving its market area with a wide selection of mortgage loans 
management considers the bank s reputation for financial strength and customer service as its major competitive advantage in attracting and retaining customers in its market area 
the bank also believes it benefits from its community orientation 
net interest income net interest income increases during periods when the spread between bancorp s weighted average rate at which new loans are originated and the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities widens 
market factors such as interest rates  competition  consumer preferences  the supply of and demand for housing  and the availability of funds affect the bank s ability to originate loans 
bancorp has supplemented its interest income through purchases of investments when appropriate 
this activity is intended to generate positive interest rate spreads on large principal balances with minimal administrative expense 
interest rate and volume of interest related assets and liabilities both changes in rate and changes in the composition of bancorp s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can have a significant effect on net interest income 
for information concerning the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities have affected bancorp s interest income and expense during the fiscal years ended december  and  refer to item  selected financial data rate volume table

loans sold in the secondary market are primarily sold to investors with which the bank maintains a correspondent relationship 
these loans are made in conformity with standard underwriting criteria to assure maximum eligibility for possible resale in the secondary market  and are approved either by the bank s underwriter or the correspondent s underwriter 
loans considered for the bank s portfolio are approved by the bank s loan committee  which includes the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief risk officer and the chief credit officer 
meetings of the loan committee are open to attendance by any member of the bank s board of directors who wishes to attend 
the loan committee reports to and consults with the board of directors in interpreting and applying the bank s lending policy 
single loans greater than  or loans to one borrower aggregating more than  up to  the maximum amount of loans to one borrower as of december   must also have board of directors approval 
loans that are sold are typically long term or more years loans with fixed interest rates eligible for resale in the secondary market 
loans retained for bancorp s portfolio typically include construction loans  commercial loans and loans that periodically reprice or mature prior to the end of an amortized term 
loans are sold with either servicing released or retained by the bank 
as of december   the bank was servicing  in loans for federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc   in loans for federal national mortgage association fnma and  in loans for other investors 
the following table contains information  as of december   on the percentage of fixed rate single family loans serviced for others by the bank  by interest rate category 
interest rate range percentage of portfolio less than over the bank s mortgage loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan  the viability of the loan  and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan 
the authority of the loan committee to approve loans is established by the board of directors and currently is commensurate with the bank s limitation on loans to one borrower 
the bank s maximum amount of loans to one borrower currently is equal to of the bank s unimpaired capital  or  as of december  loans greater than this amount require participation by one or more additional lenders 
letters of credit are subject to the same limitations as direct loans 
the bank utilizes independent qualified appraisers approved by the board of directors to appraise the properties securing its loans and requires title insurance or title opinions so as to insure that the bank has a valid lien on the mortgaged real estate 
the bank requires borrowers to maintain fire and casualty insurance on its secured properties 
the procedure for approval of construction loans is the same for residential mortgage loans  except that the appraiser evaluates the building plans  construction specifications  and estimates of construction costs 
the bank also evaluates the feasibility of the proposed construction project and the experience and track record of the developer 
in addition  all construction loans generally require a commitment from a third party lender or from the bank for a permanent long term loan to replace the construction loan upon completion of construction 
residential mortgage loans at december   bancorp s residential mortgage loan portfolio totaled  or of bancorp s loan portfolio 
all of bancorp s residential mortgage loans are secured by one to four family residential properties 
loans secured by residential properties generally have less risk than other loans because they are generally the primary residence of the borrower 
commercial real estate loans at december   bancorp s commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled  or of bancorp s loan portfolio 
all of bancorp s commercial real estate loans are secured by improved property such as office buildings  retail strip shopping centers  industrial condominium units and other small businesses  most of which are located in the bank s primary lending area 
the largest commercial real estate loan outstanding at december  was a  loan secured by an office building in annapolis  maryland 
this loan has consistently performed in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument 
loans secured by commercial real estate properties generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
construction and land acquisition and development loans the bank originates loans to finance the construction of one to four family dwellings  and to a lesser extent  commercial real estate 
it also originates loans for the acquisition and development of unimproved property to be used for residential and or commercial purposes in cases where the bank is to provide the construction funds to improve the properties 
as of december   bancorp had construction loans outstanding in the gross aggregate amount of  representing of its loan portfolio 
there were also commitments to advance an additional  of which  is owner funded 
construction loan amounts are based on the appraised value of the property and  for builder loans  a feasibility study as to the potential marketability and profitability of the project 
construction loans generally have terms of up to one year  with reasonable extensions as needed  and typically have interest rates that float monthly at margins ranging from the prime rate to percent above the prime rate 
in addition to builders projects  the bank finances the construction of single family  owner occupied houses where qualified contractors are involved and on the basis of strict written underwriting and construction loan guidelines 
construction loans are structured either to be converted to permanent loans with the bank upon the expiration of the construction phase or to be paid off by financing from another financial institution 
construction loans afford the bank the opportunity to increase the interest rate sensitivity of its loan portfolio and to receive yields higher than those obtainable on loans secured by existing residential properties 
these higher yields correspond to the higher risks associated with construction lending 
construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction that is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it is relatively difficult to value accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
as a result  construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in part  on the ultimate success of the project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if the bank is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion  due to a default  there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs 
in addition  the bank may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time 
the bank has attempted to address these risks through its underwriting procedures and its limited amount of construction lending on multi family and commercial real estate properties 
it is the policy of the bank to conduct physical inspections of each property secured by a construction or rehabilitation loan for the purpose of reporting upon the progress of the construction of improvements 
these inspections  referred to as construction draw inspections  are to be performed at the time of a request for an advance of construction funds 
if no construction advance has been requested  a fee inspector or senior officer of the institution makes an inspection of the subject property at least quarterly 
land and residential building lots land loans include loans to developers for the development of residential subdivisions and loans on unimproved lots primarily to individuals 
at december   bancorp had outstanding land and residential building lot loans totaling  or of the total loan portfolio 
the largest of these loans for  is secured by thirty lots in davidsonville  maryland  and has performed in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument 
land development loans typically are short term loans  the duration of these loans is typically not greater than three years 
the interest rate on land loans is generally at least or over the prime rate 
the loan to value ratio generally does not exceed at the time of loan origination 
land and residential building lot loans typically are made to customers of the bank and developers and contractors with whom the bank has had previous lending experience 
in addition to the customary requirements for these types of loans  the bank may also require a satisfactory phase i environmental study and feasibility study to determine the profit potential of the development 
other business and commercial loans the bank also offers other business and commercial loans 
these are loans to businesses are typically lines of credit or other loans that are not secured by real estate  although equipment  securities  or other collateral may secure them 
they typically are offered to customers with long standing relationships with the bank 
at december    or  of the loan portfolio consisted of lines of credit and other commercial loans 
home equity and other consumer loans the bank also offers other loans to consumers  including home equity loans  home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans 
at december    or of the loan portfolio consisted of these loans 
loan portfolio cash flows the following table sets forth the estimated maturity of bancorp s loan portfolios by type of loan at december  the estimated maturity reflects contractual terms at december  contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual life of the bank s loan portfolios 
the average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and because of enforcement of due on sale clauses 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan rates substantially exceed rates on existing mortgage loans

the bank s three largest loans at december  were a  loan secured by an office building located in annapolis  maryland  a  loan secured by residential lots in davidsonville  maryland and a  loan secured by commercial property located in norfolk  virginia 
all three loans are performing as agreed 
origination and purchase and sale of loans the bank originates residential loans in conformity with standard underwriting criteria to assure maximum eligibility for possible resale in the secondary market 
although the bank has authority to lend anywhere in the united states  it has confined its loan origination activities primarily to the states of maryland  virginia and delaware 
loan originations are developed from a number of sources  primarily from referrals from real estate brokers  internet leads  builders  and existing and walk in customers 
the bank s mortgage loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower ability to repay the loan  the viability of the loan  and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan 
the loan committee of the bank can approve single residential and commercial loans up to  and loans that aggregate up to  to one borrower 
single loans greater than  or loans to one borrower aggregating more than  up to  the maximum amount of loans to one borrower as of december   must also have board of directors approval 
the bank utilizes independent qualified appraisers approved by the board of directors to appraise the properties securing its loans and requires title insurance or title opinions so as to insure that the bank has a valid lien on the mortgaged real estate 
the bank requires borrowers to maintain fire and casualty insurance on its secured properties 
the procedure for approval of construction loans is the same as for residential mortgage loans  except that the appraiser evaluates the building plans  construction specifications  and estimates of construction costs 
the bank also evaluates the feasibility of the proposed construction project and the experience and track record of the developer 
in addition  all construction loans generally require a commitment from a third party lender or from the bank for a permanent long term loan to replace the construction loan upon completion of construction 
consumer loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower credit history and an analysis of the borrower income and expenses  ability to repay the loan  and the value of the collateral  if any 
currently  it is the bank s policy to originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans 
the bank is currently active in the secondary market and sells a portion of its fixed rate loans 
interest rates  points and fees the bank realizes interest  point  and fee income from its lending activities 
the bank also realizes income from commitment fees for making commitments to originate loans  and from prepayment and late charges  loan fees  application fees  and fees for other miscellaneous services 
the bank accounts for loan origination fees in accordance with standards set on the accounting for deferred costs and fees 
these standards prohibit the immediate recognition of loan origination fees as revenues and require that such income net of certain direct loan origination costs for each loan be amortized  generally by the interest method  over the estimated life of the loan as an adjustment of yield 
the bank also realizes income from gains on sales of loans  and servicing released fees for loans sold with servicing released 
delinquencies and classified assets and allowance for loan losses delinquencies the board of directors reviews delinquencies on all loans monthly 
the bancorp s collection procedures include sending a past due notice to the borrower on the th day of nonpayment  making telephone contact with the borrower between and days after nonpayment  and sending a letter after the th day of nonpayment 
a notice of intent to foreclose is generally sent between and days after delinquency 
when the borrower is contacted  bancorp attempts to obtain full payment of the past due amount 
however  bancorp generally will seek to reach agreement with the borrower on a payment plan to avoid foreclosure 
an allowance for loan losses is provided through charges to income in an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  based on evaluations of the collectability of loans and prior loan loss experience 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which is permitted under generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
management believes the allowance for losses on loans is adequate 
while management uses available information to estimate losses on loans  future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  particularly in the state of maryland 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank allowance for losses on loans 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired 
when a real estate secured loan becomes impaired  a decision is made as to whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary 
this decision is based on various considerations  including the age of the most recent appraisal  the loan to value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property 
appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral  which is considered to be the estimated fair value 
the discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property 
for loans secured by non real estate collateral  such as accounts receivable  inventory and equipment  estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower s financial statements  inventory reports  accounts receivable aging or equipment appraisals or invoices 
indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information and the quality of the assets 
for such loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the current market value of the underlying collateral less its estimated disposal costs is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
for loans that are not solely collateral dependent  an allowance is established when the present value of the expected future cash flows of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component relates to loans that are classified as substandard or special mention that are not considered impaired  as well as non classified loans 
the general reserve is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
these qualitative factors include levels and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals  inherent risk in the loan portfolio  trends in volume and terms of the loan  effects of any change in lending policies and procedures  experience  ability and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and effect of any changes in concentration of credit 
a loan is generally considered impaired if it meets either of the following two criteria loans that are days or more in arrears nonaccrual loans  or loans where  based on current information and events  it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
loans classified special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention 
if uncorrected  the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects 
loans classified substandard have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of current conditions and facts  is highly improbable 
loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
loans not classified are rated pass 
a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring when bancorp for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
loan modifications made with terms consistent with current market conditions that the borrower could obtain in the open market are not considered troubled debt restructurings 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
the bank discontinues the accrual of interest on loans days or more past due  at which time all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from income 
 in interest income would have been recorded for the year ended december  if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the year ended december  or since their origination if held for only part of the fiscal year 
for the year ended december    in interest income on such loans was actually included in net income

classified assets and allowance for loan losses federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets  such as debt and equity securities  considered by the occ to be of lesser quality  as substandard  doubtful or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if the paying capacity and net worth of the obligor or the collateral pledged  if any  inadequately protects it 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values 
assets classified as loss assets are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification in one of these categories but possess credit deficiencies or potential weakness are required to be designated special mention by management 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish general allowances for losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss assets  it is to charge off such amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its assets is subject to scrutiny by the occ  which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
the bank reviews monthly the assets in its portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations

the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which is permitted under generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
management believes the allowance for losses on loans is adequate 
while management uses available information to estimate losses on loans  future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  particularly in the state of maryland 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank allowance for losses on loans 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired 
when a real estate secured loan becomes impaired  a decision is made as to whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary 
this decision is based on various considerations  including the age of the most recent appraisal  the loan to value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property 
appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral  which is considered to be the estimated fair value 
the discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property 
for loans secured by non real estate collateral  such as accounts receivable  inventory and equipment  estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower s financial statements  inventory reports  accounts receivable aging or equipment appraisals or invoices 
indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets 
for such loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the current market value of the underlying collateral less its estimated disposal costs is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
for loans that are not solely collateral dependent  an allowance is established when the present value of the expected future cash flows of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component relates to loans that are classified as doubtful  substandard or special mention that are not considered impaired  as well as non classified loans 
the general reserve is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
these qualitative factors include levels and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals  inherent risk in the loan portfolio  trends in volume and terms of the loan  effects of any change in lending policies and procedures  experience  ability and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and effect of any changes in concentration of credit 
a loan is generally considered impaired if it meets either of the following two criteria loans that are days or more in arrears nonaccrual loans  or loans where  based on current information and events  it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
loans classified special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention 
if uncorrected  the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects 
loans classified substandard have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of current conditions and facts  is highly improbable 
loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
loans not classified are rated pass 
a loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring tdr when bancorp  for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider 
loan modifications made with terms consistent with current market conditions that the borrower could obtain in the open market are not considered a tdr 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
investment activities federal thrift institutions  such as the bank  have authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including united states treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies  certificates of deposit at insured banks  bankers acceptances and federal funds 
as a member of the fhlb system  the bank must maintain minimum levels of liquid assets specified by the occ  which vary from time to time 
subject to various regulatory restrictions  federal thrift institutions may also invest a portion of their assets in certain commercial paper  corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federal thrift institution is authorized to make directly

deposits deposits are attracted principally from within the bank s primary market areas through the offering of a variety of deposit instruments  including passbook and statement accounts and certificates of deposit ranging in terms from three months to five years 
deposit account terms vary  principally on the basis of the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate 
the bank also offers individual retirement accounts 
the bank s policies are designed primarily to attract deposits from local residents rather than to solicit deposits from areas outside the bank s primary markets

liquidity is the measure of a company s ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to fund operations and to meet financial obligations to depositors and borrowers 
liquidity is provided by the ability to attract and retain deposits and by principal and interest payments on loans and maturing securities in the investment portfolio 
a strong core deposit base  supplemented by other deposits of varying maturities and rates  contributes to the bank s liquidity 
management believes that funds available through short term borrowings and asset maturities are adequate to meet all anticipated needs  and management is continually monitoring the bank s liquidity position to meet projected needs 
interest rate sensitivity is maintaining the ability to reprice interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in relationship to changes in the general level of interest rates 
management attributes interest rate sensitivity to a steady net interest margin through all phases of interest rate cycles 
management attempts to make the necessary adjustments to constrain adverse swings in net interest income resulting from interest rate movements through gap analysis and income simulation modeling techniques

regulation the financial services industry in the bank s market area is highly competitive  including competition from commercial banks  savings banks  credit unions  finance companies and non bank providers of financial services 
several of the bank s competitors have legal lending limits that exceed that of the bank s  as well as funding sources in the capital markets that exceeds the bank s availability 
the increased competition has resulted from a changing legal and regulatory climate  as well as from the economic climate 
general savings and loan holding companies and savings associations are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
this regulation is intended primarily to protect depositors and the deposit insurance fund dif  and not the stockholders of bancorp 
the summary below describes briefly the regulation that is applicable to bancorp and the bank  does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations 
regulatory reform and legislation on july   congress enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and significantly impacted the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies have been given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations  and consequently  many of the details and future impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for many months or years 
the discussion below generally discusses the material provisions of the dodd frank act applicable to bancorp and the bank and is not complete or meant to be an exhaustive discussion 
certain provisions of the dodd frank act have already affected bancorp 
effective july   the ots  which was the primary federal regulator for bancorp and the bank  was abolished and replaced by the frb with respect to savings and loan holding companies and their non depository institution subsidiaries  including bancorp  and the occ with respect to federal savings associations  including the bank 
the dodd frank act also created a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
savings institutions with billion or less in assets  such as the bank  continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators 
effective july   the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits were eliminated  thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts 
the dodd frank act weakened the federal preemption rules applicable to national banks and federal savings associations  allowing federal law to preempt state law only where state law i would have a discriminatory effect on federal savings associations  ii would prevent or significantly interfere with the exercise by a federal savings association of its powers or iii is preempted by other federal law 
the occ has the authority to make preemption determinations and must make each determination on a case by case basis 
the dodd frank act directed the fdic to redefine the base for deposit insurance assessments paid by banks 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity of a financial institution 
this change may proportionally shift deposit insurance funding away from banks that rely primarily on deposits for funding operations  like the bank 
the dodd frank act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  and extended the fdic s program of insuring non interest bearing transaction accounts on an unlimited basis until december  the minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund has been increased from to of estimated insured deposits 
the dodd frank act amended the home owners loan act hola to require that leverage capital requirements and risk based capital requirements applicable to depository and bank holding companies be extended to thrift holding companies 
it also applied the federal reserve board s source of strength doctrine  which has long applied to bank holding companies  to savings and loan holding companies 
pursuant to the doctrine  regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital  liquidity and other support in times of financial stress 
the dodd frank act also included several provisions regarding executive compensation 
publically traded companies must give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and so called golden parachute payments 
companies will be required to disclose the relationship between executive compensation and financial performance of the issuer in annual proxy materials 
it is difficult to predict the exact impact the dodd frank act and the implementing rules and regulations will have on savings and loan holding companies and banks 
the dodd frank act and resulting rules and regulations may impact the profitability of our business or change certain of our business practices  including our ability to offer new products  make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads  and could expose us to additional costs  including increased regulatory compliance costs 
the changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to our operations in order to comply  and could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the following provides a description of the current regulations that are applicable to bancorp and the bank and selected changes to be implemented pursuant to the dodd frank act  all of which are subject to further change as additional provisions of the dodd frank act are implemented 
regulation of bancorp general 
as previously noted  the dodd frank act eliminated the ots and transferred supervision of savings and loan holding companies to the frb on july  as a unitary savings and loan holding company  bancorp is now required to register and file reports with the frb and is subject to regulation and examination by the frb 
in addition  the frb has enforcement authority over bancorp and its subsidiaries  which permits the frb to restrict or prohibit activities determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings association 
activities restriction test 
as a unitary savings and loan holding company  bancorp generally is not subject to activity restrictions  provided the bank satisfies the qualified thrift lender qtl test 
the termination of the unitary thrift holding company exemption in did not affect bancorp because bancorp was grandfathered under the law 
under certain circumstances  bancorp could lose its grandfathered status 
if the bank failed to meet the qtl test  then bancorp would become subject to the activities restrictions applicable to multiple savings and loan holding companies and  unless the bank qualified as a qtl within one year thereafter  bancorp would be required to register as  and would become subject to the restrictions applicable to  a bank holding company 
additionally  if bancorp acquired control of another savings association  either through merger or other combination with the bank  other than in a supervisory acquisition where the acquired association also met the qtl test  bancorp would thereupon become a multiple savings and loan holding company and thereafter be subject to further restrictions on its activities 
bancorp presently intends to continue to operate as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
restrictions on acquisitions 
except under limited circumstances  savings and loan holding companies  such as bancorp  are prohibited from i acquiring  without prior approval of the frb  more than of the voting shares of a savings association or a holding company which is not a subsidiary thereof or ii acquiring control of an uninsured institution  or retaining  for more than one year after the date of any savings association becomes uninsured  control of such association 
in evaluating proposed acquisitions of savings institutions by holding companies  the frb considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the holding company and the target institution  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the dif  the convenience and the needs of the community and competitive factors 
no director or officer of a savings and loan holding company or person owning or controlling by proxy or otherwise more than of such company s stock  may acquire control of any savings association  other than a subsidiary savings association  or of any other savings and loan holding company  without written approval of the frb 
certain individuals  including alan j 
hyatt  louis hyatt  and melvin hyatt  and their respective spouses applicants  filed an application for notice of change in control notice in april pursuant to cfr section b 
the notice permitted the applicants to acquire up to of bancorp s issued and outstanding shares of stock of bancorp by april  the ots approved requests by the applicants to extend the time to consummate such acquisition of shares to december  the applicants currently own approximately of the total outstanding shares of bancorp as of december  the frb is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state  subject to two exceptions i the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies  and ii the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions 
the states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions 
federal securities law 
bancorp s securities are registered with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
as such  bancorp is subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading  and other requirements and restrictions of the securities exchange act of financial services modernization legislation 
in november  the gramm leach bliley act of glba was enacted 
the glba generally permits banks  other depository institutions  insurance companies and securities firms to enter into combinations that result in a single financial services organization to offer customers a wider array of financial services and products provided that they do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the glba resulted in increased competition for bancorp and the bank from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than bancorp and the bank 
troubled assets relief program 
during the fourth quarter of  the us department of the treasury the treasury instituted the troubled assets relief program the tarp pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa in an effort to stabilize the nation s capital markets 
to carry out the tarp  the treasury established the capital purchase program the cpp which financial institutions may participate in on a voluntary basis 
bancorp elected to participate in the cpp and entered into agreements to sell certain securities to the treasury on november  the cpp agreements 
as a result of the cpp agreements  bancorp is subject to certain restrictions  requirements and limitations related to executive compensation  dividend payments and stock repurchase activities 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra and the regulations adopted thereunder have imposed additional compensation restrictions on companies participating in the tarp 
as directed by arra  the department of the treasury has adopted standards for executive compensation that include limits on compensation that exclude incentives to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the participant  provision for recovery by the participant of any bonus  retention award or incentive compensation paid to any senior executive office and up to next mostly highly compensated employees of the participant based on statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria that are later found to be materially inaccurate  and prohibitions on bonus  retention awards or incentive compensation to certain senior employees  among other provisions 
tarp participants are required to annually allow shareholders to have a separate non binding vote on executive compensation while a tarp investment is outstanding 
maryland corporation law 
bancorp is incorporated under the laws of the state of maryland  and is therefore subject to regulation by the state of maryland 
the rights of bancorp s stockholders are governed by the maryland general corporation law 
regulation of the bank general 
as noted above  the dodd frank act transferred supervision of savings associations like the bank to the occ  the agency that regulates national banks  on july  as a federally chartered  dif insured savings association  the bank is subject to extensive regulation by the occ and the fdic 
lending activities and other investments of the bank must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements 
the bank is also subject to certain reserve requirements promulgated by the frb 
the occ  in conjunction with the fdic  regularly examines the bank and prepares reports for the consideration of the bank s board of directors on any deficiencies found in the operations of the bank 
the relationship between the bank and depositors and borrowers is also regulated by federal and state laws  especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of mortgage documents utilized by the bank 
the bank must file reports with the occ and the fdic concerning its activities and financial condition  in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions such as mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions 
regulatory capital requirements 
occ regulations require the bank to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital including i tangible capital equal to at least of adjusted total assets  ii a leverage ratio consisting of tier or core capital equal to at least or  if the bank receives the highest camels rating under the uniform financial institutions rating system of adjusted total assets  and iii risk based capital equal to at least of total risk weighted assets 
tier  or core capital includes common stockholder s equity including retained earnings  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and certain non withdrawable accounts or pledged deposits 
tier core capital is generally reduced by the amount of the saving s institution s intangible assets 
limited exceptions to the deduction of intangible assets exist for certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships and qualifying supervisory goodwill 
tangible capital is generally defined the same as core capital but does not include an exception for qualifying supervisory goodwill and is reduced by the amount of all the savings association s intangible assets with only limited exceptions  including certain mortgage servicing rights 
both core and tangible capital are further reduced by an amount equal to a savings institution s debt and equity investments in subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for national banks other than subsidiaries engaged in activities undertaken as agent for customers or in mortgage banking activities and subsidiary depository institutions or their holding companies 
investments in and extensions of credit to such subsidiaries are required to be fully netted against tangible and core capital 
at december   the bank had no such investments 
total capital equals the sum of tier core capital and supplementary capital  to the extent that supplementary capital does not exceed tier core capital 
supplementary capital includes  among other items  cumulative perpetual preferred stock  long term preferred stock  subordinated debt  mandatory convertible securities  intermediate term preferred stock  the portion of allowance for loan losses not designated for specific loan losses up to of risk weighted assets and up to of unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities 
a savings institution s risk based capital requirement is measured against risk weighted assets  which equal the sum of each on balance sheet asset and the credit equivalent amount of each off balance sheet item after each is multiplied by an assigned risk weight 
these risk weights range from for cash to for consumer or commercial loans  home equity loans  repossessed assets or assets that are more than days past due 
in addition to requiring institutions to meet the applicable capital standards for savings institutions  the occ may require institutions to meet capital standards in excess of the prescribed standards as the occ determines necessary or appropriate for such institution in light of the particular circumstances of the institution 
such circumstances would include a high degree of exposure to interest rate risk  concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from non traditional activity 
the occ may treat the failure of any savings institution to maintain capital at or above such level as an unsafe or unsound practice and may issue a directive requiring any savings institution which fails to maintain capital at or above the minimum level required by the occ to submit and adhere to a plan for increasing capital 
as shown below  the bank s regulatory capital exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements applicable to it as of december  and actual required for capital adequacy purposes required to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions amount amount amount dollars in thousands december  tangible   n a n a tier capital  n a n a  core total december  restated tangible   n a n a tier capital  n a n a  core total to adjusted total assets 
to risk weighted assets 
proposed changes to regulatory capital requirement 
in june  the fdic and other federal banking agencies issued a series of proposed rules to conform us regulatory capital rules with the international regulatory standards agreed to by the basel committee on banking supervision in the international accord referred to as basel iii 
the proposed revisions  if adopted  would establish new higher capital ratio requirements  narrow the definitions of capital  impose new operating restrictions on banking organizations with insufficient capital buffers and increase the risk weighting of certain assets 
the proposed new requirements would apply to all banks and savings associations  bank holding companies with more than million in assets and all savings and loan holding companies regardless of size 
the comment period for the notices of proposed rulemakings ended on october  under the proposed rules  basel iii would be implemented beginning january  and fully phased in by january  under the proposed rules  a new capital measure would be established  common equity tier capital  consisting of common stock and related surplus  retained earnings  accumulated other comprehensive income and  subject to certain adjustments  minority common equity interests in subsidiaries 
depository institutions and their holding companies would be required to maintain common equity tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets by the proposed rules would also increase the tier capital ratio to from and impose a minimum tier leverage ratio of for all institutions 
trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred securities generally would not qualify for inclusion in tier capital 
the minimum required ratio of total capital would remain at 
the proposed rules would also implement a capital buffer of at least which would be phased in beginning on january  through january  if the capital level of an institution were to fall below the buffer amount  the institutions would be subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings than can be paid out in dividends  used in share repurchase and used in the payment of discretionary bonuses to executive officers 
the proposed rules would also revise the prompt corrective action framework discussed below by incorporating the new regulatory capital minimums and updating the definition of tangible common equity and would change the risk weightings of assets used to determine required capital ratios 
the us federal banking agencies announced on november  that they did not expect the proposed rules to become effective on january  and did not indicate the likely new effective date 
enforcement 
the occ has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against the institution and all institution affiliated parties  including stockholders  attorneys  appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution 
formal enforcement actions by the occ may range from issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order  to removal of officers or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
the fdic also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the director of the occ that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution 
if action is not taken by the director of the occ  the fdic has authority to take action under specific circumstances 
safety and soundness standards 
federal law requires each federal banking agency  including the occ  to prescribe to certain standards relating to internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines further provide that savings institutions should maintain safeguards to prevent the payment of compensation  fees and benefits that are excessive or that could lead to material financial loss  and should take into account factors such as comparable compensation practices at comparable institutions 
if the occ determines that a savings institution is not in compliance with the safety and soundness guidelines  it may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the guidelines 
a savings institution must submit an acceptable compliance plan to the occ within days of receipt of a request for such a plan 
if the institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  the occ must issue an order directing the institution to correct the deficiency 
failure to submit or implement a compliance plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
prompt corrective action 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the occ is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings associations 
the leverage ratio  risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio are used to determine an institution s capital classification 
for this purpose  a savings association is placed into one of the following five categories dependent on their respective capital ratios well capitalized at least leverage ratio  tier risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio  adequately capitalized at least leverage ratio or if the savings association is assigned a composite rating of  tier risk based capital ratio and total risk based capital ratio  undercapitalized less than leverage ratio or if the savings association is assigned a composite rating of  tier risk based capital ratio or total risk based capital ratio  significantly undercapitalized less than leverage ratio  tier risk based capital ratio or total risk based capital ratio  and critically undercapitalized less than ratio of tangible equity to total assets 
generally  the federal deposit insurance act requires the occ to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution within days of that institution becoming critically undercapitalized 
the regulation also provides that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the occ within days after an institution receives notice that it is undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized 
in addition  numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution  including  but not limited to  restrictions on growth  investment activities  payment of dividends and other capital distributions  and affiliate transactions 
the occ may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against the undercapitalized institutions  including the issuance of a capital directive and  in the case of an institution that fails to file a required capital restoration plan  the replacement of senior executive officers and directors 
as of december   the bank met the capital requirements of a well capitalized institution under applicable occ regulations 
proposed changes to prompt corrective action 
the proposed rules issued in connection with implementation of basel iii international standards discussed in the proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements section above would revise the adequately capitalized and well capitalized categories 
under the proposed rules  to be well capitalized  a savings association would be required to have at least a total risk based capital ratio  an tier risk based capital ratio  a common equity tier risk based capital ratio and a tier leverage ratio 
to be adequately capitalized  a savings association would be required to have at least an total risk based capital ratio  a tier risk based capital ratio  a common equity tier risk based capital ratio and a tier leverage ratio 
premiums for deposit insurance 
the bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the dif of the fdic and are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
the fdic regulations assess insurance premiums based on an institution s risk 
under this assessment system  the fdic evaluates the risk of each financial institution based on its supervisory rating  financial ratios  and long term debt issuer rating 
in  the assessment ranged from to basis points of an institution deposits  depending on its risk category 
on february   the fdic issued final rules  effective april   implementing changes to the assessment rules as mandated by the dodd frank act 
the final rules redefined the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments 
specifically  the rules base assessments on an institution s total assets less tangible capital  as opposed to total deposits 
the base assessment rates range from to basis points for the least risky institutions to to basis points for the riskiest 
the rate schedules will automatically adjust in the future as the dif reaches certain milestones 
on may   the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus tier capital as of june  the amount of the special assessment for any institution was limited to basis points times the institution s assessment base for the second quarter  payable on september  on november   the fdic amended its regulations to require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of   and for purposes of determining the prepayment  the fdic used the institution s assessment rate in effect on september  the prepayment amount for the bank was approximately  as discussed above  the dodd frank act made permanent the maximum deposit insurance amount of  per depositor  and non interest bearing transaction accounts had unlimited deposit insurance until december  the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for the bank could have a material adverse effect on bancorp s earnings  depending on the collective size of the particular institutions involved 
all fdic insured depository institutions pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board 
the bonds  commonly referred to as financing corporation fico bonds  were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
for the quarter ended september   the annualized fico assessment rate equaled basis point for each in domestic deposits maintained at an institution 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  the fico assessment was based on total assets less tangible capital instead of deposits 
the fourth quarter fico assessment rate was basis points and the first quarter fico assessment rate was basis points 
fico assessments will continue until the bonds mature in through the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses of the bank 
privacy 
federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial and annual notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
since the glba s enactment  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
the bank has implemented its privacy policies in accordance with applicable law 
loans to one borrower limitations 
with certain limited exceptions  the maximum amount that a savings association or a national bank may lend on an unsecured basis to any borrower including certain related entities of the borrower may not exceed of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the institution  plus an additional of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
at december   the bank s loans to one borrower limit was  based upon the of unimpaired capital and surplus measurement 
at december   the bank s three largest loans were a  loan secured by an office building located in annapolis  maryland  a  loan secured by residential lots in davidsonville  maryland and a  loan secured by commercial residential property located in norfolk  virginia 
these loans were performing in accordance with their terms 
qualified thrift lender test 
savings associations must meet a qtl test  which may be met either by maintaining  on average  at least of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments in at least nine of the most recent twelve month period  or meeting the definition of a domestic building and loan association as defined in the code 
portfolio assets generally means total assets of a savings institution  less the sum of i specified liquid assets up to of total assets  ii goodwill and other intangible assets  and iii the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association s business 
qualified thrift investments are primarily residential mortgages and related investments  including certain mortgage related securities 
associations that fail to meet the qtl test must either convert to a bank charter or operate under specified restrictions 
as of december   the bank was in compliance with its qtl requirement and met the definition of a domestic building and loan association 
affiliate transactions 
transactions between savings associations and any affiliate are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act as made applicable to savings associations by section of the home owners loan act hola 
a savings association affiliate includes any company or entity which controls the savings institution or that is controlled by a company that controls the savings association 
for example  the holding company of a savings association and any companies which are controlled by such holding company are affiliates of the savings association 
generally  section a limits the extent to which the savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of such association s capital stock and surplus  as well as contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of such capital stock and surplus 
section b applies to covered transactions  as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable  to the savings association as those provided to a non affiliate 
covered transaction include the making of loans to  purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions 
section b transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a savings association to an affiliate 
in addition to the restrictions imposed by sections a and b  section of the home owners loan act prohibits a savings association from i making a loan or other extension of credit to an affiliate  except for any affiliate which engages only in certain activities which are permissible for bank holding companies  or ii purchasing or investing in any stocks  bonds  debentures  notes or similar obligations of any affiliate  except for affiliates which are subsidiaries of the savings association 
the bank s authority to extend credit to executive officers  directors  trustees and stockholders  as well as entities under such person s control  is currently governed by section g and h of the federal reserve act and regulation o promulgated by the frb 
among other things  these regulations generally require such loans to be made on terms substantially similar to those offered to unaffiliated individuals  place limits on the amounts of the loans the bank may make to such persons based  in part  on the bank s capital position  and require certain board of directors approval procedures to be followed 
capital distribution limitations 
occ regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings associations  such as cash dividends  payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares  payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash out merger and other distributions charged against capital 
the occ regulations require a savings association to file an application for approval of a capital distribution if the association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings with the occ  the total amount of all of capital distributions  including the proposed capital distribution  for the applicable calendar year exceeds its net income for that year to date plus retained net income for the preceding two years  the association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution  or the proposed capital distribution would violate any applicable statute  regulation  agreement between the association and the occ or ots  or an occ or ots imposed condition 
in addition  a savings association must give the occ notice of a capital distribution if the savings association is not required to file an application  but would not be well capitalized following the distribution  the proposed capital distribution would reduce the amount of or retire any part of the savings association common or preferred stock or retire any part of debt instruments like notes or debentures included in capital  other than regular payments required under a debt instrument  or the savings association is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company and is not otherwise required to file a notice regarding the proposed distribution with the federal reserve  in which case an information copy of the notice filed with the federal reserve needs to be simultaneously provided to the occ 
the occ may prohibit a proposed capital distribution that would otherwise be permitted if the occ determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution  if after making such distribution the institution would be undercapitalized 
branching 
under occ branching regulations  the bank is generally authorized to open branches within or beyond the state of maryland if the bank qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under the code  which qualification requirements are similar to those for a qualified thrift lender under the home owners loan act  and publishes public notice at least days before opening a branch and no one opposes the branch 
if a comment in opposition to a branch opening is filed and the occ determines the comment to be relevant to the approval process standards  and to require action in response  the occ may  among other things  require a branch application or elect to hold a meeting with the bank and the person who submitted the comment 
the occ authority preempts any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings banks 
community reinvestment act and the fair lending laws 
savings associations have a responsibility under the community reinvestment act and related regulations of the occ to help meet the credit needs of their communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition  the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes 
an institution failure to comply with the provisions of the community reinvestment act could  at a minimum  result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the denial of applications 
in addition  an institution failure to comply with the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act could result in the occ  other federal regulatory agencies as well as the department of justice taking enforcement actions 
based on an examination conducted august   the bank received a satisfactory rating 
federal home loan bank system 
the bank is a member of the fhlb atlanta 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
under the capital plan of the fhlb atlanta as of december   the bank was required to own at least  of the capital stock of the fhlb atlanta 
as of such date  the bank owned  of the capital stock of the fhlb atlanta and was in compliance with the capital plan requirements 
federal reserve system 
the frb requires all depository institutions to maintain non interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts primarily checking  now  and super now checking accounts and non personal time deposits 
at december   the bank was in compliance with these requirements 
activities of subsidiaries 
a savings association seeking to establish a new subsidiary  acquire control of an existing company or conduct a new activity through a subsidiary must provide days prior notice to the fdic and the frb and conduct any activities of the subsidiary in compliance with regulations and orders of the frb 
the frb has the power to require a savings association to divest any subsidiary or terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the frb determines to pose a serious threat to the financial safety  soundness or stability of the savings association or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking practices 
tying arrangements 
federal savings associations are prohibited  subject to some exceptions  from extending credit to or offering any other services  or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service  on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution 
item a 
risk factors unless the context indicates otherwise  all references to we  us  our in this subsection risk factors refer to bancorp and its subsidiaries 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below as well as elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
if any of the risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of future operations could be materially adversely affected 
the risks and uncertainties described in this form k are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we may be adversely affected by changes in economic and political conditions and by governmental monetary and fiscal policies 
the thrift industry is affected  directly and indirectly  by local  domestic  and international economic and political conditions  and by governmental monetary and fiscal policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  volatile interest rates  tight money supply  real estate values  international conflicts and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our potential profitability 
any future rises in interest rates  while increasing the income yield on our earning assets  may adversely affect loan demand and the cost of funds and  consequently  our profitability 
any future decreases in interest rates may adversely affect our profitability because such decreases may reduce the amounts that we may earn on our assets 
economic downturns have resulted and may continue to result in the delinquency of outstanding loans 
we do not expect any one particular factor to materially affect our results of operations 
however  downtrends in several areas  including real estate  construction and consumer spending  have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our ability to remain profitable 
further  there can be no assurance that the asset values of the loans included in our loan portfolio  the value of properties and other collateral securing such loans  or the value of foreclosed real estate will remain at current levels 
the changing economic environment poses significant challenges for bancorp 
negative developments in the financial services industry from into have resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets in general and a related general economic downturn globally 
while we are beginning to experience modest improvement in performance  we may experience similar negative conditions in in addition  as a consequence of the united states recession  business activity across a wide range of industries face serious difficulties due to the decline in the housing market and lack of consumer spending 
unemployment continues to be higher than historical averages 
as a result of these financial economic crises  many lending institutions  including us  have experienced declines in the performance of their loans  including residential  construction  land and residential building lots  multi family  commercial and consumer loans 
moreover  competition among depository institutions for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly while the significant decline in economic growth has led to a slowdown in banking related activities 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry 
as a result  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal or informal enforcement actions or orders 
the impact of new legislation in response to those developments may negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely impact our financial performance or our stock price 
we are operating in a challenging economic environment  including generally uncertain national and local market conditions 
negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provision for credit losses 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses and other factors  could have adverse effects on our borrowers  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for instance  because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent upon the successful operation of management of the properties  repayment of these loans are subject to adverse conditions in the economy 
if consumer spending decreases  businesses located in commercial real estate property may close  reducing the rental income of the bank s borrower 
the reduction in rental income may result in the borrower being unable to make payments on the loan 
the deterioration in economic conditions could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and could result in the following an increase in loan delinquencies  problem assets and foreclosures  a decline in demand for our products and services  a decrease in low cost or non interest bearing deposits  and a decline in the value of the collateral for our loans  which in turn may reduce customers borrowing capacities  and reduce the value of assets and collateral supporting our existing loans 
during the past year  we continued to experience higher than normal levels of non performing loans 
no assurance can be given that these conditions will improve in the near term or will not worsen 
moreover  such conditions may result in a further increase in loan delinquencies  causing a decrease in our interest income  and may continue to have an adverse impact on our loan loss experience  possibly requiring us to add to our allowance for loan losses 
until conditions improve  we expect our business  financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the operations of financial institutions  such as ours  are dependent to a large degree on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest that in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions  fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and the policies of various regulatory agencies 
like all financial institutions  our balance sheet is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation  which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments  such as us government bonds  corporate securities and other investment vehicles  including mutual funds  which  because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements  generally pay higher rates of return than those offered by financial institutions such as ours 
we expect to experience continual competition for deposit accounts which may make it difficult to reduce the interest paid on some deposits 
we believe that  in the current market environment  we have adequate policies and procedures for maintaining a conservative interest rate sensitive position 
however  there is no assurance that this condition will continue 
a sharp movement up or down in deposit rates  loan rates  investment fund rates and other interest sensitive instruments on our balance sheet could have a significant  adverse impact on our net interest income and operating results 
most of our loans are secured by real estate located in our market area 
if there is a continuing downturn in the real estate market  additional borrowers may default on their loans and we may not be able to fully recover our loans 
a continuing downturn in the real estate market could adversely affect our business because most of our loans are secured by real estate 
substantially all of our real estate collateral is located in the states of maryland  virginia and delaware 
real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers  changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes  regulations and policies and acts of nature 
in addition to the risks generally present with respect to mortgage lending activities  our operations are affected by other factors affecting our borrowers  including the ability of our mortgagors to make mortgage payments  the ability of our borrowers to attract and retain buyers or tenants  which may in turn be affected by local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for rental space in the area  the attractiveness of properties to buyers and tenants  and competition from other available space  or by the ability of the owner to pay leasing commissions  provide adequate maintenance and insurance  pay tenant improvements costs and make other tenant concessions  interest rate levels and the availability of credit to refinance loans at or prior to maturity  and increased operating costs  including energy costs  real estate taxes and costs of compliance with environmental controls and regulations 
as of december   approximately of the book value of our loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by various types of real estate 
if real estate prices decline  the value of real estate collateral securing our loans will be reduced 
our ability to recover defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished  and we would be more likely to incur financial losses on defaulted loans 
in addition  approximately of the book value of our loans consisted of construction  land acquisition and development loans  commercial real estate loans and land loans  which present additional risks described in item business construction loans of this form k 
our loan portfolio exhibits a high degree of risk 
we have a significant amount of nonresidential loans  as well as construction and land loans granted on a speculative basis 
although permanent single family  owner occupied loans represent the largest single component of assets and currently impaired loans  a significant level of nonresidential loans  construction loans  and land loans  results in an above average risk exposure 
our monitoring of higher risk loans may be inadequate and the internal asset review function may be inadequate in view of current real estate market weaknesses 
at december  and december   our nonperforming loans those loans or more days in arrears equaled million and million  respectively 
there were residential loans including acquisition and development and land loans in non accrual status totaling million and commercial loans in non accrual status totaling million at december  compared to residential loans in non accrual status totaling million  ten commercial loans in non accrual status totaling million and four consumer loans in non accrual status totaling million at december  for the years ended december  and december   there were million and million of loan charge offs  respectively 
at december   the total allowance for loan losses was million  which was of total net loans  compared with million  which was of total net loans  as of december  we are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title 
in the course of our business  we may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
our operations are located in anne arundel county  maryland  which makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions 
an economic downturn or recession in this area may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
unlike larger banking organizations that are geographically diversified  our operations are concentrated in anne arundel county  maryland 
in addition  nearly all of our loans have been made to borrowers in the states of maryland  virginia and delaware 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in our market area 
a deterioration or recession in economic conditions in this market could result in one or more of the following a decrease in deposits  an increase in loan delinquencies  an increase in problem assets and foreclosures  a decrease in the demand for our products and services  and a decrease in the value of collateral for loans  especially real estate  and reduction in customers borrowing capacities 
any of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
failure to comply with the supervisory agreements could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
on november   we and the bank each entered into a supervisory agreement with the ots  which agreements primarily addressed issues identified in the ots reports of examination of our and the bank s operations and financial condition conducted in these supervisory agreements are now being overseen by the occ and frb 
although we and the bank each intend to take such actions as may be necessary to enable us to comply with our respective requirements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply fully with the provisions of the supervisory agreements  or to do so within the timeframes required 
moreover  there can be no assurance that compliance with such requirements will not be more time consuming or more expensive than anticipated  or that efforts to comply with such requirements will not have adverse effects on the operations and financial condition of us or the bank 
failure to comply with the supervisory agreements  or other supervisory directives  could subject us to significant civil monetary penalties  orders to cease and desist or other regulatory or enforcement actions 
accordingly  any material failure to comply with the supervisory agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are subject to federal and state regulation and the monetary policies of the frb 
such regulation and policies can have a material adverse effect on our earnings and prospects 
our operations are heavily regulated and will be affected by present and future legislation and by the policies established from time to time by various federal and state regulatory authorities 
in particular  the monetary policies of the frb have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past  and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the frb to implement its objectives are changes in the discount rate charged on bank borrowings and changes in the reserve requirements on bank deposits 
it is not possible to predict what changes  if any  will be made to the monetary polices of the frb or to existing federal and state legislation or the effect that such changes may have on our future business and earnings prospects 
if the bank becomes undercapitalized as determined under the prompt corrective action initiatives of the federal bank regulators  such regulatory authorities will have the authority to require the bank to  among other things  alter  reduce or terminate any activity that the regulator determines poses an excessive risk to the bank 
the bank could further be directed to take any other action that the regulatory agency determines will better carry out the purpose of prompt corrective action 
the bank could be subject to these prompt corrective action restrictions if federal regulators determine that the bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice 
some or all of the foregoing actions and restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the dodd frank act  which is still being implemented  may have a material impact on our operations 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act restructures the regulation of depository institutions 
under the dodd frank act  the ots was merged into the occ  which regulates national banks 
savings and loan holding companies are now regulated by the frb 
also  included was the creation of a new federal agency to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws  a function that was previously performed by the depository institution regulators 
the federal preemption of state laws currently accorded federally charted depository institutions was reduced as well 
the dodd frank act also will impose consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies effective in five years  which will limit our ability to borrow at the holding company and invest the proceeds from such borrowings as capital in the bank that could be leveraged to support additional growth 
the dodd frank act contains various other provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in the full impact of the dodd frank act on our business and operations may not be known for years until all regulations implementing the statute are written  adopted and implemented 
the dodd frank act may have a material impact on operations  particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs 
bancorp may become subject to more stringent capital requirements  which may have a material adverse effect on bancorp s operations 
the dodd frank act requires federal banking agencies to establish more stringent risk based capital requirements and leverage limits applicable to banks  savings associations and their holding companies 
under the legislation  federal banking agencies are required to develop capital requirements that address systemically risky activities 
in june  the frb  fdic and occ issued a series of proposed rules that would revise and replace their current capital rules in a manner consistent both with relevant provisions of the dodd frank act as well as the implementation of basel iii 
the proposed revisions  if adopted  would establish new higher capital ratio requirements  narrow the definitions of capital  impose new operating restrictions on banking organizations with insufficient capital buffers and increase the risk weighting of certain assets 
these requirements  and any other new regulations  including those that have been proposed but not yet implemented as a result of the requirements established by the basel committee on banking supervision  could require bancorp to reduce business levels or to raise capital  including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  the costs associated with complying with more stringent capital requirements could have a material adverse effect on bancorp 
we have established an allowance for loan losses based on our management estimates 
actual losses could differ significantly from those estimates 
if the allowance is not adequate  it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and the price of our common stock 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  that represents management best estimate of probable incurred losses within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management continuing evaluation of specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions  industry concentrations and other unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
increases in nonperforming loans have a significant impact on our allowance for loan losses 
generally  our non performing loans and assets reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers resulting from weakness in the economy of our market area 
while bancorp is experiencing better performance results from those experienced in and  loan delinquencies remain higher than usual  particularly with respect to residential construction  land and residential building lots  multi family  commercial and consumer loans 
bancorp has seen a slight increase in troubled debt restructurings balances in compared to  and the balances are still high compared to historical averages 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
furthermore  growth in the loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we compete with a number of local  regional and national financial institutions for customers 
we face strong competition from savings and loan associations  banks  and other financial institutions that have branch offices or otherwise operate in our market area  as well as many other companies now offering a range of financial services 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger branch systems than us 
in addition  many of our competitors have higher legal lending limits than us 
particularly intense competition exists for sources of funds including savings and retail time deposits as well as for loans and other services offered by us 
in addition  over the last several years  the banking industry has undergone substantial consolidation  and this trend is expected to continue 
significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in one or more large competitors emerging in our primary target market 
the financial resources  human capital and expertise of one or more large institutions could threaten our ability to maintain our competitiveness 
during the past several years  significant legislative attention has been focused on the regulation and deregulation of the financial services industry 
non bank financial institutions  such as securities brokerage firms  insurance companies and mutual funds  have been permitted to engage in activities that compete directly with traditional bank business 
competition with various financial institutions could hinder our ability to maintain profitable operations and grow our business 
we face intense competitive pressure on customer pricing  which may materially and adversely affect revenues and profitability 
we generate net interest income  and charge our customers fees  based on prevailing market conditions for deposits  loans and other financial services 
in order to increase deposit  loan and other service volumes  enter new market segments and expand our base of customers and the size of individual relationships  we must provide competitive pricing for such products and services 
in order to stay competitive  we have had to intensify our efforts around attractively pricing our products and services 
to the extent that we must continue to adjust our pricing to stay competitive  we will need to grow our volumes and balances in order to offset the effects of declining net interest income and fee based margins 
increased pricing pressure also enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiatives  and we may not succeed in these efforts 
our brand  reputation and relationship with our customers are key assets of our business and may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 
our brand and its attributes are key assets of our business 
the ability to attract and retain customers to bancorp s products and services is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of us and the industry in which we operate 
our business may be affected by actions taken by competitors  customers  third party providers  employees  regulators  suppliers or others that impact the perception of the brand  such as creditor practices that may be viewed as predatory  customer service quality issues  and employee relations issues 
adverse developments with respect to our industry may also  by association  impair our reputation  or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny 
our business is highly reliant on technology and our ability to manage the operational risks associated with technology 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
our business involves storing and processing sensitive customer data 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in theft of customer data or failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  data storage  processing and other systems 
our inability to access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations 
in addition  we operate a number of money transfer and related electronic  check and other payment connections that are vulnerable to individuals engaging in fraudulent activities that seek to compromise payments and related financial systems illegally 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  result in increased expense to contain the event and or require that we provide credit monitoring services for affected customers or expose us to civil litigation and regulatory fines and sanctions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is highly reliant on third party vendors and our ability to manage the operational risks associated with outsourcing those services 
we rely on third parties to provide services that are integral to our operations 
these vendors provide services that support our operations  including storage and processing of sensitive consumer date 
a cyber security breach of a vendor s system may result in theft of our data or disruption of business processes 
a material breach of customer data at a service provider s site may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customer business  result in increased expense to contain the event and or require that we provide credit monitoring services for affected customers  result in regulatory fines and sanctions and may result in litigation 
in most cases  we will remain primarily liable to our customers for losses arising from a breach of a vendor s data security system 
we rely on our outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cyber security controls 
we have procedures in place to assess a vendor s cyber security controls prior to establishing a contractual relationship and to periodically review assessments of those control systems  however  these procedures are not infallible and a vendor s system can be breached despite the procedures we employ 
if our third party providers experience financial  operational or technological difficulties  or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them  we may be required to locate alternative sources of such services  and we cannot assure you that we would be able to negotiate terms that are as favorable to us  or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources  if at all 
we continually encounter technological change  and  if we are unable to develop and implement efficient and customer friendly technology  we could lose business 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change  with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to achieve additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on our senior management team  and if we are not able to retain our senior management team  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are highly dependent upon the continued services and experience of our senior management team  including alan j 
hyatt  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
we depend on the services of mr 
hyatt and the other members of our senior management team to  among other things  continue the development and implementation of our strategies  and maintain and develop our customer relationships 
we do not have an employment agreement with members of our senior management  nor do we maintain key man life insurance on our senior management 
if we are unable to retain mr 
hyatt and other members of our senior management team  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures  we may be unable to accurately report our financial results and comply with the reporting requirements under the securities exchange act of as a result  current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the securities exchange act of  which could adversely affect our business and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  referred to as section  we are required to include in our annual reports on form k  our management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
we are currently not required to include an opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm as to our internal controls because we are a smaller reporting company under sec rules and  therefore  stockholders do not have the benefit of such an independent review of our internal controls 
we have reported a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the fiscal year ended december  as explained in item a 
controls and procedures 
compliance with the requirements of section is expensive and time consuming 
if  in the future  we fail to complete this evaluation in a timely manner  or  if required  our independent registered public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our evaluation  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  any failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential stockholders and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the securities exchange act of  which could adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure investors that we will be able to fully address the material weakness in our internal controls that led to our restatement  or that remediation efforts will prevent future controls deficiencies 
we have identified control deficiencies in our financial reporting process that constituted a material weakness  leading to restatement of our financial statements 
we have undertaken a number of measures with a view to remediating this weakness  and plan to implement other measures as part of this effort 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully remediate our existing deficiencies 
further  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer from other deficiencies in the future 
any current or future controls deficiencies could impair our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information  which could lead to further restatements  sec inquiries and enforcement actions  penalties  fines  investor litigation and other adverse actions 
terrorist attacks and threats or actual war may impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price in unpredictable ways 
terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad  as well as future events occurring in response to or in connection with them  including  without limitation  future terrorist attacks against us targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the united states or its allies or military or trade disruptions  may impact our operations 
any of these events could cause consumer confidence and savings to decrease or could result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in the volatility of the market price for our common stock and on the future price of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future 
the supervisory agreements with the federal reserve and occ require  among other things  that bancorp and the bank obtain prior occ approval before any dividends or capital distributions can be made and that bancorp obtain prior federal reserve approval before purchasing or redeeming shares of its stock 
in addition  bancorp suspended its common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of to preserve its capital 
although we expect to be able to resume our policy of quarterly dividend payments  this dividend policy will be reviewed in light of future earnings  occ restrictions and other considerations 
no assurance can be given  therefore  that cash dividends on our common stock will be paid in the future 
our series a preferred stock  series b preferred stock and debentures contain restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends on  or repurchase  our common stock 
our ability to declare dividends on our common stock is limited by the terms of our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock 
we may not declare or pay any dividend on  make any distributions relating to  or redeem  purchase  acquire or make a liquidation payment relating to  or make any guarantee payment with respect to our common stock in any quarter until the dividend on the series a preferred stock has been declared and paid for such quarter  subject to certain minor exceptions 
additionally  we may not declare or pay any dividend or distribution on our common stock  and we may not purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration any of our common stock  unless all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods  including the latest completed dividend period  on all outstanding shares of series b preferred stock have been or are contemporaneously declared and paid in full or have been declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside  subject to certain minor exceptions 
dividends on the series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock have not been declared since the first quarter because bancorp did not receive approval from the frb to pay such dividends 
as of december   the cumulative amount of dividends of the series b preferred stock in arrears not declared  including interest on unpaid dividends at per annum  was  accordingly  bancorp will not be able to pay dividends on its common stock until the dividend arrearages on its series b preferred stock have been paid in full 
additionally  the dividend rate on our series b preferred stock will increase from to beginning november   which will increase the amount of dividends that we are required to pay on our series b preferred stock by  per year and decrease the amount available to common stockholders 
further  under the terms of our debentures  if i there has occurred and is continuing an event of default  ii we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under the related guarantee or iii we have given notice of our election to defer payments of interest on the debentures by extending the interest distribution period as provided in the indenture governing the debentures and such period  or any extension thereof  has commenced and is continuing  then we may not  among other things  declare or pay any dividends or distributions on  or redeem  purchase  acquire  or make a liquidation payment with respect to  any of our capital stock  including our common stock 
an investment in our securities is not insured against loss 
investments in our common stock  are not deposits insured against loss by the fdic or any other entity 
as a result  an investor may lose some or all of his  her or its investment 
conversion of our series a preferred stock or exercise of the warrant issued to the treasury department will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders 
in private placements conducted in november  we issued series a preferred stock convertible into  shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment  and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment 
the conversion of some or all of the series a preferred stock or the exercise of the warrant will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion or exercise could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the existence of the series a preferred stock or warrant may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the series a preferred stock or exercise of the warrant could depress the price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions will make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change in control would be beneficial to our equity holders 
our charter presently contains certain provisions that may be deemed to be anti takeover and anti greenmail in nature in that such provisions may deter  discourage or make more difficult the assumption of control of us by another corporation or person through a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or similar transaction or series of transactions 
for example  currently  our charter provides that our board of directors may amend the charter  without stockholder approval  to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of our stock or the number of shares of any class that we have authority to issue 
in addition  our charter provides for a classified board  with each board member serving a staggered three year term 
directors may be removed only for cause and only with the approval of the holders of at least percent of our common stock 
the overall effects of the anti takeover and anti greenmail provisions may be to discourage  make more costly or more difficult  or prevent a future takeover offer  prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their securities in a takeover offer  and enhance the possibility that a future bidder for control of us will be required to act through arms length negotiation with our board of directors 
these provisions may also have the effect of perpetuating incumbent management

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview bancorp has restated its consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and contained in bancorp s annual reports on form k for those years  and unaudited interim consolidated financial statements contained in bancorp s quarterly reports on form q for each of the quarters ended march   and  june   and  and september   and to correct the method used to amortize a three year prepayment made in for bancorp s fdic risk based insurance assessment 
in  bancorp paid an estimated assessment in advance for fiscal years  and based on the level of net assets as of june   and began expensing the prepayment evenly over the three year period covered by the prepayment 
management determined that this method of amortization was incorrect and that it should have amortized the prepayment based on the actual reduced level of net assets over that period 
this error was discovered by management during the course of its preparation of the year end financial statements and audit 
for more information  see explanatory note regarding restatement above and note restatement of financial statements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for information regarding the restated quarterly financial data for bancorp for each of the quarters in the  and fiscal years  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
bancorp provides a wide range of personal and commercial banking services 
personal services include various lending services as well as deposit products such as checking accounts  individual retirement accounts  money market accounts  and savings and time deposit accounts 
commercial services include commercial secured and unsecured lending services as well as business internet banking  corporate cash management services and deposit services 
bancorp also provides atms  debit cards  internet banking including on line bill pay  mortgage lending  safe deposit boxes  and telephone banking  among other products and services 
bancorp has experienced improved earnings from those experienced during the second half of and all of as it continues to see some improvement in the national and local economic environment 
management believes that bancorp s  and results  while significantly better than  do not mean that it will not continue to experience the challenges it and many other financial institutions faced in and as a result of the economic recession 
those challenges  including increased loan delinquencies and a decrease in the demand for certain loan products including construction  development  and land acquisition loans  continue to show signs of improvement from and however  continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the recession  including job losses and other factors  have continued to affect bancorp s borrowers 
management believes that this economic deterioration has continued to be stable in since having stabilized somewhat in which has resulted in stabilization in loan delinquencies from levels 
while the interest rate spread between bancorp s cost of funds and what it earns on loans has increased from levels  competition for new loans and deposits remains strong 
the slight decrease in interest rate spread in compared to was caused in part by the decrease in interest rates earned on loans outpacing the decrease in interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
bancorp s total loan portfolio has decreased from and bancorp has experienced a modest decrease in loan delinquencies  which resulted in the allowance for loan losses decreasing from the decrease in the allowance was primarily due to million charge offs of impaired collateral dependent loans 
bancorp has seen a decrease in the level of foreclosed real estate expenses in as compared to due to fewer loans going to foreclosure 
bancorp expects to experience continued improvement in market conditions in  as the effects of the economic downturn continue to improve and as the employment environment in its market improves 
however  if interest rates increase  demand for borrowing may remain low and bancorp s interest rate spread could decrease 
bancorp will continue to manage loan and deposit pricing against the risks of rising costs of its deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are outside the control of bancorp  so it must attempt to balance its pricing and duration of its loan portfolio against the risks of rising costs of its deposits and borrowings 
the continued success and attraction of anne arundel county  maryland  and vicinity  will also be important to bancorp s ability to originate and grow its mortgage loans and deposits  as will bancorp s continued focus on maintaining a low overhead 
if the volatility in the market and the economy continues or worsens  our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to funds and the price of our stock could be materially and adversely impacted 
on november   bancorp and the bank each entered into a supervisory agreement with the ots which primarily addressed the issues identified in the ots reports of examination of bancorp s and the bank s operations and financial condition in the bank s supervisory agreement is now enforced by the occ and bancorp s by frb 
see item business supervisory agreements for more information 
critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements bancorp s significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements are set forth in note of the consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this form k 
of these significant accounting policies  bancorp considers the policies regarding the allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed real estate to be its most critical accounting policies  given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
in addition  changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on real estate values of underlying collateral affecting the allowance for loan losses and therefore the provision for loan losses and results of operations as well as the valuation of foreclosed real estate 
bancorp has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this process requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
bancorp s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers that is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements

this was achieved by retaining more customer deposits than necessary given the lower loan demand and loan payoffs 
investments investment securities held to maturity decreased by  or  at december  to  compared to  at december  this decrease was primarily due to management s decision to not purchase us treasury and agency securities to replace securities which matured in loans loans held for sale

total loans receivable  net decreased by  or at december   to  compared to  at december  the decrease in the loan portfolio was a result of decreased loan demand from the economic slowdown 
in addition  the allowance for loan losses decreased by  or  at december  to  compared to  at december  the decrease in the allowance was primarily due to million charge offs of impaired collateral dependent loans and a decrease in loans receivable and an improvement in loan delinquencies 
foreclosed real estate foreclosed real estate decreased by  or  at december  to  compared to  at december  this decrease was primarily due to foreclosed properties being sold and additional write downs taken partially offset by new loan foreclosures 
premises and equipment premises and equipment decreased by  or  at december  to  compared to  at december  this decrease was primarily due to the annual depreciation of the premises and equipment with minimal new fixed assets added throughout other assets other assets decreased by  or  at december  to  compared to the restated amount of  at december  this decrease was primarily due to decreases in net deferred income taxes of  and accrued interest receivable of  in liabilities deposits 
total deposits decreased by  or  at december  to  compared to  at december  this decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in certificates of deposits of  and passbooks of  partially offset by increases in now accounts of  due to management s decision to actively promote its demand deposits

unadvanced construction loans decreased  or  as of december  to  compared to  as of december  this decrease was primarily the result of the funding of existing construction loan obligations outpacing new construction loan originations 
home equity lines of credit decreased  or  as of december  to  compared to  as of december  this decrease was primarily due to lower customer demand for home equity loans in home equity lines of credit allow the borrowers to draw funds up to a specified loan amount  from time to time 
bancorp s management believes it has sufficient liquidity resources to have the funding available as these borrowers draw on these loans 
mortgage loan commitments increased  or  as of december  to  compared to  as of december  this increase was primarily due to the timing of loan commitments booked at year end 
loan commitments are obligations of bancorp to provide loans  and such commitments are made in the usual course of business 
lines of credit  which are obligations of bancorp to fund loans made to certain borrowers  decreased  or  to  as of december   compared to  as of december  the decrease was a result of slightly lower demand for this type of loan product during bancorp s management believes it has sufficient liquidity resources to have the funding available as these borrowers draw on these loans 
loans sold and serviced with limited repurchase provisions increased  or as of december  to  compared to  as of december  this increase was the result of a greater volume of loans sold in the secondary market in bancorp uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for its on balance sheet instruments

net interest income 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bancorp s loan volume and to a decrease in the interest rate spread 
bancorp s interest rate spread decreased by to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of interest rates earned on bancorp s loan portfolio decreasing faster than the decrease in interest rates paid on bancorp s interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  bancorp s non accrual loans increased from  at december  to  at december  this resulted in  of interest income not recorded on non accrual loans in  compared to  of unrecorded interest in bancorp discontinues the accrual of interest on all non accrual loans  at which time all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from income 
bancorp is uncertain whether it will be able to further reduce the interest rate paid on its interest bearing liabilities by attracting lower cost deposits  due to the general expectation of continued increased competition for deposit accounts 
provision for loan losses 
bancorp s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk and an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
credit risk includes  but is not limited to  the potential for borrower default and the failure of collateral to be worth what the bank determined it was worth at the time of the granting of the loan 
the bank monitors its loan portfolio loan delinquencies at least as often as monthly 
all loans that are delinquent and all loans within the various categories of the bank s portfolio as a group are evaluated 
the bank s board  with the advice and recommendation of the bank s loss mitigation committee  estimates an allowance to be set aside for loan losses 
included in determining the calculation are such factors as historical losses for each loan portfolio  current market value of the loan s underlying collateral  inherent risk contained within the portfolio after considering the state of the general economy  economic trends  consideration of particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending and consideration of known information that may affect loan collectibility 
a decrease in the loan loss provision from the beginning of the year to the end of a year is the result after an analysis of the aforementioned factors and applying that rationale to the total portfolio 
the total allowance for loan losses decreased  or  to  as of december   compared to  as of december  the decrease in the allowance was due to a modification of the bank s loan classification and charge off practice to more closely align it to those of other institutions regulated by the occ which caused the bank to charge off loans earlier than it previously had done 
the classification of loan impairment as loss is now based upon a confirmed expectation for loss  rather than simply equating impairment with a loss classification by default 
for loans primarily secured by real estate  the expectation for loss is generally confirmed when a impairment is identified on a loan individually evaluated in the manner described below and  b the loan is presumed to be collateral dependent such that the source of loan repayment is expected to arise solely from sale of collateral securing the application loan 
impairment identified on non collateral dependent loans may or may not be eligible for a loss classification depending upon the other salient facts and circumstances that affect the manner and likelihood of loan repayment 
however  loan impairment that is classified as loss is now charged off against the allowance for loan losses concurrent with that classification rather than deferring the charge off of confirmed losses until they are realized 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease of  or  was a result of management s decision that less of a provision for loan losses was needed for the level of inherent risk in its portfolio as of december  as compared to december  bancorp s total loan portfolio has decreased from in addition  bancorp has experienced a modest decrease in loan delinquencies  which contributed to the decision to reduce the provision for loan losses from management believes that bancorp will continue to experience improvement in the challenges faced by many financial institutions resulting from the slowdown in the economy and real estate markets 
other income and non interest expenses 
total other income increased  or  to  for compared to  for revenues from mortgage banking activities increased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of the market conditions which affected our ability to originate loans to be sold in the secondary market

net interest income 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in bancorp s loan volume 
bancorp s interest rate spread decreased by to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of interest rates earned on bancorp s loan portfolio decreasing faster than the decrease in interest rates paid on bancorp s interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  bancorp s non accrual loans decreased from  at december  to  at december  this resulted in  of interest income not recorded on non accrual loans in  compared to  of unrecorded interest in provision for loan losses 
the total allowance for loan losses decreased  or  to  as of december   compared to  as of december  the decrease in the allowance was due to a decrease in loans receivable  an improvement in loan delinquencies and non accrual loans offset in part by an increase in impaired loans primarily due to a slowdown in foreclosed loans transferred to foreclosed real estate

liquidity and capital resources in  bancorp s sources of liquidity were loan repayments  maturing investments  deposits  borrowed funds  and the sale of loans 
bancorp considers core deposits stable funding sources and includes all deposits  except time deposits of  or more 
at december   core deposits equaled of total deposits 
the bank s experience has been that a substantial portion of certificates of deposit renew at time of maturity and remain on deposit with the bank 
additionally  loan payments  maturities  deposit growth and earnings contributed to bancorp s flow of funds 
in addition to its ability to generate deposits  bancorp has external sources of funds  which may be drawn upon when desired 
the primary source of external liquidity is an available line of credit with the fhlb atlanta 
the bank s credit availability under the fhlb of atlanta s credit availability program was  at december   of which  was outstanding 
the bank is able to borrow up to of total assets 
the maturities of these long term advances at december  were as follows dollars in thousands rate amount maturity to to to thereafter as of december   bancorp had outstanding an aggregate of  principal amount of subordinated debt  consisting of the debentures and the subordinated notes 
the debentures total  pay interest quarterly at a floating rate of interest of month libor december  plus basis points  and mature on january  the subordinated notes total  and pay interest at an annual rate of  payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of march  june  september and december commencing december  the subordinated notes are redeemable in whole or in part at the option of bancorp at any time beginning on december  until maturity  which is december  as of december   bancorp had  outstanding in loan commitments  and unadvanced construction commitments of  which bancorp expects to fund from the sources of liquidity described above 
these amounts do not include undisbursed lines of credit  home equity lines of credit and standby letters of credit  in the aggregate amount of  at december   which bancorp anticipates it will be able to fund  if required  from these liquidity sources in the regular course of business 
in addition to the foregoing  the payment of dividends is a use of cash  but is not expected to have a material effect on liquidity 
as of december   bancorp had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possible additional discretionary  actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
management believes  as of december   that the bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
we anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal will be from loan repayments  maturing investments  deposits  borrowed funds  and the sale of loans 
we believe that these sources of liquidity will be enough for bancorp to meet its liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
cash generated from these liquidity sources may be affected by a number of factors 
see risk factors for a discussion of the factors that can negatively impact the amount of cash we could receive

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative information about market risk 
the principal objective of bancorp s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risks appropriate given bancorp s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with bancorp s interest rate risk management policy 
through this management  bancorp seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors of bancorp is responsible for reviewing assets liability policies and interest rate risk position 
the board of directors reviews the interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis and  in connection with this review  evaluates bancorp s business activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on bancorp s net interest margin and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on bancorp s loan portfolio 
while continuous movement of interest rates is certain  the extent and timing of these movements is not always predictable 
any movement in interest rates has an effect on bancorp s profitability 
bancorp faces the risk that rising interest rates could cause the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  to rise faster than the yield on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments 
bancorp s interest rate spread and interest rate margin may be negatively impacted in a declining interest rate environment even though bancorp generally borrows at short term interest rates and lends at longer term interest rates 
this is because loans and other interest earning assets may be prepaid and replaced with lower yielding assets before the supporting interest bearing liabilities reprice downward 
bancorp s interest rate margin may also be negatively impacted in a flat or inverse yield curve environment 
mortgage origination activity tends to increase when interest rates trend lower and decrease when interest rates rise 
bancorp s primary strategy to control interest rate risk is to sell substantially all long term fixed rate loans in the secondary market 
to further control interest rate risk related to its loan portfolio  bancorp originates construction loans that typically have terms of one year or less 
the turnover in construction loan portfolio assists bancorp in maintaining a reasonable level of interest rate risk 
quantitative information about market risk 
the primary market risk facing bancorp is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise prospective  bancorp manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination activities with the interest rate market 
bancorp attempts to maintain a substantial portion of its loan portfolio in short term loans such as construction loans 
this has proven to be an effective hedge against rapid increases in interest rates as the construction loan portfolio reprices rapidly 
the matching of maturity or repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which these assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an interest earning asset or interest bearing liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities represents the bank s interest sensitivity gap 
exposure to interest rate risk is actively monitored by bancorp s management 
its objective is to maintain a consistent level of profitability within acceptable risk tolerances across a broad range of potential interest rate environments 
bancorp uses the bankersgps model to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk  which calculates changes in the economic value of equity eve 
the following table represents bancorp s eve at december  the eve was calculated based upon information provided to the occ 
economic value of equity eve economic value of equity change in rates amount change change bp   bp   bp   bp   bp  bp   bp   bp   bp   the above table suggests that if interest rates rise bps  bancorp s market value of equity would increase in value by
