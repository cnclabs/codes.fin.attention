part i item business 
general acadia realty trust the trust was formed on march  as a maryland real estate investment trust reit 
all references to acadia  we  us  our  and company refer to the trust and its consolidated subsidiaries 
we are a fully integrated reit focused on the ownership  acquisition  redevelopment  and management of high quality retail properties and urban infill mixed use properties with a strong retail component located primarily in high barrier to entry  supply constrained  densely populated metropolitan areas in the united states along the east coast and in chicago 
we currently own  or have an ownership interest in these properties through our core portfolio as defined in item of this form k and our opportunity funds as defined in item of this form k 
we also have private equity investments in other retail real estate related opportunities in which we have a minority equity interest 
all of our assets are held by  and all of our operations are conducted through  acadia realty limited partnership the operating partnership and entities in which the operating partnership owns an interest 
as of december   the trust controlled of the operating partnership as the sole general partner 
as the general partner  the trust is entitled to share  in proportion to its percentage interest  in the cash distributions and profits and losses of the operating partnership 
the limited partners primarily represent entities or individuals that contributed their interests in certain properties or entities to the operating partnership in exchange for common or preferred units of limited partnership interest common op units or preferred op units  respectively  and collectively  op units and employees who have been awarded restricted common op units ltip units as long term incentive compensation 
limited partners holding common op and ltip units are generally entitled to exchange their units on a one for one basis for our common shares of beneficial interest of the trust common shares 
this structure is referred to as an umbrella partnership reit  or upreit 
business objectives and strategies our primary business objective is to acquire and manage commercial retail properties that will provide cash for distributions to shareholders while also creating the potential for capital appreciation to enhance investor returns 
we focus on the following fundamentals to achieve this objective own and operate a core portfolio of high quality retail properties located primarily in high barrier to entry  densely populated metropolitan areas 
our goal is to create value through accretive redevelopment and re anchoring activities within our existing portfolio and grow this platform through the acquisition of high quality assets that have the long term potential to outperform the asset class 
generate additional external growth through an opportunistic yet disciplined acquisition program within our opportunity funds as defined below 
we target transactions with high inherent opportunity for the creation of additional value through value add investments in high quality urban and or street retail properties with re tenanting or repositioning opportunities  opportunistic acquisitions of well located real estate anchored by distressed retailers or by motivated sellers and opportunistic purchases of debt which may include restructuring 
these may also include joint ventures with private equity investors for the purpose of making investments in operating retailers with significant embedded value in their real estate assets 
maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet through conservative financial practices while ensuring access to sufficient capital to fund future growth 
investment strategy generate external growth through our dual platforms  core portfolio and opportunity funds the requirements that acquisitions be accretive on a long term basis based on our cost of capital  as well as increase the overall core portfolio quality and value  are key strategic considerations to the growth of our core portfolio 
as such  we constantly evaluate the blended cost of equity and debt and adjust the amount of acquisition activity to align the level of investment activity with capital flows 
given the growing importance of technology and e commerce  many of our retail tenants are appropriately focused on multi channel sales and how to best utilize e commerce initiatives to drive sales at their stores 
in light of these initiatives  we have found retailers are becoming more selective as to the location  size and format of their next generation stores and are focused on dense  high traffic retail corridors  where they can utilize smaller and more productive formats closer to their shopping population 
in addition to retailer multi channeling initiatives  we also believe that retailers continue to recognize that many of the nation s urban markets are under served from a retail standpoint  and we have capitalized on this situation by investing in redevelopment projects in dense urban areas where retail tenant demand has effectively surpassed the supply of available sites 
accordingly  our focus for core portfolio and opportunity fund acquisitions is on those properties which we believe will not only remain relevant to our tenants  but become even more so in the future 
in connection with our core portfolio acquisition activity  we may also engage in discussions with public and private entities regarding business combinations 
in addition to our core portfolio investments in real estate assets  we have also capitalized on our expertise in the acquisition  redevelopment  leasing and management of retail real estate by establishing discretionary opportunity funds 
our opportunity fund platform is an investment vehicle where the operating partnership invests  along with outside institutional investors  including  but not limited to  endowments  foundations  pension funds  and investment management companies  in primarily opportunistic and value add retail real estate 
to date  we have launched four opportunity funds opportunity funds  acadia strategic opportunity fund  lp fund i  acadia strategic opportunity fund ii  llc fund ii  acadia strategic opportunity fund iii llc fund iii and acadia strategic opportunity fund iv llc fund iv 
due to the level of our control  we consolidate these opportunity funds for financial reporting purposes 
the opportunity funds also include investments in operating companies through acadia mervyn investors i  llc mervyns i  acadia mervyn investors ii  llc mervyns ii and fund ii  all on a non recourse basis 
these investments comprise and are referred to as the company retailer controlled property initiative rcp venture 
the operating partnership is the sole general partner or managing member of the opportunity funds and earns fees or priority distributions for asset management  property management  construction  redevelopment  leasing and legal services 
cash flows from the opportunity funds are distributed pro rata to their respective partners and members including the operating partnership until each receives a certain cumulative return preferred return  and the return of all capital contributions 
thereafter  remaining cash flow is distributed to the operating partnership promote and to the partners or members including the operating partnership 
reference is made to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which begin on page f of this form k notes to consolidated financial statements  for a detailed discussion of the opportunity funds and rcp venture 
capital strategy balance sheet focus and access to capital our primary capital objective is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet through conservative financial practices  including a moderate use of leverage  while ensuring access to sufficient capital to fund future growth 
we intend to continue financing acquisitions and property redevelopment with sources of capital determined by management to be the most appropriate based on  among other factors  availability in the current capital markets  pricing and other commercial and financial terms 
the sources of capital may include the issuance of public equity  unsecured debt  mortgage and construction loans  and other capital alternatives including the issuance of op units 
we manage our interest rate risk primarily through the use of fixed rate debt and  where we use variable rate debt  we use certain derivative instruments  including london interbank offered rate libor swap agreements and interest rate caps as discussed further in item a 
of this form k 
during january  we established an at the market atm equity program with an aggregate offering of up to million of gross proceeds from the sale of common shares 
under this program  we issued approximately million common shares which generated net proceeds of million 
during august  we established a new atm equity program with an additional aggregate offering of up to million of gross proceeds from the sale of common shares 
through december   we issued approximately million common shares which generated net proceeds of million 
we intend to use the future net proceeds of this or potential future atm offerings primarily to fund acquisitions directly in the core portfolio and through its capital contributions to the opportunity funds 
during october  we issued approximately million common shares in a separate follow on offering  for million 
net proceeds after expenses were approximately million 
the proceeds were primarily used for acquisitions  including our pro rata share of acquisitions in fund iv and for general corporate purposes 
during january  we closed on a new unsecured revolving credit facility of up to million  which matures on january  with an additional one year extension option 
as of february   no proceeds have been drawn on this facility 
operating strategy experienced management team with proven track record our senior management team has decades of experience in the real estate industry 
we have capitalized on our expertise in the acquisition  redevelopment  leasing and management of retail real estate by creating value through property redevelopment  re anchoring and establishing joint ventures  such as the opportunity funds  in which we earn  in addition to a return on our equity interest  promotes  fees and priority distributions 
operating functions such as leasing  property management  construction  finance and legal collectively  the operating departments are generally provided by our personnel  providing for a vertically integrated operating platform 
by incorporating the operating departments in the acquisition process  acquisitions are appropriately priced giving effect to each asset s specific risks and returns and transition time is minimized allowing management to immediately execute on its strategic plan for each asset 
our core portfolio consists primarily of urban street retail properties and neighborhood and community shopping centers located in high barrier to entry supply constrained markets 
as we typically hold our core portfolio properties for long term investment  we periodically review the existing portfolio and implement programs to renovate and modernize targeted properties to enhance their market position 
this in turn strengthens the competitive position of the leasing program to attract and retain quality tenants  increasing cash flow  and consequently  property values 
from time to time  we also identify certain properties for disposition and redeploy the capital for acquisitions and for the repositioning of existing centers with greater potential for capital appreciation 
investing activities core portfolio see item properties for the definition of our core portfolio 
for the year ended december   we continued to execute on our strategy of owning a superior core portfolio by acquiring  through our operating partnership  high quality  street urban and suburban retail assets located in densely populated areas for an aggregate purchase price of million

in addition  as of december  we have a current acquisition pipeline of million under contract  which is subject to certain closing conditions and as such  no assurance can be given that closing will be successfully completed

completion of the construction of this project is anticipated to be during rcp venture during  through funds i and ii  or affiliates thereof  we entered into an association  known as the rcp venture  with klaff realty  lp klaff and lubert adler management  inc lubert adler for the purpose of making investments in surplus or underutilized properties owned by retailers 
mervyns i and ii along with fund ii have invested a total of million in the rcp venture to date on a non recourse basis 
reference is made to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a detailed discussion of the rcp venture 
while we are primarily a passive partner in the investments made through the rcp venture  historically we have provided our services in reviewing potential acquisitions and operating and redevelopment assistance in areas where we have both a presence and expertise 
in the future  we may seek to opportunistically invest either on our own  with the rcp venture or with other partners in similar investments  which may include investment in operating retailers to control their real estate through private equity joint ventures collaboration with financially healthy retailers to create value from their surplus real estate investment in properties  designation rights or other control of real estate or leases associated with retailers in bankruptcy completion of sale leasebacks with retailers in need of capital mervyns department stores in september  we made our first rcp venture investment 
through mervyns i and mervyns ii  we invested in a consortium to acquire mervyns consisting of stores realco and its retail operation opco from target corporation 
to date  realco has disposed of a significant portion of the portfolio 
in addition  during november  we sold our interest in  and as a result  have no further investment in opco 
during  a legal proceeding relating to the disposition of opco was settled 
reference is made to item part of this form k for a detailed description of this settlement 
through december   we  through mervyns i and mervyns ii  made additional investments in locations that are separate from these original investments add on investments in mervyns

competition there are numerous entities that compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and tenants that will lease space in our properties 
our competitors include other reits  financial institutions  insurance companies  pension funds  private companies and individuals

item a 
risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition would likely suffer 
this section includes or refers to certain forward looking statements 
refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward looking statements discussed in the beginning of this form k 
we rely on revenues derived from major tenants 
we derive significant revenues from certain anchor tenants that occupy space in more than one center 
we could be adversely affected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of  or a downturn in the business of  any of our major tenants  or in the event that any such tenant does not renew its leases as they expire or renews such leases at lower rental rates 
vacated anchor space not only would reduce rental revenues  but if not re tenanted at the same rental rates could adversely affect the entire shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant customer drawing power 
loss of customer drawing power also can occur through the exercise of the right  that most anchors have  to vacate and prevent re tenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term going dark as would the departure of a shadow anchor tenant that owns its own property 
in addition  in the event that certain major tenants cease to occupy a property  such an action may result in a significant number of other tenants having the right to terminate their leases  or pay a reduced rent based on a percentage of the tenant sales  at the affected property  which could adversely affect the future income from such property co tenancy 
see item properties major tenants in this annual report on form k for quantified information with respect to the percentage of our minimum rents received from major tenants 
we may not be able to renew current leases and the terms of re letting including the cost of concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 
upon the expiration of current leases for space located in our properties  we may not be able to re let all or a portion of that space  or the terms of re letting including the cost of concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 
if we are unable to re let promptly all or a substantial portion of the space located in our properties or if the rental rates we receive upon re letting are significantly lower than current rates  our net income and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected due to the resulting reduction in revenues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain tenants in any of our properties upon the expiration of their leases 
see item properties lease expirations in this annual report on form k for additional information as to the scheduled lease expirations in our portfolio 
the bankruptcy of  or a downturn in the business of  any of our major tenants or a significant number of our smaller tenants may adversely affect our cash flows and property values 
the bankruptcy of  or a downturn in the business of  any of our major tenants causing them to reject their leases  or not renew their leases as they expire  or renew at lower rental rates  may adversely affect our cash flows and property values 
furthermore  the impact of vacated anchor space and the potential reduction in customer traffic may adversely impact the balance of tenants at a shopping center 
historically and from time to time  certain of our tenants experienced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code chapter bankruptcy 
pursuant to bankruptcy law  tenants have the right to reject their leases 
in the event the tenant exercises this right  the landlord generally has the right to file a claim for lost rent equal to the greater of either one year rent including tenant expense reimbursements for remaining terms greater than one year  or of the rent remaining under the balance of the lease term  but not to exceed three years rent 
actual amounts to be received in satisfaction of those claims will be subject to the tenant final plan of reorganization and the availability of funds to pay its creditors 
although currently none of our critical tenants are in bankruptcy  experience shows that there can be no assurance that one or more of our major tenants will be immune from bankruptcy 
internet sales can have an impact on our business 
the use of the internet by consumers continues to gain in popularity 
the migration toward internet sales is likely to continue 
this increase in internet sales could result in a downturn in the business of our current tenants and could affect the way future tenants lease space 
while we devote considerable effort and resources to analyze and respond to tenant trends  preferences and consumer spending patterns  we cannot predict with certainty what future tenants will want  what future retail spaces will look like and how much revenue will be generated at traditional bricks and mortar locations 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond promptly to trends in the market due to the illiquid nature of real estate see the risk factor entitled  our ability to change our portfolio is limited because real estate investments are illiquid below  our occupancy levels and financial results could suffer 
the current economic environment  while improving  may cause us to lose tenants and may impair our ability to borrow money to purchase properties  refinance existing debt or finance our current redevelopment projects 
our operations and performance depend on general economic conditions  including the health of the consumer 
the us economy recently experienced financial downturn  included a decline in consumer spending  credit tightening and high unemployment 
the current economic environment also had  and continues to have  an impact on the global credit markets 
while we currently believe we have adequate sources of liquidity  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain mortgage loans to purchase additional properties  obtain financing to complete current redevelopment projects  or successfully refinance our properties as loans become due 
to the extent that the availability of credit is limited  it would also adversely impact our notes receivable as counterparties may not be able to obtain the financing required to repay the loans upon maturity 
political and economic uncertainty could have an adverse effect on us 
we cannot predict how current political and economic uncertainty  including uncertainty related to taxation  will affect our critical tenants  joint venture partners  lenders  financial institutions and general economic conditions  including the health and confidence of the consumer and the volatility of the stock market 
political and economic uncertainty poses a risk to the company in that it may cause consumers to postpone discretionary spending in response to tighter credit  reduced consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior  resulting in a downturn in the business of our tenants 
in the event current political and economic uncertainty results in financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or significant financial service institution failures  there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets  low liquidity  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
each of these could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
there are risks relating to investments in real estate 
real property investments are subject to multiple risks 
real estate values are affected by a number of factors  including changes in the general economic climate  local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area  the quality and philosophy of management  competition from other available space  the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and to control variable operating costs 
shopping centers  in particular  may be affected by changing perceptions of retailers or shoppers regarding the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center and by the overall climate for the retail industry 
real estate values are also affected by such factors as government regulations  interest rate levels  the availability of financing and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning  tax and other laws 
a significant portion of our income is derived from rental income from real property 
our income and cash flow would be adversely affected if we were unable to rent our vacant space to viable tenants on economically favorable terms 
in the event of default by a tenant  we may experience delays in enforcing  as well as incur substantial costs to enforce  our rights as a landlord 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced even though there may be a reduction in income from the investment 
our ability to change our portfolio is limited because real estate investments are illiquid 
equity investments in real estate are relatively illiquid and  therefore  our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changed conditions is limited 
our board of trustees may establish investment criteria or limitations as it deems appropriate  but currently does not limit the number of properties in which we may seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one geographic region 
we could change our investment  disposition and financing policies without a vote of our shareholders 
we could become highly leveraged  resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions 
in addition  the viability of the interest rate hedges we use is subject to the strength of the counterparties 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  indebtedness to support our activities 
neither our declaration of trust nor any policy statement formally adopted by our board of trustees limits either the total amount of indebtedness or the specified percentage of indebtedness that we may incur 
accordingly  we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions 
interest expense on our variable rate debt as of december  would increase by million annually for a basis point increase in interest rates 
we may seek additional variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  we would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable rate debt  primarily through interest rate swaps but can use other means 
we enter into interest rate hedging transactions  including interest rate swaps and cap agreements  with counterparties  generally  the same lenders who made the loan in question 
there can be no guarantee that the future financial condition of these counterparties will enable them to fulfill their obligations under these agreements 
competition may adversely affect our ability to purchase properties and to attract and retain tenants 
there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies  financial institutions and other investors with greater financial resources than we have that compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and tenants who will lease space in our properties 
our competitors include other reits  financial institutions  insurance companies  pension funds  private companies and individuals 
this competition may result in a higher cost for properties than we wish to pay 
in addition  retailers at our properties both in our core portfolio and in the portfolios of the opportunity funds face increasing competition from outlet malls  discount shopping clubs  internet commerce  direct mail and telemarketing  which could i reduce rents payable to us and ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties leading to increased vacancy rates at our properties 
we could be adversely affected by poor market conditions where our properties are geographically concentrated 
our performance depends on the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated 
we have significant exposure to the greater new york region  from which we derive of the annual base rents within our core portfolio and of annual base rents within our opportunity funds 
our operating results could be adversely affected if market conditions  such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate  in this area occurs 
we have pursued  and may in the future continue to pursue extensive growth opportunities  which may result in significant demands on our operational  administrative and financial resources 
we are pursuing extensive growth opportunities 
this expansion places significant demands on our operational  administrative and financial resources 
the continued growth of our real estate portfolio can be expected to continue to place a significant strain on our resources 
our future performance will depend in part on our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified management personnel to manage the growth and operations of our business 
in addition  the acquired properties may fail to operate at expected levels due to the numerous factors that may affect the value of real estate 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to identify and manage the properties 
our inability to carry out our growth strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our earnings growth strategy is based on the acquisition and redevelopment of additional properties  including acquisitions of core properties through our operating partnership and our high return investment programs through acadia strategic opportunity fund iv llc fund iv 
the consummation of any future acquisitions will be subject to satisfactory completion of our extensive valuation analysis and due diligence review and to the negotiation of definitive documentation 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to implement our strategy because we may have difficulty finding new properties  obtaining necessary entitlements  negotiating with new or existing tenants or securing acceptable financing 
acquisitions of additional properties entail the risk that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations  including operating and leasing expectations 
in the context of our business plan  redevelopment generally means an expansion or renovation of an existing property 
redevelopment is subject to numerous risks  including risks of construction delays  cost overruns or uncontrollable events that may increase project costs  new project commencement risks such as the receipt of zoning  occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits  and incurring redevelopment costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion 
a component of our growth strategy is through private equity type investments made through our rcp venture 
these include investments in operating retailers 
the inability of the retailers to operate profitably would have an adverse impact on income realized from these investments 
through our investments in joint ventures we have also invested in operating businesses that have operational risk in addition to the risks associated with real estate investments  including among other risks  human capital issues  adequate supply of product and material  and merchandising issues 
we operate through a partnership structure  which could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our assets 
our primary property owning vehicle is the operating partnership  of which we are the general partner 
our acquisition of properties through the operating partnership in exchange for interests in the operating partnership may permit certain tax deferral advantages to limited partners who contribute properties to the operating partnership 
since properties contributed to the operating partnership may have unrealized gains attributable to the differences between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis in such properties prior to contribution  the sale of such properties could cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contributed such properties 
although we  as the general partner of the operating partnership  generally have no obligation to consider the tax consequences of our actions to any limited partner  we own several properties subject to material restrictions designed to minimize the adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contributed such properties 
such restrictions may result in significantly reduced flexibility to manage some of our assets 
exclusivity obligation to our opportunity funds 
under the terms of fund iv  our primary goal is to seek investments for fund iv  subject to certain exceptions 
we may only pursue opportunities to acquire retail properties directly through the operating partnership if i the ownership of the acquisition opportunity by fund iv would create a material conflict of interest for us  ii we require the acquisition opportunity for a like kind exchange  iii the consideration payable for the acquisition opportunity is our common shares  op units or other securities or iv the investment is outside the parameters of our investment goals for fund iv which  in general  seeks more opportunistic level returns 
as a result  we may not be able to make attractive acquisitions directly and instead may only receive a minority interest in such acquisitions through fund iv 
risks of joint ventures 
partnership or joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by us  including the possibility that our partner or co venturer might become bankrupt  and that our partner or co venturer may take action contrary to our instructions  requests  policies or objectives  including our policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a reit 
other risks of joint venture investments include impasse on decisions  such as a sale  because neither we nor a joint venture partner would have full control over the joint venture 
also  there is no limitation under our organizational documents as to the amount of our funds that may be invested in joint ventures 
additionally  our partners or co venturers may engage in malfeasance in spite of our efforts to perform a high level of due diligence on them 
such acts may or may not be covered by insurance 
finally  partners and co venturers may engage in illegal activities which may jeopardize an investment and or subject us to reputational risk 
any disputes that may arise between joint venture partners and us may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business 
consequently  actions by or disputes with joint venture partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk 
in addition  we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party joint venture partners 
during  and  our fund i and mervyns i joint ventures provided promote income 
there can be no assurance that the joint ventures will continue to operate profitably and thus provide additional promote income in the future 
these factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 
in addition  a partner or co venturer may not have access to sufficient capital to satisfy its funding obligations to the joint venture 
market factors could have an adverse effect on our share price and our ability to access the public equity markets 
one of the factors that may influence the trading price of our common shares is the annual dividend rate on our common shares as a percentage of its market price 
an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common shares to seek a higher annual dividend rate  which could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
a decline in our share price  as a result of this or other market factors  could unfavorably impact our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets 
the loss of a key executive officer could have an adverse effect on us 
our success depends on the contribution of key management members 
the loss of the services of kenneth f 
bernstein  president and chief executive officer  or other key executive level employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have obtained key man life insurance for mr 
bernstein 
in addition  we have entered into an employment agreement with mr 
bernstein  however  it can be terminated by mr 
bernstein in his discretion 
we have not entered into employment agreements with other key executive level employees 
our board of trustees may change our investment policy without shareholder approval 
our board of trustees may determine to change our investment and financing policies  our growth strategy and our debt  capitalization  distribution  acquisition  disposition and operating policies 
our board of trustees may establish investment criteria or limitations as it deems appropriate  but currently does not limit the number of properties in which we may seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one geographic region 
although our board of trustees has no present intention to revise or amend our strategies and policies  it may do so at any time without a vote by our shareholders 
accordingly  the results of decisions made by our board of trustees and implemented by management may or may not serve the interests of all of our shareholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations  including our ability to distribute cash to shareholders or qualify as a reit 
distribution requirements imposed by law limit our operating flexibility 
to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our taxable income for each calendar year 
our taxable income is determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we will incur a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of i of our ordinary income for that year  ii of our capital gain net income for that year and  iii of our undistributed taxable income from prior years 
we intend to continue to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code and to minimize exposure to federal income and nondeductible excise taxes 
differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in determining our income as well as required debt amortization payments and the capitalization of certain expenses could require us to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 
the distribution requirements also severely limit our ability to retain earnings to acquire and improve properties or retire outstanding debt 
there can be no assurance we have qualified or will remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we have consistently met the requirements for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december   and we intend to continue to meet these requirements in the future 
however  qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code  for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
no assurance can be given that we have qualified or will remain qualified as a reit 
the internal revenue code provisions and income tax regulations applicable to reits differ significantly from those applicable to other corporations 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control can potentially affect our ability to continue to qualify as a reit 
in addition  no assurance can be given that future legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements for qualification as a reit or adversely affect the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
under current law  if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our net taxable income 
in addition  our income would be subject to tax at the regular corporate rates 
we also could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be significantly reduced for each year in which we do not qualify as a reit 
in that event  we would not be required to continue to make distributions 
although we currently intend to continue to qualify as a reit  it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause us  without the consent of our shareholders  to revoke the reit election or to otherwise take action that would result in disqualification 
limits on ownership of our capital shares 
for us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  among other requirements  not more than of the value of our capital shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of each taxable year after  and such capital shares must be beneficially owned by or more persons during at least days of a taxable year of months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year in each case  other than the first such year 
our declaration of trust includes certain restrictions regarding transfers of our capital shares and ownership limits that are intended to assist us in satisfying these limitations  among other purposes 
these restrictions and limits may not be adequate in all cases  however  to prevent the transfer of our capital shares in violation of the ownership limitations 
the ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us 
actual or constructive ownership of our capital shares in excess of the share ownership limits contained in our declaration of trust would cause the violative transfer or ownership to be null and void from the beginning and subject to purchase by us at a price equal to the fair market value of such shares determined in accordance with the rules set forth in our declaration of trust 
as a result  if a violative transfer were made  the recipient of the shares would not acquire any economic or voting rights attributable to the transferred shares 
additionally  the constructive ownership rules for these limits are complex and groups of related individuals or entities may be deemed a single owner and consequently in violation of the share ownership limits 
concentration of ownership by certain investors 
as of december   seven institutional shareholders own or more individually  and in the aggregate  of our common shares 
a significant concentration of ownership may allow an investor or a group of investors to exert a greater influence over our management and affairs and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us 
restrictions on a potential change of control 
our board of trustees is authorized by our declaration of trust to establish and issue one or more series of preferred shares without shareholder approval 
we have not established any series of preferred shares 
however  the establishment and issuance of a series of preferred shares could make more difficult a change of control of us that could be in the best interests of the shareholders 
in addition  we have entered into an employment agreement with our chief executive officer and severance agreements are in place with our executives which provide that  upon the occurrence of a change in control of us and either the termination of their employment without cause as defined or their resignation for good reason as defined  those executive officers would be entitled to certain termination or severance payments made by us which may include a lump sum payment equal to defined percentages of annual salary and prior years average bonuses  paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective agreement  which could deter a change of control of us that could be in the best interests of the shareholders 
certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
under the maryland general corporation law  as amended  which we refer to as the mgcl  as applicable to reits  certain business combinations  including certain mergers  consolidations  share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and reclassifications of equity securities  between a maryland reit and any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of the trust outstanding voting shares or an affiliate or an associate  as defined in the mgcl  of the trust who  at any time within the two year period immediately prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the trust  which we refer to as an interested shareholder  or an affiliate of the interested shareholder  are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
after that five year period  any such business combination must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and approved by the affirmative vote of at least of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust and two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom  or with whose affiliate  the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder  unless  among other conditions  the trust common shareholders receive a minimum price  as defined in the mgcl  for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares 
these provisions of the mgcl do not apply  however  to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees of the trust before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder  and a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder 
in approving a transaction  our board of trustees may provide that its approval is subject to compliance  at or after the time of approval  with any terms and conditions determined by the board 
the mgcl also provides that holders of control shares of a maryland reit defined as voting shares that  when aggregated with all other shares owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is entitled to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy  would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing trustees acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding shares owned by the acquirer  by officers or by employees who are also trustees of the trust 
our bylaws provide that the control share acquisition statute shall not apply to shares acquired or owned  directly or indirectly  by any person acting in concert with any group as defined in section of the exchange act and the rules thereunder 
our bylaws can be amended by our board of trustees by majority vote  and there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 
additionally  title  subtitle of the mgcl permits our board of trustees  without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our declaration of trust or bylaws  to elect to be subject to certain provisions relating to corporate governance that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of our common shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders 
we are subject to some of these provisions for example  a two thirds vote requirement for removing a trustee by provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws unrelated to subtitle becoming subject to  or the potential to become subject to  these provisions of the mgcl could inhibit  delay or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our shareholders or otherwise be in our or their best interests 
in addition  the provisions of our declaration of trust on removal of trustees and the provisions of our bylaws regarding advance notice of shareholder nominations of trustees and other business proposals and restricting shareholder action outside of a shareholders meeting unless such action is taken by unanimous written consent could have a similar effect 
our rights and shareholders rights to take action against trustees and officers are limited  which could limit recourse in the event of actions not in the best interests of shareholders 
as permitted by maryland law  our declaration of trust eliminates the liability of our trustees and officers to the company and its shareholders for money damages  except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the trustee or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated 
in addition  our declaration of trust authorizes  and our bylaws obligate  us to indemnify each present or former trustee or officer  to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law  who is made a party to any proceeding because of his or her service to our company 
as part of these indemnification obligations  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our trustees and officers 
legislative or regulatory tax changes could have an adverse effect on us 
there are a number of issues associated with an investment in a reit that are related to the federal income tax laws  including  but not limited to  the consequences of our failing to continue to qualify as a reit 
at any time  the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended or modified 
any new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect us or our shareholders 
reduced tax rates applicable to certain corporate dividends paid to most domestic noncorporate shareholders are not generally available to reit shareholders since a reits income generally is not subject to corporate level tax 
as a result  investment in non reit corporations may be viewed as relatively more attractive than investment in reits by domestic noncorporate investors 
this could adversely affect the market price of our shares 
our redevelopment and construction activities could affect our operating results 
we intend to continue the selective redevelopment and construction of retail properties  with our project at citypoint currently being our largest redevelopment project see item business investing activities opportunity funds redevelopment activities for a description of the citypoint project 
as opportunities arise  we expect to delay construction until sufficient pre leasing is reached and financing is in place 
our redevelopment and construction activities include risks that we may abandon redevelopment opportunities after expending resources to determine feasibility  construction costs of a project may exceed our original estimates  occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  financing for redevelopment of a property may not be available to us on favorable terms  we may not complete construction and lease up on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs  and we may not be able to obtain  or may experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
additionally  the time frame required for redevelopment  construction and lease up of these properties means that we may not realize a significant cash return for several years 
if any of the above events occur  the redevelopment of properties may hinder our growth and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  new redevelopment activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  typically require substantial time and attention from management 
redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 
our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of shopping centers and other retail properties in supply constrained markets in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to entry 
the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected  either temporarily or for extended periods  we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify  we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully  properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project  within the time frames we project  at the time we make the decision to invest  which may result in the properties failure to achieve the returns we projected  our pre acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired  which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property  and our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition  and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property  may fail to reveal various liabilities  which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost 
climate change and catastrophic risk from natural perils 
some of our current properties could be subject to potential natural or other disasters 
we may acquire properties that are located in areas which are subject to natural disasters 
any properties located in coastal regions would therefore be affected by any future increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes and tropical storms  whether such increases are caused by global climate changes or other factors 
climate change is a long term change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods of time that range from decades to millions of years 
it may be a change in the average weather conditions or a change in the distribution of weather events with respect to an average  for example  greater or fewer extreme weather events 
climate change may be limited to a specific region  or may occur across the whole earth 
there may be significant physical effects of climate change that have the potential to have a material effect on our business and operations 
these effects can impact our personnel  physical assets  tenants and overall operations 
physical impacts of climate change may include increased storm intensity and severity of weather eg  floods or hurricanes  sea level rise  and extreme temperatures 
as a result of these physical impacts from climate related events  we may be vulnerable to the following risks of property damage to our shopping centers  indirect financial and operational impacts from disruptions to the operations of major tenants located in our shopping centers from severe weather  such as hurricanes or floods  increased insurance premiums and deductibles  or a decrease in the availability of coverage  for properties in areas subject to severe weather  increased insurance claims and liabilities  increases in energy costs impacting operational returns  changes in the availability or quality of water  or other natural resources on which the tenant business depends  decreased consumer demand for consumer products or services resulting from physical changes associated with climate change eg  warmer temperatures or decreasing shoreline could reduce demand for residential and commercial properties previously viewed as desirable  incorrect long term valuation of an equity investment due to changing conditions not previously anticipated at the time of the investment  and economic disruptions arising from the above 
possible liability relating to environmental matters 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations  as an owner of real property  we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  in or under our property  as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
these laws may impose liability without regard to whether  we knew of or were responsible for  the presence or disposal of those substances 
this liability may be imposed on us in connection with the activities of an operator of  or tenant at  the property 
the cost of any required remediation  removal  fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and or our aggregate assets 
in addition  the presence of those substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remove those substances  may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow using that property as collateral  which  in turn  could reduce our revenues and affect our ability to make distributions 
a property can also be adversely affected either through physical contamination or by virtue of an adverse effect upon value attributable to the migration of hazardous or toxic substances  or other contaminants that have or may have emanated from other properties 
although our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased premises  in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy any obligations with respect to the property leased to that tenant  we may be required to satisfy such obligations 
in addition  we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease 
from time to time  in connection with the conduct of our business  and prior to the acquisition of any property from a third party or as required by our financing sources  we authorize the preparation of phase i environmental reports and  when necessary  phase ii environmental reports  with respect to our properties 
based upon these environmental reports and our ongoing review of our properties  we are currently not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that the environmental reports will reveal all environmental conditions at our properties or that the following will not expose us to material liability in the future the discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions  changes in law  activities of tenants  and activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of our tenants  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
uninsured losses or a loss in excess of insured limits could adversely affect our financial condition 
we carry comprehensive general liability  all risk property  extended coverage  loss of rent insurance  and environmental liability on our properties  with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
however  with respect to those properties where the leases do not provide for abatement of rent under any circumstances  we generally do not maintain loss of rent insurance 
in addition  there are certain types of losses  such as losses resulting from wars  terrorism or acts of god that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose capital invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss of these types would adversely affect our financial condition 
future terrorist attacks or civil unrest could harm the demand for  and the value of  our properties 
future terrorist attacks or civil unrest  such as the attacks that occurred in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   and other acts of terrorism or war  could harm the demand for  and the value of  our properties 
terrorist attacks could directly impact the value of our properties through damage  destruction  loss or increased security costs  and the availability of insurance for such acts may be limited or may be subject to substantial cost increases 
to the extent that our tenants are impacted by future attacks  their ability to continue to honor obligations under their existing leases could be adversely affected 
a decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re lease our properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates 
these acts might erode business and consumer confidence and spending  and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies 
any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate  decrease or delay the occupancy of our properties  and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital 
outages  computer viruses and similar events could disrupt our operations 
we rely on information technology networks and systems  some of which are owned and operated by third parties  to process  transmit and store electronic information 
any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  terrorist attacks and similar events 
despite the implementation of network security measures  our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses and similar disruptions 
if we and the third parties on whom we rely are unable to prevent such outages and breaches  our operations could be disrupted 
increased information technology it security threats and more sophisticated computer crime could pose a risk to our systems  networks and services 
increased global it security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality  availability and integrity of our data 
the open nature of interconnected technologies may allow for a network or web outage or a privacy breach that reveals sensitive data or transmission of harmful malicious code to business partners and clients resulting in liability claims 
while we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures  including a dedicated it team  employee training and background checks  comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems  and maintenance of backup systems and redundancy along with purchasing available insurance coverage  our systems  networks and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced threats 
depending on their nature and scope  such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information  improper use of our systems and networks  manipulation and destruction of data  loss of trade secrets  system downtimes and operational disruptions  which in turn could adversely affect our reputation  competitiveness and results of operations

item properties 
shopping center properties the discussion and tables in this item include properties held through our core portfolio and our opportunity funds 
we define our core portfolio as those properties either owned by  or partially owned through joint venture interests by  the operating partnership  or subsidiaries thereof  not including those properties owned through our opportunity funds 
as of december   there are operating properties in our core portfolio totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
the core portfolio properties are located in states and the district of columbia and primarily consist of urban street retail  dense suburban neighborhood and community shopping centers and mixed use properties with a strong retail component 
our shopping centers are predominately anchored by supermarkets or value oriented retail 
the properties are diverse in size  ranging from approximately  to  square feet and as of december   were  in total  occupied 
as of december   we owned and operated properties totaling approximately million square feet of gla in our opportunity funds  excluding eight properties under redevelopment 
in addition to shopping centers  the opportunity funds have invested in mixed use properties  which generally include retail activities 
the opportunity fund properties are located in eight states and the district of columbia and as of december   were  in total  occupied 
within our core portfolio and opportunity funds  we had approximately leases as of december  a majority of our rental revenues were from national retailers and consist of rents received under long term leases 
these leases generally provide for the monthly payment of fixed minimum rent and the tenants pro rata share of the real estate taxes  insurance  utilities and common area maintenance of the shopping centers 
certain of our leases also provide for the payment of rent based on a percentage of a tenant gross sales in excess of a stipulated annual amount  either in addition to  or in place of  minimum rents 
minimum rents  percentage rents and expense reimbursements accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  three of our core portfolio properties and five of our opportunity fund properties are subject to long term ground leases in which a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us 
we pay rent for the use of the land and are responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements at all eight locations 
no individual property contributed in excess of of our total revenues for the years ended december   or reference is made to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for information on the mortgage debt pertaining to our properties

we are involved in various matters of litigation arising in the normal course of business 
while we are unable to predict with any certainty the amounts involved  management is of the opinion that  when such litigation is resolved  our resulting exposure to loss contingencies  if any  will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
in addition to the foregoing  we recently settled or are currently involved in the following litigation matters in september  the company  certain of its subsidiaries  and other unrelated entities the investor consortium were named as defendants in an adversary proceeding brought by mervyn llc mervyns in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
the action involved five claims alleging fraudulent transfers in which mervyns was nominally seeking approximately billion in damages from the investor consortium  although the actual claims made by the administrator and the unsecured creditors were substantially less 
the first claim contended that  at the time of the sale of mervyns by target corporation target to the investor consortium  a transfer of assets was made in an effort to defraud creditors 
the company believed that this aspect of the case is without merit 
the remaining four claims related to transfers of assets of mervyns at various times after the sale by target 
the company believed that there were substantial defenses to these claims 
during the third quarter of  the parties to this litigation arrived at an agreement to settle the claim 
the settlement was approved by the bankruptcy court and provided for a payment of million 
based on the defendants agreement  the net cost of the settlement to the investor consortium amounted to approximately million 
after applying cash on hand at the investee level  mervyns i and mervyns ii combined contribution to this settlement was approximately million 
in addition  the company reduced its carrying value of these investments from million to its fair value of million in relation to the estimated value of the remaining assets 
in total  this resulted in a charge of million during the year ended december   of which the operating partnership share  net of income taxes  was million 
during august  we terminated the employment of a former senior vice president the former employee for engaging in conduct that fell within the definition of cause in his severance agreement with us 
had the former employee not been terminated for cause  he would have been eligible to receive approximately million under the severance agreement 
because we terminated him for cause  we did not pay the former employee any severance benefits under his agreement 
the former employee has brought a lawsuit against us in new york state supreme court  alleging breach of the severance agreement 
the suit is in the pre trial discovery stage 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the suit

item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview as of december   we operated properties  which we own or have an ownership interest in  within our core portfolio or within our opportunity funds 
our core portfolio consists of those properties either owned by  or partially owned through joint venture interests by the operating partnership  or subsidiaries thereof  not including those properties owned through our opportunity funds 
these properties primarily consist of urban street retail  dense suburban neighborhood and community shopping centers and mixed use properties with a strong retail component 
the properties we operate are located primarily in high barrier to entry  densely populated metropolitan areas in the united states along the east coast and in chicago 
there are properties in our core portfolio totaling approximately million square feet 
fund i has three remaining properties comprising approximately million square feet 
fund ii has six properties  four of which representing million square feet are currently operating  one is under construction  and one is in the design phase 
fund iii has properties  nine of which representing million square feet are currently operating and five of which are in the design phase 
fund iv has five properties  four of which are operating with one under design 
the majority of our operating income is derived from rental revenues from these properties  including recoveries from tenants  offset by operating and overhead expenses 
as our rcp venture invests in operating companies  we consider these investments to be private equity style  as opposed to real estate  investments 
since these are not traditional investments in operating rental real estate but investments in operating businesses  the operating partnership invests in these through a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
our primary business objective is to acquire and manage commercial retail properties that will provide cash for distributions to shareholders while also creating the potential for capital appreciation to enhance investor returns 
we focus on the following fundamentals to achieve this objective own and operate a core portfolio of high quality retail properties located primarily in high barrier to entry  densely populated metropolitan areas and create value through accretive redevelopment and re anchoring activities coupled with the acquisition of high quality assets that have the long term potential to outperform the asset class as part of our core asset recycling and acquisition initiative 
generate additional external growth through an opportunistic yet disciplined acquisition program through our opportunity funds 
we target transactions with high inherent opportunity for the creation of additional value through value add investments in high quality urban and or street retail properties with re tenanting or repositioning opportunities  opportunistic acquisitions of well located real estate anchored by distressed retailers or by motivated sellers and opportunistic purchases of debt which may include restructuring 
these may also include joint ventures with private equity investors for the purpose of making investments in operating retailers with significant embedded value in their real estate assets 
maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet through conservative financial practices while ensuring access to sufficient capital to fund future growth

core portfolio the following discussion of net property operating income noi and rent spreads on new and renewal leases includes the activity from both our consolidated and our pro rata share of unconsolidated properties within our core portfolio 
our opportunity funds invest primarily in properties that typically require significant leasing and redevelopment 
given that the opportunity funds are finite life investment vehicles  these properties are sold following stabilization 
for these reasons  we believe noi and rent spreads are not meaningful measures for our opportunity fund investments 
noi represents property revenues less property expenses 
we consider noi and rent spreads on new and renewal leases for our core portfolio to be appropriate supplemental disclosures of portfolio operating performance due to their widespread acceptance and use within the reit investor and analyst communities

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of property held for use and sale on a quarterly basis  we review the carrying value of both properties held for use and for sale 
we perform an impairment analysis by calculating and reviewing net operating income on a property by property basis 
we evaluate leasing projections and perform other analyses to conclude whether an asset is impaired 
we record impairment losses and reduce the carrying value of properties when indicators of impairment are present and the expected undiscounted cash flows related to those properties are less than their carrying amounts 
in cases where we do not expect to recover our carrying costs on properties held for use  we reduce our carrying cost to fair value 
for properties held for sale  we reduce our carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell 
during the year ended december   we determined that the value of the granville centre owned by fund i was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss of million 
granville centre was subsequently sold during for the years ended december  and  no impairment losses on our properties were recognized 
management does not believe that the value of any properties in its portfolio was impaired as of december  investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures we periodically review our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for other than temporary declines in market value 
any decline that is not expected to be recovered in the next twelve months is considered other than temporary and an impairment charge is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
during the year ended december   we recorded a reduction in the carrying amount of our investments in mervyn of million related to the estimated value of the remaining assets 
no impairment charges related to our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures were recognized for the years ended december  and bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make payments on arrearages in billed rents  as well as the likelihood that tenants will not have the ability to make payments on unbilled rents including estimated expense recoveries 
we also maintain a reserve for straight line rent receivables 
for the years ended december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million  respectively 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
real estate real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
expenditures for acquisition  redevelopment  construction and improvement of properties  as well as significant renovations are capitalized 
interest costs are capitalized until construction is substantially complete 
construction in progress includes costs for significant property expansion and redevelopment 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over estimated useful lives of to years for buildings  the shorter of the useful life or lease term for tenant improvements and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  and identified intangibles such as above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships and acquired liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic business combinations and asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  and allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
involuntary conversion of asset we experienced significant flooding resulting in extensive damage to one of our properties during september costs related to the clean up and redevelopment were insured to a limit sufficient that we believed would allow for full restoration of the property 
loss of rents during the redevelopment were covered by business interruption insurance subject to a million deductible 
we planned to restore the improvements that were damaged by the flooding and expected that the costs of such restoration and rebuilding would be recoverable from insurance proceeds 
in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment and as a result of the above described property damage  we have recorded a write down of the asset carrying value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of approximately million 
in addition  we recorded an insurance recovery in the same amount that is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  we also provided a million provision in the consolidated statement of income for its exposure to the insurance deductible attributable to the loss of rents 
during the year ended  december  we received initial insurance proceeds of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we received additional insurance proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with these proceeds  we recognized a gain on involuntary conversion of asset of million 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases 
minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective leases  beginning when the tenant takes possession of the space 
certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the tenant 
percentage rent is recognized in the period when the tenants sales breakpoint is met 
in addition  leases typically provide for the reimbursement to us of real estate taxes  insurance and other property operating expenses 
these reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred 
we make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable related to tenant revenues 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided against certain tenant accounts receivable that are estimated to be uncollectible 
see bad debts above 
once the amount is ultimately deemed to be uncollectible  it is written off 
notes receivable real estate notes receivable investments are intended to be held to maturity and are carried at cost 
interest income from notes receivable and preferred equity investments are recognized on the effective interest method over the expected life of the loan 
under the effective interest method  interest or fees to be collected at the origination of the loan or the payoff of the loan is recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield 
allowances for real estate notes receivable are established based upon management s quarterly review of the investments 
in performing this review  management considers the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors  including the fair value of any collateral  the amount and status of any senior debt  and the prospects for the borrower 
because this determination is based upon projections of future economic events  which are inherently subjective  the amounts ultimately realized from the loans may differ materially from the carrying value at the balance sheet date 
interest income recognition is generally suspended for loans when  in the opinion of management  a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the suspended loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed 
during  we provided for a million net reserve on notes receivable as a result of a decrease in the value of the underlying collateral properties 
inflation our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if current rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of our leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information as of december  our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to our mortgage debt 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for certain quantitative details related to our mortgage debt 
currently  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   we had total mortgage and convertible notes payable of million  net of unamortized discount of million  of which million  or was fixed rate  inclusive of debt with rates fixed through the use of derivative financial instruments  and million  or  was variable rate based upon libor rates plus certain spreads 
as of december   we were a party to seven interest rate swap transactions and four interest rate caps transaction to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million and million of libor based variable rate debt  respectively 
the following table sets forth information as of december  concerning our long term debt obligations  including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity and weighted average interest rates of maturing amounts dollars in millions consolidated mortgage debt year scheduled amortization maturities total weighted average interest rate thereafter mortgage debt in unconsolidated partnerships at our pro rata share year scheduled amortization maturities total weighted average interest rate n a thereafter million of our total consolidated debt and million of our pro rata share of unconsolidated outstanding debt will become due in million of our total consolidated debt and million of our pro rata share of unconsolidated debt will become due in as we intend on refinancing some or all of such debt at the then existing market interest rates  which may be greater than the current interest rate  our interest expense would increase by approximately million annually if the interest rate on the refinanced debt increased by basis points 
after giving effect to noncontrolling interests  our share of this increase would be million 
interest expense on our variable rate debt of million  net of variable to fixed rate swap agreements currently in effect  as of december  would increase million if libor increased by basis points 
after giving effect to noncontrolling interests  our share of this increase would be million 
we may seek additional variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  we would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable rate debt through interest rate swaps and protection agreements  or other means 
based on our outstanding debt balances as of december   the fair value of our total consolidated outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million if interest rates increase by 
conversely  if interest rates decrease by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
as of december  and  we had notes receivable of million and million  respectively 
we determined the estimated fair value of our notes receivable equated the carrying values by discounting future cash receipts utilizing a discount rate equivalent to the rate at which similar notes receivable would be originated under conditions then existing 
based on our outstanding notes receivable balances as of december   the fair value of our total outstanding notes receivable would decrease by approximately million if interest rates increase by 
conversely  if interest rates decrease by  the fair value of our total outstanding notes receivable would increase by approximately million 
summarized information as of december  as of december   we had total mortgage and convertible notes payable of million of which million  or was fixed rate  inclusive of interest rate swaps  and million  or  was variable rate based upon libor plus certain spreads 
as of december   we were a party to five interest rate swap transactions and one interest rate cap transaction to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million and million of libor based variable rate debt  respectively 
we were also a party to one forward interest rate swap transaction with respect to million of libor based variable rate debt 
interest expense on our variable debt of million as of december  would have increased million if libor increased by basis points 
based on our outstanding debt balances as of december   the fair value of our total outstanding debt would have decreased by approximately million if interest rates increased by 
conversely  if interest rates decreased by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would have increased by approximately million 
changes in market risk exposures from to our interest rate risk exposure from december  to december  has decreased on both a dollar amount and as a percentage of our overall debt  as we had million in variable rate debt or of our total debt at december   as compared to million or of our total debt in variable rate debt at december
