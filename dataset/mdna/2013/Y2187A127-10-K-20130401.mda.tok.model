management of our fleet our new york city based management team  with in excess of years of experience in the shipping industry primarily focused on the sub panamax dry bulk sectors  such as supramax  handymax and handysize vessels  undertakes all commercial and strategic management of our fleet and supervises the technical management of our vessels 
the technical management of our fleet is provided internally and by unaffiliated third party managers  v 
ships limited and anglo eastern international ltd  which we believe are two of the world largest providers of independent ship management and related services 
we have also established in house technical management capability  through which we provide technical management services to several of our vessels  in order to establish a vessel management bench mark with the external technical managers 
the management of our fleet includes the following functions strategic management 
we locate  obtain financing and insurance for  purchase and sell  vessels 
commercial management 
we obtain employment for our vessels and manage our relationships with charterers 
technical management 
our unaffiliated technical managers or our in house technical manager perform day to day operations and maintenance of our vessels 
our competitive strengths and our business strategy we believe that we have a number of strengths that provide us with a competitive advantage in the dry bulk shipping industry  including a fleet of supramax dry bulk vessels 
we specialize in the supramax class of the handymax sector of the dry bulk industry 
our operating fleet of vessels at december  makes us one of the world largest fleets of vessels in the sector 
we view handymax vessels  especially the supramax class of vessels  as a highly attractive sector of the dry bulk shipping industry relative to larger vessel sectors due to their reduced volatility in charter rates  increased operating flexibility  ability to access more ports  ability to carry a more diverse range of cargoes  and broader customer base 
a modern  high quality fleet 
the handymax vessels in our operating fleet at december  had an average age of approximately six years compared to an average age for the world handymax dry bulk fleet of approximately ten years 
in  we completed our supramax vessel newbuilding program  pursuant to which we took delivery of supramax newbuilding vessels from to we believe that owning a modern  high quality fleet reduces operating costs  improves safety and provides us with a competitive advantage in securing employment for our vessels 
our fleet was built to high standards and all of our vessels were built at leading japanese and chinese shipyards  including mitsui engineering and shipbuilding co  ltd  and oshima shipbuilding co  ltd 
the newbuilding vessels were built at premier shipyards in japan  ihi marine united  and china  yangzhou dayang shipbuilding co 
ltd 
a fleet of sister and similar ships allows us to maintain low cost  highly efficient operations 
our current operating fleet of vessels includes identical sister ships built at the mitsui shipyard based upon the same design specifications  two sets of and identical sister ships built at dayang shipyard  identical sister ships built at ihi marine united shipyard  and similar ships built at the oshima shipyard that use many of the same parts and equipment 
operating sister and similar ships provides us with operational and scheduling flexibility  efficiencies in employee training and lower inventory and maintenance expenses 
we believe that this should allow us both to increase revenue and lower operating costs 
we intend to actively monitor and control vessel operating expenses while maintaining the high quality of our fleet through regular inspection and maintenance programs 
we also intend to take advantage of savings that result from the economies of scale that the third party technical managers provide us through access to bulk purchasing of supplies  quality crew members and a global service network of engineers  naval architects and port captains 
balanced charter program 
our strategy is to balance between mid term time charters and revenues generated by short term time charters and voyage charters to maximize our financial performance throughout shipping cycles 
we have entered into time and voyage charter employment contracts for all the vessels in our operating fleet 
we charter some of our vessels pursuant to one to two year time charters to allow us to take advantage of the stable cash flow and high utilization rates that are associated with medium term time charters 
the vessels that are on charters whose revenues are linked to the baltic supramax index generally have durations of one year or less 
these index linked charters and voyage charters provide us with the revenue upside as the market improves 
we believe that this structure provides significant visibility to our future financial results and allows us to take advantage of the stable cash flows and high utilization rates that are associated with medium term time charters  while at the same time providing us with the revenue upside potential from the index linked or short term time charters or voyage charters 
all the charters provide for fixed semi monthly payments in advance 
while we remain focused on securing charters with fixed base rates  we have also entered into contracts with fixed minimum rates and profit sharing arrangements  enabling us to benefit from an increasing rate environment while still minimizing downside risk 
we regularly monitor the dry bulk shipping market and based on market conditions we may consider taking advantage of long term charter rates 
expand our fleet through selective acquisitions of dry bulk vessels 
depending on market conditions  we intend to acquire additional modern  high quality vessels through timely and selective acquisitions in a manner that is accretive to our cash flows 
we expect to focus primarily in the handymax sector of the dry bulk shipping industry  and in particular on supramax class vessels 
we may also consider acquisitions of other sizes of dry bulk vessels  but not tankers 
our fleet our operating fleet of vessels are fitted with cargo cranes and cargo grabs that permit them to load and unload cargo in ports that do not have cargo handling infrastructure in place 
our vessels are flagged in the marshall islands 
we own each of our vessels through a separate wholly owned marshall islands subsidiary 
our vessels are all employed on time and voyage charters

we have entered into time and voyage charter employment contracts for all the vessels in our operating fleet 
we charter some of our vessels pursuant to one to two year time charters to allow us to take advantage of the stable cash flow and high utilization rates that are associated with medium to long term time charters 
the vessels that are on charters whose revenues are linked to the baltic supramax index generally have durations of one year or less 
these index linked charters and voyage charters will provide us with the revenue upside once the dry bulk market improves 
we believe that this structure provides significant visibility to our future financial results and allows us to take advantage of the relatively stable cash flows and high utilization rates that are associated with medium term time charters  while at the same time providing us with the revenue upside potential from the index linked or short term time charters or voyage charters 
all the charters provide for fixed semi monthly payments in advance 
while we remain focused on securing charters with fixed base rates  we have also entered into contracts with fixed minimum rates and profit sharing arrangements  enabling us to benefit from an increasing rate environment while still minimizing downside risk 
we regularly monitor the dry bulk shipping market and based on market conditions we may consider taking advantage of long term charter rates 
a time charter involves the hiring of a vessel from its owner for a period of time pursuant to a contract under which the vessel owner places its ship including its crew and equipment at the service of the charterer 
under a typical time charter  the charterer periodically pays us a fixed or an index based daily charter hire rate and bears all voyage expenses  including the cost of fuel and port and canal charges 
once we have time chartered out a vessel  trading of the vessel and the commercial risks shift to the customer 
subject to certain restrictions imposed by us in the contract  the charterer determines the type and quantity of cargo to be carried and the ports of loading and discharging 
we have established our own in house technical management capability  through which we provide technical management services to several of our and third party vessels 
we have contracted the technical operations of a portion of our vessels to third party vessel managers  and oversee the technical operation and navigation of the vessel at all times  including monitoring vessel operating expenses  such as the cost of crewing  insuring  repairing and maintaining the vessel  costs of spare parts and supplies  tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses 
in connection with the charters of each of our vessels  we pay commissions ranging from to of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter to unaffiliated ship brokers and to in house ship brokers associated with the charterers  depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the relevant charter 
our vessels operate worldwide within the trading limits imposed by our insurance terms and do not operate in areas where united states and or united nations sanctions have been imposed 
our customers our customers include international companies such as lauritzen bulkers a s  norden a s  samsung c t corporation  global maritime investments ltd  olam international  trafigura beheer bv  electroandina bv  stx pan ocean co ltd  clipper bulk shipping  korean line corporation  steel authority of india ltd  hyundai merchant marine co ltd  torm a s  seatrek trans pte ltd  and dhl project chartering china ltd 
our assessment of customers financial condition and reliability is an important factor in negotiating employment for our vessels 
we expect to charter our vessels to major trading houses including commodities traders  publicly traded companies  reputable vessel owners and operators  major producers and government owned entities rather than to more speculative or undercapitalized entities 
we evaluate the counterparty risk of potential customers based on our management experience in the shipping industry combined with the additional input of two independent credit risk consultants 
in  two customers individually accounted for more than of our time and voyage charter revenue  accounting for approximately and of our time and voyage charter revenue  respectively 
in  one customer accounted for more than of our time and voyage charter revenue  accounting for approximately of our time and voyage charter revenue 
in  two customers individually accounted for more than of our time charter revenue  accounting for approximately and of our time charter revenue  respectively 
on january   korea line corporation klc  the charterer for of our vessels filed for protective receivership in seoul  south korea 
we have temporarily taken back the employment of all affected chartered vessels and re chartered them out on the spot and short term time charter markets  pursuant to terms approved by the korean court 
earnings during this interim period were used to offset the charter hire otherwise due from klc 
on january   a comprehensive termination agreement between the company and klc became effective  pursuant to which we agreed to accept million on an installment note and  common shares of klc stock as compensation for the early termination of the charters with klc 
under the termination agreement  a payment of approximately million of the cash settlement was paid in the first quarter of  and the balance of million would have been paid in cash installments through  with the majority of the payments to be paid in the last five years 
the klc stock certificates were issued on february  and are now being secured at the korean securities depository until august   the date on which we would have been able to take possession of the share certificates 
on march   the korean court approved an amendment to klc rehabilitation plan after receiving a favorable vote from the concerned parties 
the amendment reduced our long term receivable from klc to million to be paid in cash installments through  discounted our existing shares by a to ratio  and converted the remainder of the long term receivable to shares that bring our holding of klc shares after the amendment to approximately 
we are evaluating what is the fair value of the common shares and the long term note receivable from klc and what the resulting settlement gain should be 
we have determined that the combined klc transactions will have a positive impact on our ebitda and have assessed a preliminary value of approximately million 
operations there are two central aspects to the operation of our fleet commercial operations  which involve chartering and operating a vessel  and technical operations  which involve maintaining  crewing and insuring a vessel 
we carry out the commercial and strategic management of our fleet through our wholly owned subsidiaries  eagle shipping international usa llc  a marshall islands limited liability company that was formed in january and maintains its principle executive offices in new york city  and eagle bulk pte 
ltd  a singapore company 
our office staff  either directly or through these subsidiaries  provides the following services commercial operations and technical supervision  safety monitoring  vessel acquisition  and financial  accounting and information technology services 
we currently have an aggregate of shore based personnel in our principal executive and singapore offices 
commercial and strategic management we perform all of the commercial and strategic management of our fleet that includes obtaining employment for our vessels and maintaining our relationships with our charterers 
we believe that because our management team has an average of years experience in operating handymax and handysize dry bulk vessels  we have access to a broad range of charterers and can employ the fleet efficiently in any market and achieve high utilization rates 
in accordance with our strategy  we have entered into time and voyage charters for all of our vessels currently in the operating fleet 
in general  our time charters afford us greater assurance that we will be able to cover a fixed portion of our costs  mitigate revenue volatility  provide stable cash flow and achieve higher utilization rates 
vessels coming off long term employment are being employed on the short to mid term voyage charters or on the spot market 
the company launched a freight trading operation to capitalize on value creation strategies in spot trading  contracts of affreightment  time charter in and out and derivative instruments 
these trading capabilities extend the company s global presence  which includes an office in singapore 
we regularly monitor the dry bulk shipping market and  based on market conditions  when a time charter ends  we may consider taking advantage of short term charter rates 
in such cases we will generally arrange voyage charters for those vessels that we will operate in the spot market 
under a voyage charter  the owner of a vessel provides the vessel for the transport of goods between specific ports in return for the payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo or  alternatively  a specified total amount 
all operating costs are borne by the owner of the vessel 
a single voyage charter is often referred to as a spot market charter  which generally lasts from two to ten weeks 
operating vessels in the spot market may afford greater opportunity to capitalize on fluctuations in the spot market  when vessel demand is high we earn higher rates  but when demand is low our rates are lower and potentially insufficient to cover costs 
spot market rates are volatile and are affected by world economics  international events  weather conditions  strikes  governmental policies  supply and demand  and other factors beyond our control 
if the markets are especially weak for protracted periods  there is a risk that vessels in the spot market may spend time idle waiting for business  or may have to be laid up 
identifying  purchasing  and selling vessels 
we believe that our commercial management team has longstanding relationships in the dry bulk industry  which provides us access to an extensive network of ship brokers and vessel owners that we believe will provide us with an advantage in future transactions 
obtaining insurance coverage for our vessels 
we have well established relationships with reputable marine underwriters in all the major insurance markets around the world that helps insure our fleet with insurance at competitive rates 
supervising our third party technical managers 
we regularly monitor the expenditures  crewing  and maintenance of our vessels by our technical managers  v 
ships limited and anglo eastern international ltd 
we set up our own in house technical management capability in order to establish a vessel management bench mark with our external technical managers 
our management team has direct experience with vessel operations  repairs  drydockings and vessel construction 
technical management the technical management of a portion of our fleet is provided by our unaffiliated third party technical managers  v 
ships limited and anglo eastern international ltd  that we believe are two of the world largest providers of independent ship management and related services 
we have also set up our own in house technical management capability  through which we provide technical management services to several of our vessels  in order to establish a vessel management bench mark with the external technical managers 
we review the performance of the managers on an annual basis and may add or change technical managers 
technical management includes managing day to day vessel operations  performing general vessel maintenance  ensuring regulatory and classification society compliance  supervising the maintenance and general efficiency of vessels  arranging our hire of qualified officers and crew  arranging and supervising drydocking and repairs  purchasing supplies  spare parts and new equipment for vessels  appointing supervisors and technical consultants and providing technical support 
our technical managers also manage and process all crew insurance claims 
our technical managers maintain records of all costs and expenditures incurred in connection with their services that are available for our review on a daily basis 
our technical managers are members of marine contracting associations which arrange bulk purchasing thereby enabling us to benefit from economies of scale 
we currently crew our vessels primarily with officers and seamen from india  ukraine  russia  myanmar and east european who are supplied by our managers 
as of december   we employed a total of approximately officers and seamen on the vessels in our operating fleet 
each technical manager handles each seaman training  travel  and payroll and ensures that all our seamen have the qualifications and licenses required to comply with current international regulations and shipping conventions 
additionally  our seafaring employees perform most operational and maintenance work and assist in supervising work during cargo operations and at drydock facilities 
we typically man our vessels with more crew members than are required by the country of the vessel flag in order to allow for the performance of routine maintenance duties 
all of our crew members are subject to and are paid commensurate with international collective bargaining agreements and  therefore  we do not anticipate any labor disruptions 
all international collective bargaining agreements to which we are a party are renewed for two years  prior to their expiry 
we pay our unaffiliated technical managers a monthly fee per vessel plus actual costs incurred by our vessels 
these monthly fees averaged  per vessel in   per vessel in and  per vessel in permits and authorizations we are required by various governmental and quasi governmental agencies to obtain certain permits  licenses and certificates with respect to our vessels 
the kinds of permits  licenses and certificates required depend upon several factors  including the commodity transported  the waters in which the vessel operates  the nationality of the vessel crew and the age of a vessel 
we expect to be able to obtain all permits  licenses and certificates currently required to permit our vessels to operate 
additional laws and regulations  environmental or otherwise  may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of us doing business 
environmental and other regulations government regulation significantly affects the ownership and operation of our vessels 
we are subject to international conventions and treaties  national  state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety and health and environmental protection including the storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of hazardous and non hazardous materials  and the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources 
compliance with such laws  regulations and other requirements entails significant expense  including vessel modifications and implementation of certain operating procedures 
a variety of government and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections 
these entities include the local port authorities united states coast guard  harbor master or equivalent  classification societies  flag state administrations country of registry and charterers  particularly terminal operators 
certain of these entities require us to obtain permits  licenses and certificates for the operation of our vessels 
failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend the operation of one or more of our vessels 
we believe that the heightened level of environmental and quality concerns among insurance underwriters  regulators and charterers is leading to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels and may accelerate the scrapping of older vessels throughout the dry bulk shipping industry 
increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to the stricter environmental standards 
we are required to maintain operating standards for all of our vessels that emphasize operational safety  quality maintenance  continuous training of our officers and crews and compliance with united states and international regulations 
we believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits  licenses  certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations 
however  because such laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly stricter requirements  we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements  or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels 
in addition  a future serious marine incident  such as the deepwater horizon oil spill  that causes significant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could negatively affect our profitability 
international maritime organization the united nations international maritime organization the imo has adopted several international conventions  including the international convention for the prevention of marine pollution from ships   as modified by the protocol of relating thereto collectively referred to as marpol and herein as marpol 
marpol entered into force on october  it has been adopted by over nations  including many of the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate 
marpol sets forth pollution prevention requirements applicable to drybulk carriers  among other vessels  and is broken into six annexes  each of which regulates a different source of pollution 
annex i relates to oil leakage or spilling  annexes ii and iii relate to harmful substances carried  in bulk  in liquid or packaged form  respectively  annexes iv and v relate to sewage and garbage management  respectively  and annex vi  lastly  relates to air emissions 
annex vi was separately adopted by the imo in september of  and relates to air emissions 
air emissions in september of  the imo adopted annex vi to marpol to address air pollution 
effective may  annex vi sets limits on nitrogen oxide emissions from ships whose diesel engines were constructed or underwent major conversions on or after january  it also prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances  defined to include certain halons and chlorofluorocarbons 
deliberate emissions are not limited to times when the ship is at sea  they can for example include discharges occurring in the course of the ship s repair and maintenance 
emissions of volatile organic compounds from certain tankers  and the shipboard incineration from incinerators installed after january  of certain substances such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs are also prohibited 
annex vi also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil see below 
the imo s maritime environment protection committee  or mepc  adopted amendments to annex vi on october   which amendments were entered into force on july  the amended annex vi seeks to further reduce air pollution by  among other things  implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulphur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships 
as of january   the amended annex vi requires that fuel oil contain no more than sulfur from the current cap of 
by january   sulfur content must not exceed  subject to a feasibility review to be completed no later than sulfur content standards are even stricter within certain emission control areas ecas 
as of july   ships operating within an eca may not use fuel with sulfur content in excess of from  which is further reduced to on january  amended annex vi establishes procedures for designating new ecas 
currently  the baltic sea and the north sea have been so designated 
effective august   certain coastal areas of north america will also be designated ecas  as will effective january   the united states caribbean sea 
ocean going vessels in these areas will be subject to stringent emissions controls and may cause us to incur additional costs 
if other ecas are approved by the imo or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the epa or the states where we operate  compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations 
amended annex vi also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new marine engines  depending on their date of installation 
the us environmental protection agency promulgated equivalent and in some senses stricter emissions standards in late as of january   the directive ec of the european parliament and of the council of july   amending directive ec  came into force 
the objective of the directive is to reduce emission of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter caused by the combustion of certain petroleum derived fuels 
the directive imposes limits on the sulfur content of such fuels as a condition of their use within a member state territory 
the maximum sulfur content for marine fuels used by inland waterway vessels and ships at berth in ports in eu countries after january   is by mass 
on july   the european commission also adopted a proposal for an amendment of directive ec which would align requirements with those imposed by the revised marpol annex vi which introduced stricter sulphur limits 
safety management system requirements the imo also adopted the international convention for the safety of life at sea  or solas  and the international convention on load lines  or the ll convention  which impose a variety of standards that regulate the design and operational features of ships 
the imo periodically revises the solas and ll convention standards 
the convention on limitation of liability for maritime claims llmc was recently amended and the amendments are expected to go into effect on june  the amendments alter the limits of liability for loss of life or personal injury claim and property claims against ship owners 
the operation of our ships is also affected by the requirements set forth in chapter ix of solas  which sets forth the imo international management code for the safe operation of ships and pollution prevention  or the ism code 
the ism code requires ship owners and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive safety management system that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies 
we rely upon the safety management system that we and our technical manager have developed for compliance with the ism code 
the failure of a ship owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ism code may subject such party to increased liability  may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to  or detention in  certain ports 
as of the date of this filing  all of the vessels in our operating fleet are ism code certified 
the ism code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate  or smc  for each vessel they operate 
this certificate evidences compliance by a vessel s operators with the ism code requirements for a safety management system  or sms 
no vessel can obtain an smc under the ism code unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance  or doc  issued in most instances by the vessel flag state 
our appointed ship managers have obtained documents of compliance for their offices and safety management certificates for all of our vessels for which the certificates are required by the imo  which are renewed as required 
pollution control and liability requirements the imo has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the signatories to such conventions 
for example  the imo adopted the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments  or the bwm convention  in february the bwm convention implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements  to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits 
the bwm convention will not enter into force until months after it has been adopted by states  the combined merchant fleets of which represent not less than of the gross tonnage of the world s merchant shipping tonnage 
to date  there has not been sufficient adoption of this standard for it to take force 
however  panama may adopt this standard in the relatively near future  which would be sufficient for it to take force 
upon entry into force of the bwm convention  mid ocean ballast exchange would be mandatory for our vessels 
in addition  our vessels would be required to be equipped with a ballast water treatment system that meets mandatory concentration limits not later than the first intermediate or renewal survey  whichever occurs first  after the anniversary date of delivery of the vessel in  for vessels with ballast water capacity of cubic meters  or after such date in  for vessels with ballast water capacity of greater than cubic meters 
on march   the us coast guard issued amended regulations relating to ballast water management for vessels operating in us waters  with the same phased introduction as the bmw convention for existing vessels  and mandatory for new ships from december  the costs of compliance with ballast water treatment regulations may be material 
the imo adopted the international convention on civil liability for bunker oil pollution damage  or the bunker convention  to impose strict liability on ship owners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel 
the bunker convention requires registered owners of ships over  gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the convention on limitation of liability for maritime claims of  as amended 
with respect to non ratifying states  liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ship s bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur 
in march  the imo amended annex i to marpol  including a new regulation relating to oil fuel tank protection  which became effective august  the new regulation applies to various ships delivered on or after august  it includes requirements for the protected location of the fuel tanks  performance standards for accidental oil fuel outflow  a tank capacity limit and certain other maintenance  inspection and engineering standards 
imo regulations also require owners and operators of certain vessels to adopt ship oil pollution emergency plans 
periodic training and drills for response personnel and for vessels and their crews are required 
anti fouling requirements in  the imo adopted the international convention on the control of harmful anti fouling systems on ships  or the anti fouling convention 
the anti fouling convention prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels 
vessels of over gross tons engaged in international voyages will be required to undergo an initial survey before the vessel is put into service or before an international anti fouling system certificate is issued for the first time  and subsequent surveys when the anti fouling systems are altered or replaced 
we have obtained anti fouling system certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the anti fouling convention 
the imo continues to review and introduce new regulations 
for example  in july marpol adopted amendments for the prevention of air pollution  which designate certain waters near the coasts of puerto rico and the us virgin islands ecas for emissions of nitrogen oxides  sulphur oxides  and particulate matter 
the new eca designation will enter into force on january  it is impossible to predict what additional regulations  if any  may be passed by the imo and what effect  if any  such regulations might have on our operations 
compliance enforcement the flag state  as defined by the united nations convention on the law of the sea  is responsible for implementing and enforcing a broad range of international maritime regulations with respect to all ships granted the right to fly its flag 
the shipping industry guidelines on flag state performance evaluates and reports on flag states based on factors such as sufficiency of infrastructure  ratification  implementation  and enforcement of principal international maritime treaties  supervision of statutory ship surveys  casualty investigations  and participation at imo and ilo meetings 
our vessels are flagged in the marshall islands 
marshall islands flagged vessels have historically received a good assessment in the shipping industry 
we recognize the importance of a credible flag state and do not intend to use flags of convenience or flag states with poor performance indicators 
noncompliance with the ism code or other imo regulations may subject the ship owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability  lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels or result in the denial of access to  or detention in  some ports 
as of the date of this report  each of our vessels is ism code certified 
however  there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in the future 
the imo continues to introduce new regulations 
it is impossible to predict what additional regulations  if any  may be passed by the imo and what effect  if any  such regulations might have on our operations 
the us oil pollution act of and comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act the us oil pollution act of opa established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills 
opa affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade with the united states  its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in united states waters  which includes the united states territorial sea and its nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the united states 
the united states has also enacted the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil  whether on land or at sea 
opa and cercla both define owner and operator in the case of a vessel as any person owning  operating or chartering by demise  the vessel 
both opa and cercla impact our operations 
under opa  vessel owners and operators are responsible parties and are jointly  severally and strictly liable unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party  an act of god or an act of war for all containment and clean up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels 
opa defines these other damages broadly to include i injury to  destruction or loss of  or loss of use of  natural resources and related assessment costs  ii injury to  or economic losses resulting from  the destruction of real and personal property  iii net loss of taxes  royalties  rents  fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury  destruction or loss of real or personal property  or natural resources  iv loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured  destroyed or lost  v lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury  destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources  and vi net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil  such as protection from fire  safety or health hazards  and loss of subsistence use of natural resources 
opa contains statutory caps on liability and damages  such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs 
effective july   the us coast guard adjusted the limits of opa liability for non tank vessels eg drybulk to the greater of  per gross ton or  subject to periodic adjustment for inflation 
these limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable us federal safety  construction or operating regulation by a responsible party or its agent  employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship  or a responsible party s gross negligence or willful misconduct 
the limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to i report the incident where the responsibility party knows or has reason to know of the incident  ii reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities  or iii without sufficient cause  comply with an order issued under the federal water pollution act section c  e or the intervention on the high seas act 
cercla contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup  removal and remedial costs  as well as damage for injury to  or destruction or loss of  natural resources  including the reasonable costs associated with assessing same  and health assessments or health effects studies 
there is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party  an act of god or an act of war 
liability under cercla is limited to the greater of per gross ton or million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of per gross ton or  for any other vessel 
these limits do not apply rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence  or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety  construction or operating standards or regulations 
the limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to opa 
opa and cercla both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the us coast guard evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject 
vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance  a surety bond  qualification as a self insurer or a guarantee 
we have complied with the us coast guard regulations by providing a certificate of responsibility from third party entities that are acceptable to the us coast guard evidencing sufficient self insurance 
the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico may also result in additional regulatory initiatives or statutes  including the raising of liability caps under opa 
compliance with any new requirements of opa may substantially impact our cost of operations or require us to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory initiatives or statutes 
additional legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels that may be implemented in the future could adversely affect our business 
we currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of billion per incident for each of our vessels 
if the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverage it could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation 
opa specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries  provided they accept  at a minimum  the levels of liability established under opa and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills 
in some cases  states which have enacted such legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining vessel owners responsibilities under these laws 
we intend to comply with all applicable state regulations in the ports where our vessels call 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable existing state requirements 
in addition  we intend to comply with all future applicable state regulations in the ports where our vessels call 
other environmental initiatives the us clean water act the cwa prohibits the discharge of oil  hazardous substances and ballast water in us navigable waters unless authorized by a duly issued permit or exemption  and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges 
the cwa also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal  remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under opa and cercla 
furthermore  many us states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance 
these laws may be more stringent than us federal law 
the epa regulates the discharge of ballast water and other substances in us waters under the cwa 
epa regulations require vessels feet in length or longer other than commercial fishing and recreational vessels to comply with a vessel general permit authorizing ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the operation of vessels 
the vessel general permit imposes technology and water quality based effluent limits for certain types of discharges and establishes specific inspection  monitoring  recordkeeping and reporting requirements to ensure the effluent limits are met 
the epa has proposed a draft vessel general permit to replace the current vessel general permit upon its expiration on december   authorizing discharges incidental to operations of commercial vessels 
the draft permit also contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in us waters  more stringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers and the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants 
in addition  under of the cwa  the vgp must be certified by the state where the discharge is to take place 
certain states have enacted additional discharge standards as conditions to their certification of the vgp 
these local standards bring the vgp into compliance with more stringent state requirements  such as those further restricting ballast water discharges and preventing the introduction of non indigenous species considered to be invasive 
the vgp and its state specific regulations and any similar restrictions enacted in the future will increase the costs of operating in the relevant waters 
us coast guard regulations adopted under the us national invasive species act  or nisa  also impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering or operating in us waters 
on march   the u 
s coast guard announced that it is amending its regulations on ballast water management 
as of june   the us coast guard implemented revised regulations on ballast water management by establishing standards on the allowable concentration of living organisms in ballast water discharged from ships in us waters 
compliance with the epa and the us coast guard regulations could require the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial cost  and or otherwise restrict our vessels from entering us waters 
the us clean air act of including its amendments of and the caa requires the epa to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants 
our vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading  unloading  ballasting  cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas 
our vessels that operate in such port areas with restricted cargoes are equipped with vapor recovery systems that satisfy these requirements 
the caa also requires states to draft state implementation plans sips designed to attain national health based air quality standards in each state 
although state specific  sips may include regulations concerning emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment 
as indicated above  our vessels operating in covered port areas are already equipped with vapor recovery systems that satisfy these existing requirements 
as referenced above  the amended annex vi to the imo marpol convention  which addresses air pollution from ships  was ratified by the united states on october  and entered into force on january  the epa and the state of california  however  have each proposed more stringent regulations of air emissions from ocean going vessels 
on july   the california air resources board of the state of california  or carb  approved clean fuel regulations applicable to all vessels sailing within miles of the california coastline 
the new carb regulations require such vessels to use low sulfur marine fuels rather than bunker fuel 
as of july   such vessels were required to switch either to marine gas oil with a sulfur content of no more than or marine diesel oil with a sulfur content of no more than 
as of august   only marine gas oil with a sulfur content of no more than or marine diesel oil with a sulfur content of no more than 
is allowed 
by january   only marine gas oil and marine diesel oil fuels with sulfur will be allowed 
these new regulations may require significant expenditures on low sulfur fuel and would increase our operating costs 
our operations occasionally generate and require the transportation  treatment and disposal of both hazardous and non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the us resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  or comparable state  local or foreign requirements 
the rcra imposes significant recordkeeping and reporting requirements on transporters of hazardous waste in addition  from time to time we arrange for the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances at offsite disposal facilities 
if such materials are improperly disposed of by third parties  we may still be held liable for cleanup costs under applicable laws 
european union regulations in october  the european union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship source discharges of polluting substances  including minor discharges  if committed with intent  recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water 
aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties 
member states were required to enact laws or regulations to comply with the directive by the end of criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims 
the directive applies to all types of vessels  irrespective of their flag  but certain exceptions apply to warships or where human safety or that of the ship is in danger 
greenhouse gas regulation currently  the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  which entered into force in and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
as of january   all ships must comply with mandatory requirements adopted by the mepc in july relating to greenhouse gas emissions 
all ships are required to follow the ship energy efficiency management plans 
now the minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile  outlined in the energy efficiency design index  applies to all new ships 
these requirements could cause us to incur additional compliance costs 
the imo is planning to implement market based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships at an upcoming mepc session 
the european union has indicated that it intends to propose an expansion of the existing european union emissions trading scheme to include emissions of greenhouse gases from marine vessels  and in january the european commission launched a public consultation on possible measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships 
in the united states  the epa has issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety and has adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and large stationary sources 
although the mobile source emissions regulations do not apply to greenhouse gas emissions from vessels  such regulation of vessels is foreseeable  and the epa has in recent years received petitions from the california attorney general and various environmental groups seeking such regulation 
any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the imo  european union  the us or other countries where we operate  or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the kyoto protocol  that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures which we cannot predict with certainty at this time 
international labour organization the international labour organization ilo is a specialized agency of the un with headquarters in geneva  switzerland 
the ilo has adopted the maritime labor convention mlc 
a maritime labor certificate and a declaration of maritime labor compliance will be required to ensure compliance with the mlc for all ships above gross tons in international trade 
the mlc will enter into force one year after countries with a minimum of of the world tonnage have ratified it 
on august   the required number of countries met and mlc is expected to come into force on august  the ratification of mlc will require us to develop new procedures to ensure full compliance with these results 
vessel security regulations since the terrorist attacks of september  in the united states  there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security such as the maritime transportation security act of  or mtsa 
to implement certain portions of the mtsa  in july  the us coast guard issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states 
the regulations also impose requirements on certain ports and facilities  some of which are regulated by the us environmental protection agency epa 
similarly  in december  amendments to solas created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security 
the new chapter v became effective in july and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities  and mandates compliance with the international ship and port facilities security code  or the isps code 
the isps code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism 
to trade internationally  a vessel must attain an international ship security certificate  or issc  from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel s flag state 
among the various requirements are on board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations  including information on a ship s identity  position  course  speed and navigational status  on board installation of ship security alert systems  which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore  the development of vessel security plans  ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel s hull  a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel s history including the name of the ship  the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly  the date on which the ship was registered with that state  the ship s identification number  the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner s and their registered address  and compliance with flag state security certification requirements 
ships operating without a valid certificate may be detained at port until it obtains an issc  or it may be expelled from port  or refused entry at port 
furthermore  additional security measures could be required in the future which could have a significant financial impact on us 
the us coast guard regulations  intended to be aligned with international maritime security standards  exempt non us vessels from mtsa vessel security measures  provided such vessels have on board a valid issc that attests to the vessel compliance with solas security requirements and the isps code 
we have implemented the various security measures addressed by the mtsa  solas and the isps code 
inspection by classification societies every oceangoing vessel must be classed by a classification society 
the classification society certifies that the vessel is in class  signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member 
in addition  where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state  the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order  acting on behalf of the authorities concerned 
the classification society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state 
these surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and or to the regulations of the country concerned 
for maintenance of the class certification  regular and extraordinary surveys of hull  machinery  including the electrical plant  and any special equipment classed are required to be performed as follows annual surveys 
for seagoing ships  annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery  including the electrical plant  and where applicable for special equipment classed  within three months before or after each anniversary date of the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate 
intermediate surveys 
extended annual surveys are referred to as intermediate surveys and typically are conducted two and one half years after commissioning and each class renewal 
intermediate surveys are to be carried out at or between the occasion of the second or third annual survey 
class renewal surveys 
class renewal surveys  also known as special surveys  are carried out for the ship s hull  machinery  including the electrical plant and for any special equipment classed  at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull 
at the special survey the vessel is thoroughly examined  including audio gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures 
should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements  the classification society would prescribe steel renewals 
the classification society may grant a one year grace period for completion of the special survey 
substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear 
in lieu of the special survey every four or five years  depending on whether a grace period was granted  a ship owner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle  in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five year cycle 
at an owner s application  the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class 
this process is referred to as continuous class renewal 
all areas subject to survey as defined by the classification society are required to be surveyed at least once per class period  unless shorter intervals between surveys are prescribed elsewhere 
the period between two subsequent surveys of each area must not exceed five years 
most vessels are also drydocked every to months for inspection of the underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections 
if any defects are found  the classification surveyor will issue a recommendation which must be rectified by the ship owner within prescribed time limits 
most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as in class by a classification society which is a member of the international association of classification societies  or iacs 
all our vessels that we have purchased and may agree to purchase in the future must be certified as being in class prior to their delivery under our standard purchase contracts and memorandum of agreement 
if the vessel is not certified on the date of closing  we have no obligation to take delivery of the vessel 
we have all of our vessels  and intend to have all vessels that we acquire in the future  classed by iacs members 
risk of loss and liability insurance general the operation of any dry bulk vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure  collision  property loss  cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries  hostilities and labor strikes 
in addition  there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster  including oil spills eg fuel oil and other environmental mishaps  and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade 
opa  which imposes virtually unlimited liability upon owners  operators and demise charterers of vessels trading in the united states exclusive economic zone for certain oil pollution accidents in the united states  has made liability insurance more expensive for ship owners and operators trading in the us market 
while we maintain hull and machinery insurance  war risks insurance  protection and indemnity cover and freight  demurrage and defense cover for our operating fleet in amounts that we believe to be prudent to cover normal risks in our operations  we may not be able to achieve or maintain this level of coverage throughout a vessel useful life 
furthermore  while we believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate  not all risks can be insured  and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid  or that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates 
hull machinery and war risks insurance we maintain marine hull and machinery  war risks insurances  which cover the risk of actual or constructive total loss for all of our vessels 
our vessels are each covered up to at least their fair market value with a deductible of  per vessel per incident 
protection and indemnity insurance protection and indemnity insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations  or p i associations  which insure our third party liabilities in connection with our shipping activities 
this includes third party liability and other related expenses resulting from the injury  illness or death of crew  passengers and other third parties  the loss or damage to cargo  claims arising from collisions with other vessels  damage to other third party property  pollution arising from oil or other substances and salvage  towing and other related costs  including wreck removal 
protection and indemnity insurance is a form of mutual indemnity insurance  extended by protection and indemnity mutual associations  or clubs 
subject to the capping discussed below  our coverage  except for pollution  is unlimited 
our current protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution is billion per vessel per incident 
the p i associations that comprise the international group insure approximately of the world s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association s liabilities 
as a member of a p i association  which is a member of the international group  we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on the group s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of p i associations comprising the international group 
competition we compete with a large number of international dry bulk fleets 
the international shipping industry is highly competitive and fragmented with many market participants 
as of january  there are approximately  dry bulk carriers aggregating approximately million dwt  and the ownership of the world dry bulk fleet remains very fragmented with no single owner accounting for more than of any one sector 
we primarily compete with other owners of dry bulk vessels in the handymax class that are mainly privately owned fleets 
competition in the ocean shipping industry varies primarily according to the nature of the contractual relationship as well as with respect to the kind of commodity being shipped 
our business will fluctuate in line with the main patterns of trade of dry bulk cargoes and varies according to changes in the supply and demand for these items 
competition in virtually all bulk trades is intense and based primarily on supply and demand 
we compete for charters on the basis of price  vessel location  size  age and condition of the vessel  as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator 
increasingly  major customers are demonstrating a preference for modern vessels based on concerns about the environmental and operational risks associated with older vessels 
consequently  owners of large modern fleets have gained a competitive advantage over owners of older fleets 
as in the spot market  the time charter market is price sensitive and also depends on our ability to demonstrate the high quality of our vessels and operations to chartering customers 
however  because of the longer term commitment  customers entering time charters are more concerned about their exposure and image from chartering vessels that do not comply with environmental regulations or that will be forced out of service for extensive maintenance and repairs 
consequently  in the time charter market  factors such as the age and quality of a vessel and the reputation of the owner and operator tend to be more significant than in the spot market in competing for business 
seasonality demand for vessel capacity has historically exhibited seasonal variations and  as a result  fluctuations in charter rates 
this seasonality may result in quarter to quarter volatility in our operating results for our vessels trading in the spot market and our vessels operating under time index based time charters 
the dry bulk carrier market is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and other raw materials in the northern hemisphere during the winter months 
in addition  unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities 
to the extent that we must enter into a new charter or renew an existing charter for a vessel in our fleet during a time when seasonal variations have reduced prevailing charter rates  our operating results may be adversely affected 
value of assets and cash requirements the replacement costs of comparable new vessels may be above or below the book value of our fleet 
the market value of our fleet may be below book value when market conditions are weak and exceed book value when markets are strong 
in common with other shipowners  we may consider asset redeployment which at times may include the sale of vessels at less than their book value 
the company results of operations and cash flow may be significantly affected by future charter and coa markets 
exchange controls under marshall islands law  there are currently no restrictions on the export or import of capital  including foreign exchange controls or restrictions that affect the remittance of dividends  interest or other payments to non resident holders of our common stock 
tax considerations the following is a discussion of the material marshall islands and united states federal income tax considerations relevant to owning common stock by a united states holder or a non united states holder  each as defined below 
this discussion does not purport to deal with the tax consequences of owning the common stock to all categories of investors  some of which such as financial institutions  regulated investment companies  real estate investment trusts  tax exempt organizations  insurance companies  persons holding our common stock as part of a hedging  integrated  conversion or constructive sale transaction or a straddle  traders in securities that have elected the mark to market method of accounting for their securities  persons liable for alternative minimum tax  persons who are investors in pass through entities  dealers in securities or currencies  persons who own or more of our common stock and investors whose functional currency is not the united states dollar may be subject to special rules 
this discussion deals only with holders who own the common stock as a capital asset 
shareholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors concerning the overall tax consequences arising in their own particular situation under united states federal  state  local or foreign law of the ownership of our common stock 
marshall islands tax considerations in the opinion of seward kissel llp  the following are the material marshall islands tax consequences of our activities to us and shareholders of our common stock 
we are incorporated in the marshall islands 
under current marshall islands law  we are not subject to tax on income or capital gains  and no marshall islands withholding tax will be imposed upon payments of dividends by us to our shareholders 
united states federal income tax considerations in the opinion of seward kissel llp  our united states counsel  the following are the material united states federal income tax consequences to us of our activities and to united states holders and to non united states holders of our common stock 
the following discussion of united states federal income tax matters is based on the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  judicial decisions  administrative pronouncements  and existing and proposed regulations issued by the united states department of the treasury  all of which are subject to change  possibly with retroactive effect 
in addition  the discussion below is based  in part  on the description of our business as described in business in this annual report and assumes that we conduct our business as described in that section 
we have made  or will make  special united states federal income tax elections in respect of each of our ship owning or operating subsidiaries that is potentially subject to tax as a result of deriving income attributable to the transportation of cargoes to or from the united states 
the effect of the special us tax elections is to ignore or disregard the subsidiaries for which elections have been made as separate taxable entities and to treat them as part of their parent  the company 
therefore  for purposes of the following discussion  the company  and not the subsidiaries subject to this special election  will be treated as the owner and operator of the vessels and as receiving the income therefrom 
united states federal income taxation of our company taxation of operating income in general the company currently earns  and we anticipate that the company will continue to earn  substantially all its income from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time or voyage charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses  all of which we refer to as shipping income 
unless exempt from united states federal income taxation under the rules of section of the code section  as discussed below  a foreign corporation such as ourselves will be subject to united states federal income taxation on its shipping income that is treated as derived from sources within the united states  to which we refer as united states source shipping income 
for tax purposes  united states source shipping income includes of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends  but that does not both begin and end  in the united states 
shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between non united states ports will be considered to be derived from sources outside the united states 
shipping income derived from sources outside the united states will not be subject to any united states federal income tax 
shipping income attributable to transportation exclusively between united states ports is considered to be derived from united states sources 
however  the company is not permitted by united states law to engage in the transportation of cargoes that produces united states source income 
unless exempt from tax under section  the company gross united states source shipping income would be subject to a tax imposed without allowance for deductions as described below 
exemption of operating income from united states federal income taxation under section and the regulations thereunder  a foreign corporation will be exempt from united states federal income taxation on its united states source shipping income if it is organized in a qualified foreign country  which is one that grants an equivalent exemption from tax to corporations organized in the united states in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under section and to which we refer as the country of organization test  and one of the following tests is met a more than of the value of its shares is beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by qualified shareholders  which as defined includes individuals who are residents of a qualified foreign country  to which we refer as the ownership test  b its shares are primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in a qualified foreign country or in the united states  to which we refer as the publicly traded test  or c it is a controlled foreign corporation and satisfies an ownership test  to which  collectively  we refer as the cfc test 
the republic of the marshall islands  the jurisdiction where the company is incorporated  has been officially recognized by the irs as a qualified foreign country that grants the requisite equivalent exemption from tax in respect of each category of shipping income the company earns and currently expects to earn in the future 
therefore  the company will be exempt from united states federal income taxation with respect to its united states source shipping income if it satisfies any one of the ownership test  the publicly traded test  or the cfc test 
we believe that we currently satisfy the publicly traded test  as discussed in more detail below 
the company does not currently anticipate a circumstance under which it would be able to satisfy the ownership test or the cfc test 
publicly traded test the regulations under section provide  in pertinent part  that shares of a foreign corporation will be considered to be primarily traded on an established securities market in a country if the number of shares of each class of shares that are traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of shares in each such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country 
the company common stock  which is its sole class of issued and outstanding shares  are primarily traded on the nasdaq global select market 
under the regulations  the company common stock will be considered to be regularly traded on an established securities market if one or more classes of its shares representing more than of its outstanding shares  by both total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote and total value  are listed on such market  to which we refer as the listing threshold 
since our common stock  which is our sole class of issued and outstanding shares  is listed on the nasdaq global select market  we believe that we satisfy the listing threshold 
it is further required that with respect to each class of shares relied upon to meet the listing threshold  i such class of shares is traded on the market  other than in minimal quantities  on at least days during the taxable year or one sixth of the days in a short taxable year  and ii the aggregate number of shares of such class of shares traded on such market during the taxable year is at least of the average number of shares of such class of shares outstanding during such year or as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year 
we believe the company will satisfy the trading frequency and trading volume tests 
even if this were not the case  the regulations provide that the trading frequency and trading volume tests will be deemed satisfied if  as is the case with the company common stock  such class of shares is traded on an established market in the united states and such shares are regularly quoted by dealers making a market in such shares 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the regulations provide  in pertinent part  that a class of shares will not be considered to be regularly traded on an established securities market for any taxable year in which or more of the vote and value of the outstanding shares of such class are owned  actually or constructively under specified share attribution rules  on more than half the days during the taxable year by persons who each own or more of the vote and value of such class of outstanding shares  to which we refer as the percent override rule 
for purposes of being able to determine the persons who actually or constructively own or more of the vote and value of the company common stock  or shareholders  the regulations permit the company to rely on those persons that are identified on schedule g and schedule d filings with the sec  as owning or more of the company common stock 
the regulations further provide that an investment company which is registered under the investment company act of  as amended  will not be treated as a shareholder for such purposes 
in the event the percent override rule is triggered  the regulations provide that the percent override rule will nevertheless not apply if the company can establish that within the group of shareholders  there are sufficient qualified shareholders for purposes of section to preclude non qualified shareholders in such group from owning or more of the company common stock for more than half the number of days during the taxable year  which we refer to as the percent override exception 
the company does not believe that it is currently subject to the percent override rule 
therefore  the company believes that it currently qualifies for the publicly traded test 
however  there is no assurance that the company will continue to satisfy the publicly traded test 
for example  the company shareholders could change in the future  and thus the company could become subject to the percent override rule 
taxation in absence of section exemption if the benefits of section are unavailable  the company united states source shipping income would be subject to a tax imposed by section of the code on a gross basis  without the benefit of deductions  to the extent that such income is not considered to be effectively connected with the conduct of a united states trade or business  as described below 
since under the sourcing rules described above  no more than of the company shipping income would be treated as being united states source shipping income  the maximum effective rate of united states federal income tax on our shipping income would never exceed under the gross basis tax regime 
based on the current operation of our vessels  if we were subject to gross basis tax  our united states federal income tax liability would be approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
however  we can give no assurance that the operation of our vessels  which are under the control of third party charterers  will not change such that our united states federal income tax liability would be substantially higher 
to the extent the company united states source shipping income is considered to be effectively connected with the conduct of a united states trade or business  as described below  any such effectively connected united states source shipping income  net of applicable deductions  would be subject to united states federal income tax  currently imposed at rates of up to 
in addition  the company may be subject to the branch profits tax on earnings effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business  as determined after allowance for certain adjustments  and on certain interest paid or deemed paid attributable to the conduct of the company united states trade or business 
the company united states source shipping income would be considered effectively connected with the conduct of a united states trade or business only if the company has  or is considered to have  a fixed place of business in the united states involved in the earning of united states source shipping income  and substantially all of the company united states source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation  such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the united states 
the company does not intend to have  or permit circumstances that would result in having  any vessel sailing to or from the united states on a regularly scheduled basis 
based on the foregoing and on the expected mode of the company shipping operations and other activities  we believe that none of the company united states source shipping income will be effectively connected with the conduct of a united states trade or business 
united states taxation of gain on sale of vessels if the company qualifies for exemption from tax under section in respect of the shipping income derived from the international operation of its vessels  then gain from the sale of any such vessel should likewise be exempt from tax under section if  however  the company shipping income from such vessels does not for whatever reason qualify for exemption under section and assuming that any decision on a vessel sale is made from and attributable to the united states office of the company  as we believe likely to be the case as the company is currently structured  then any gain derived from the sale of any such vessel will be treated as derived from united states sources and subject to united states federal income tax as effectively connected income determined under rules different from those discussed above under the above described net income tax regime 
united states federal income taxation of united states holders as used herein  the term united states holder means a beneficial owner of common stock that is an individual united states citizen or resident  a united states corporation or other united states entity taxable as a corporation  an estate the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source  or a trust if a court within the united states is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more united states persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust 
if a partnership holds our common stock  the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership 
if you are a partner in a partnership holding our common stock  you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor 
distributions subject to the discussion of passive foreign investment companies below  any distributions made by the company with respect to its common stock to a united states holder will generally constitute dividends to the extent of the company current or accumulated earnings and profits  as determined under united states federal income tax principles 
distributions in excess of such earnings and profits will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the united states holder tax basis in his common stock on a dollar for dollar basis and thereafter as capital gain 
because the company is not a united states corporation  united states holders that are corporations will not be entitled to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to any distributions they receive from us 
dividends paid with respect to the company common stock will generally be treated as passive category income for purposes of computing allowable foreign tax credits for united states foreign tax credit purposes 
dividends paid on the company common stock to a united states holder who is an individual  trust or estate a united states non corporate holder will generally be treated as qualified dividend income that is taxable to such united states non corporate holder at preferential tax rates provided that the common stock is readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states such as the nasdaq global select market on which the company common stock is traded  the company is not a passive foreign investment company for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the immediately preceding taxable year which we do not believe we have been  are or will be  the united states non corporate holder has owned the common stock for more than days in the day period beginning days before the date on which the common stock becomes ex dividend  and the united states non corporate holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property 
there is no assurance that any dividends paid on the company common stock will be eligible for these preferential rates in the hands of a united states non corporate holder  although we believe that they will be so eligible 
any dividends out of earnings  and profits the company pays  which are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed as ordinary income to a united states non corporate holder 
special rules may apply to any extraordinary dividend generally  a dividend in an amount which is equal to or in excess of of a shareholder adjusted basis in a common share paid by the company 
if the company pays an extraordinary dividend on its common stock that is treated as qualified dividend income  then any loss derived by a united states non corporate holder from the sale or exchange of such common stock will be treated as long term capital loss to the extent of such dividend 
sale  exchange or other disposition of common stock assuming the company does not constitute a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year  a united states holder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss upon a sale  exchange or other disposition of the company common stock in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the united states holder from such sale  exchange or other disposition and the united states holder tax basis in such stock 
such gain or loss will be treated as long term capital gain or loss if the united states holder holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale  exchange or other disposition 
such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as united states source income or loss  as applicable  for united states foreign tax credit purposes 
long term capital gains of united states non corporate holders are currently eligible for reduced rates of taxation 
a united states holder ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain limitations 
passive foreign investment company status and significant tax consequences special united states federal income tax rules apply to a united states holder that holds shares in a foreign corporation classified as a passive foreign investment company for united states federal income tax purposes 
in general  the company will be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to a united states holder if  for any taxable year in which such holder holds the company common stock  either at least of our gross income for such taxable year consists of passive income eg  dividends  interest  capital gains and rents derived other than in the active conduct of a rental business  or at least of the average value of our assets during such taxable year produce  or are held for the production of  passive income 
income earned  or deemed earned  by the company in connection with the performance of services would not constitute passive income 
by contrast  rental income would generally constitute passive income unless the company was treated under specific rules as deriving its rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business 
based on the company current operations and future projections  we do not believe that the company has been or is  nor do we expect the company to become  a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year 
although there is no legal authority directly on point  our belief is based principally on the position that  for purposes of determining whether the company is a passive foreign investment company  the gross income it derives from its time chartering and voyage chartering activities should constitute services income  rather than rental income 
accordingly  such income should not constitute passive income  and the assets that the company owns and operates in connection with the production of such income  in particular  the vessels  should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether the company is a passive foreign investment company 
we believe there is substantial legal authority supporting our position consisting of case law and irs pronouncements concerning the characterization of income derived from time charters and voyage charters as services income for other tax purposes 
however  there is also authority which characterizes time charter income as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes 
in addition  we have obtained an opinion from our counsel  seward kissel llp  that  based upon the company operations as described herein  its income from time charters and voyage charters should not be treated as passive income for purposes of determining whether it is a passive foreign investment company 
however  in the absence of any legal authority specifically relating to the statutory provisions governing passive foreign investment companies  the irs or a court could disagree with our position 
in addition  although the company intends to conduct its affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a passive foreign investment company with respect to any taxable year  we cannot assure you that the nature of its operations will not change in the future 
as discussed more fully below  if the company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year  a united states holder would be subject to different taxation rules depending on whether the united states holder makes an election to treat the company as a qualified electing fund  which election we refer to as a qef election 
as an alternative to making a qef election  a united states holder should be able to make a mark to market election with respect to the company common stock  as discussed below 
in addition  if we were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year after  a us holder would be required to file an annual report with the internal revenue service for that year with respect to such holder s common stock 
taxation of united states holders making a timely qef election if a united states holder makes a timely qef election  which united states holder we refer to as an electing holder  the electing holder must report for united states federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the company ordinary earnings and net capital gain  if any  for each taxable year of the company for which it is a passive foreign investment company that ends with or within the taxable year of the electing holder  regardless of whether or not distributions were received from the company by the electing holder 
no portion of any such inclusions of ordinary earnings will be treated as qualified dividend income 
net capital gain inclusions of united states non corporate holders would be eligible for preferential capital gains tax rates 
the electing holder adjusted tax basis in the common stock will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings and profits 
distributions of earnings and profits that had been previously taxed will result in a corresponding reduction in the adjusted tax basis in the common stock and will not be taxed again once distributed 
an electing holder would not  however  be entitled to a deduction for its pro rata share of any losses that the company incurs with respect to any year 
an electing holder would generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale  exchange or other disposition of the company common stock 
a united states holder would make a timely qef election for shares of the company by filing one copy of irs form with his united states federal income tax return for the first year in which he held such shares when the company was a passive foreign investment company 
if the company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year  the company would provide each united states holder with all necessary information in order to make the qef election described above 
taxation of united states holders making a mark to market election alternatively  if the company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year and  as we anticipate  its shares are treated as marketable stock  a united states holder would be allowed to make a mark to market election with respect to the company common stock  provided the united states holder completes and files irs form in accordance with the relevant instructions and related treasury regulations 
if that election is made  the united states holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of the taxable year over such holder adjusted tax basis in the common stock 
the united states holder would also be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess  if any  of the united states holder adjusted tax basis in the common stock over its fair market value at the end of the taxable year  but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark to market election 
a united states holder tax basis in his common stock would be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amount 
gain realized on the sale  exchange or other disposition of the company common stock would be treated as ordinary income  and any loss realized on the sale  exchange or other disposition of the common would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark to market gains previously included by the united states holder 
no income inclusions under this election will be treated as qualified dividend income 
taxation of united states holders not making a timely qef or mark to market election finally  if the company were to be treated as a passive foreign investment company for any taxable year  a united states holder who does not make either a qef election or a mark to market election for that year  whom we refer to as a non electing holder  would be subject to special rules with respect to any excess distribution ie  the portion of any distributions received by the non electing holder on the common stock in a taxable year in excess of of the average annual distributions received by the non electing holder in the three preceding taxable years  or  if shorter  the non electing holder holding period for the common stock  and any gain realized on the sale  exchange or other disposition of the company common stock 
under these special rules the excess distribution or gain would be allocated ratably over the non electing holder aggregate holding period for the common stock  the amount allocated to the current taxable year  and any taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which the company was a passive foreign investment company  would be taxed as ordinary income and would not be qualified dividend income  and the amount allocated to each of the other taxable years would be subject to tax at the highest rate of tax in effect for the applicable class of taxpayer for that year  and an interest charge for the deemed deferral benefit would be imposed with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such other taxable year 
these special rules would not apply to a qualified pension  profit sharing or other retirement trust or other tax exempt organization that did not borrow money or otherwise utilize leverage in connection with its acquisition of the company common stock 
if the company is a passive foreign investment company and a non electing holder who is an individual dies while owning the company common stock  such holder successor generally would not receive a step up in tax basis with respect to such shares 
united states federal income taxation of non united states holders a beneficial owner of common stock other than a partnership that is not a united states holder is referred to herein as a non united states holder 
if a partnership holds our common stock  the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership 
if you are a partner in a partnership holding our common stock  you are encouraged to consult your tax advisor 
dividends on common stock non united states holders generally will not be subject to united states federal income tax or withholding tax on dividends received from the company with respect to its common stock  unless that income is effectively connected with the non united states holder conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
if the non united states holder is entitled to the benefits of a united states income tax treaty with respect to those dividends  that income is taxable only if it is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non united states holder in the united states 
sale  exchange or other disposition of common stock non united states holders generally will not be subject to united states federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain realized upon the sale  exchange or other disposition of the company common stock  unless the gain is effectively connected with the non united states holder conduct of a trade or business in the united states and  if the non united states holder is entitled to the benefits of an income tax treaty with respect to that gain  that gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non united states holder in the united states  or the non united states holder is an individual who is present in the united states for days or more during the taxable year of disposition and other conditions are met 
if the non united states holder is engaged in a united states trade or business for united states federal income tax purposes  the income from the common stock  including dividends and the gain from the sale  exchange or other disposition of the shares  that is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business will generally be subject to regular united states federal income tax in the same manner as discussed in the previous section relating to the taxation of united states holders 
in addition  if you are a corporate non united states holder  your earnings and profits that are attributable to the effectively connected income  which are subject to certain adjustments  may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of  or at a lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty 
backup withholding and information reporting in general  dividend payments  or other taxable distributions  made within the united states to you will be subject to information reporting requirements if you are a non corporate united states holder 
such payments or distributions may also be subject to backup withholding tax if you are a non corporate united states holder and you fail to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number  are notified by the irs that you have failed to report all interest or dividends required to be shown on your federal income tax returns  or in certain circumstances  fail to comply with applicable certification requirements 
non united states holders may be required to establish their exemption from information reporting and backup withholding by certifying their status on irs form w ben  w eci or w imy  as applicable 
if you are a non united states holder and you sell your common stock to or through a united states office of a broker  the payment of the proceeds is subject to both united states backup withholding and information reporting unless you certify that you are a non united states person  under penalties of perjury  or you otherwise establish an exemption 
if you sell your common stock through a non united states office of a non united states broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the united states  then information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment 
however  united states information reporting requirements  but not backup withholding  will apply to a payment of sales proceeds  even if that payment is made to you outside the united states  if you sell your common stock through a non united states office of a broker that is a united states person or has some other contacts with the united states 
such information reporting requirements will not apply  however  if the broker has documentary evidence in its records that you are a non united states person and certain other conditions are met  or you otherwise establish an exemption 
backup withholding tax is not an additional tax 
rather  you generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a refund claim with the irs 
pursuant to recently enacted legislation  individuals who are united states holders and to the extent specified in applicable treasury regulations  certain united states entities and non united states holders who hold specified foreign financial assets as defined in section d of the code are required to file irs form with information relating to the asset for each taxable year in which the aggregate value of all such assets exceeds  at any time during the taxable year or  on the last day of the taxable year or such higher dollar amount as prescribed by applicable treasury regulations 
specified foreign financial assets would include  among other assets  our common shares  unless the shares are held through an account maintained with a united states financial institution 
substantial penalties apply to any failure to timely file irs form  unless the failure is shown to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect 
additionally  in the event an individual united states holder and to the extent specified in applicable treasury regulations  a united states entity and non united states holders that is required to file irs form does not file such form  the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of united states federal income taxes of such holder for the related tax year may not close until three years after the date that the required information is filed

item a 
risk factors we operate in an intensely competitive industry 
some of the following risks relate principally to the industry in which we operate and our business in general 
other risks relate principally to the securities market  national and global economic conditions and the ownership of our common stock 
the occurrence of any of the events described in this section could cause our results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements made in this report  and could significantly and negatively affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
industry specific risk factors charter hire rates for dry bulk vessels are volatile and have declined significantly since their historic highs and may continue to decrease in the future  which may adversely affect our earnings  revenue and profitability and our ability to comply with our loan covenants 
the dry bulk shipping industry is cyclical with high volatility in charter hire rates and profitability 
the degree of charter hire rate volatility among different types of dry bulk vessels has varied widely  however  the continued downturn in the drybulk charter market has severely affected the entire dry bulk shipping industry and charter hire rates for dry bulk vessels have declined significantly from historically high levels 
the baltic dry index the bdi  a daily average of charter rates for key dry bulk routes published by the baltic exchange limited  which has long been viewed as the main benchmark to monitor the movements of the dry bulk vessel charter market and the performance of the entire dry bulk shipping market  declined in from a peak of  in may to a low of in december and has remained volatile since then 
the bdi recorded a record low of in while the bdi since increased to  as of march   there can be no assurance that the drybulk charter market will increase further  and the market could decline 
fluctuations in charter rates result from changes in the supply of and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply of and demand for the major commodities carried by water internationally 
because the factors affecting the supply of and demand for vessels are outside of our control and are unpredictable  the nature  timing  direction and degree of changes in industry conditions are also unpredictable 
if charter rates in the dry bulk market continue to decline and remain at low levels for any significant period in  this will have an adverse effect on our revenues  profitability  cash flows and our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our loan agreements 
factors that influence demand for dry bulk vessel capacity include supply of and demand for energy resources  commodities and industrial products  changes in the exploration or production of energy resources  commodities  consumer and industrial products  the location of regional and global exploration  production and manufacturing facilities  the location of consuming regions for energy resources  commodities  semi finished and finished consumer and industrial products  the globalization of production and manufacturing  global and regional economic and political conditions  including armed conflicts and terrorist activities  embargoes and strikes  developments in international trade  changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns  including the distance cargo is transported by sea  environmental and other regulatory developments  currency exchange rates  and weather 
factors that influence the supply of vessel capacity include the number of newbuilding deliveries  port and canal congestion  the scrapping of older vessels  vessel casualties  and the number of vessels that are out of service  namely those that are laid up  drydocked  awaiting repairs or otherwise not available for hire 
in addition to the prevailing and anticipated freight rates  factors that affect the rate of newbuilding  scrapping and laying up include newbuilding prices  secondhand vessel values in relation to scrap prices  costs of bunkers and other operating costs  costs associated with classification society surveys  normal maintenance and insurance coverage  the efficiency and age profile of the existing dry bulk fleet in the market and government and industry regulation of maritime transportation practices  particularly environmental protection laws and regulations 
these factors influencing the supply of and demand for shipping capacity are outside of our control  and we may not be able to correctly assess the nature  timing and degree of changes in industry conditions 
we anticipate that the future demand for our dry bulk vessels will be dependent upon economic growth in the world economies  including china and india  seasonal and regional changes in demand  changes in the capacity of the global dry bulk fleet and the sources and supply of dry bulk cargo to be transported by sea 
given the large number of new dry bulk carriers currently on order with the shipyards  the capacity of the global dry bulk carrier fleet seems likely to increase and there can be no assurance that economic growth will resume or continue 
adverse economic  political  social or other developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
because we employ most of our vessels on short term time and voyage charters and charters whose revenues are directly tied to the baltic supramax index  we are exposed to changes in the spot market and short term charter rates for dry bulk carriers and such changes may affect our earnings and the value of our vessel sat any given time 
in addition  as of december   of our vessels were scheduled to be redelivered from their charterers in we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully renew the charters for these vessels at rates sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations 
if the very low charter rates in the dry bulk market continue to exist when we are required to renew these charters or in the future when our other charters must be renewed  this may have an adverse effect on our revenues  profitability  cash flows and our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our loan agreements 
in addition  because the market value of our vessels may fluctuate significantly  we may incur losses when we sell vessels  which may adversely affect our earnings 
if we sell vessels at a time when vessel prices have fallen and before we have recorded an impairment adjustment to our financial statements  the sale may be at less than the vessel carrying amount on our financial statements  resulting in a loss and a reduction in earnings 
the recent global economic downturn may continue to negatively impact our business 
in the current global economy  operating businesses have recently faced tightening credit  weakening demand for goods and services  weak international liquidity conditions  and declining markets 
lower demand for dry bulk cargoes as well as diminished trade credit available for the delivery of such cargoes have led to decreased demand for dry bulk carriers  creating downward pressure on charter rates and vessel values 
the recent economic downturn has had and may continue to have during a number of adverse consequences for dry bulk and other shipping sectors  including  among other things an absence of financing for vessels  a further decrease in the market value of our vessels and no active second hand market for the sale of vessels  low charter rates  particularly for vessels employed on short term time charters or in the spot market  widespread loan covenant defaults  and declaration of bankruptcy by some operators and shipowners  as well as charterers 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the current state of global financial markets and current economic conditions may adversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing credit facility on acceptable terms  which may hinder or prevent us from operating or expanding our business 
global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  volatile 
recently  the debt and equity capital markets have been severely distressed 
these issues  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk and the current weak economic conditions  have made  and will likely continue to make  it difficult to obtain additional financing 
the current state of global financial markets and current economic conditions might adversely impact our ability to issue additional equity at prices which will not be dilutive to our existing shareholders or preclude us from issuing equity at all 
also  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to current debt and reduced  and in some cases ceased  to provide funding to borrowers 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available if needed and to the extent required  or that we will be able to refinance our existing credit facility  on acceptable terms or at all 
if additional financing or refinancing is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to enhance our existing business  complete additional drilling unit acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
the instability of the euro or the inability of countries to refinance their debts could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  profitability and financial position 
as a result of the credit crisis in europe  in particular in greece  italy  ireland  portugal and spain  the european commission created the european financial stability facility the efsf and the european financial stability mechanism the efsm to provide funding to eurozone countries in financial difficulties that seek such support 
in march  the european council agreed on the need for eurozone countries to establish a permanent stability mechanism  the european stability mechanism  or the esm  which will be activated by mutual agreement  to assume the role of the efsf and the efsm in providing external financial assistance to eurozone countries 
despite these measures  concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations and the overall stability of the euro 
an extended period of adverse development in the outlook for european countries could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas and for our services 
these potential developments  or market perceptions concerning these and related issues  could affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
changes in the economic and political environment in china and policies adopted by the government to regulate its economy may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the chinese economy differs from the economies of most countries belonging to the organization for economic cooperation and development  or oecd  in such respects as structure  government involvement  level of development  growth rate  capital reinvestment  allocation of resources  rate of inflation and balance of payments position 
prior to  the chinese economy was a planned economy 
since  increasing emphasis has been placed on the utilization of market forces in the development of the chinese economy 
annual and five year state plans are adopted by the chinese government in connection with the development of the economy 
although state owned enterprises still account for a substantial portion of the chinese industrial output  in general  the chinese government is reducing the level of direct control that it exercises over the economy through state plans and other measures 
there is an increasing level of freedom and autonomy in areas such as allocation of resources  production  pricing and management and a gradual shift in emphasis to a market economy and enterprise reform 
limited price reforms were undertaken with the result that prices for certain commodities are principally determined by market forces 
many of the reforms are unprecedented or experimental and may be subject to revision  change or abolition based upon the outcome of such experiments 
if the chinese government does not continue to pursue a policy of economic reform  the level of imports to and exports from china could be adversely affected by changes to these economic reforms by the chinese government  as well as by changes in political  economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the chinese government  such as changes in laws  regulations or export and import restrictions  all of which could  adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the market values of our vessels have declined and may further decrease  which could limit the amount of funds that we can borrow or cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our current or future credit facilities and we may incur a loss if we sell vessels following a decline in their market value 
the fair market values of our vessels have generally experienced high volatility and have recently declined significantly 
the market prices for secondhand handymax and supramax dry bulk carriers have recently decreased sharply from their historically high levels 
the fair market value of our vessels may continue to fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including prevailing level of charter rates  general economic and market conditions affecting the shipping industry  types  sizes and ages of vessels  supply of and demand for vessels  other modes of transportation  cost of newbuildings  governmental or other regulations  the need to upgrade secondhand and previously owned vessels as a result of charterer requirements  technological advances in vessel design or equipment or otherwise  and technological advances 
if the fair market value of our vessels declines  we may not be in compliance with certain covenants contained in our credit facility and we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing 
if we are not able to comply with the covenants in our credit facility  and are unable to remedy the relevant breach  our lenders could accelerate our debt and foreclose on our fleet 
in addition  if we sell one or more of our vessels at a time when vessel prices have fallen and before we have recorded an impairment adjustment to our consolidated financial statements  the sale may be less than the vessel carrying value on our consolidated financial statements  resulting in a loss and a reduction in earnings 
furthermore  if vessel values persist or decline further  we may have to record an impairment adjustment in our financial statements which could adversely affect our financial results 
conversely  if vessel values are elevated at a time when we wish to acquire additional vessels  the cost of acquisition may increase and this could adversely affect our business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
rising fuel  or bunker prices  may adversely affect profits 
while we generally do not bear the cost of fuel  or bunkers  for vessels operating on time charters  fuel is a significant factor in negotiating charter rates 
as a result  an increase in the price of fuel beyond our expectations may adversely affect our profitability at the time of charter negotiation 
fuel is also a significant  if not the largest  expense in our shipping operations when vessels are under voyage charter 
the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
further  fuel may become much more expensive in the future  which may reduce the profitability and competitiveness of our business versus other forms of transportation  such as truck or rail 
compliance with safety and other vessel requirements imposed by classification societies may be very costly and may adversely affect our business 
the hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by a classification society authorized by its country of registry 
the classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the safety of life at sea convention 
a vessel must undergo annual surveys  intermediate surveys and special surveys 
in lieu of a special survey  a vessel s machinery may be on a continuous survey cycle under which the machinery would be surveyed periodically over a five year period 
every vessel is also required to be drydocked every two and a half to five years for inspection of its underwater parts 
compliance with the above requirements may result in significant expense 
if any vessel does not maintain its class or fails any annual  intermediate or special survey  the vessel will be unable to trade between ports and will be unemployable and uninsurable  which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the form of international conventions and treaties  national  state and local laws and national and international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate or are registered  which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of our vessels 
these regulations include  but are not limited to  opa  cercla  the us clean air act  us clean water act and the mtsa  and regulations of the imo  including the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships of  the international convention for the prevention of marine pollution of  the imo international convention for the safety of life at sea of and the international convention on load lines of compliance with such laws  regulations and standards  where applicable  may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes and may affect the resale value or useful lives of our vessels 
we may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory obligations  including  but not limited to  costs relating to air emissions  the management of ballast waters  maintenance and inspection  development and implementation of emergency procedures and insurance coverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents 
these costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties  criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations 
environmental laws often impose strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances  which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault 
under opa  for example  owners  operators and bareboat charterers are jointly and severally strictly liable for the discharge of oil within the mile exclusive economic zone around the united states 
furthermore  the explosion of the deepwater horizon and the subsequent release of oil into the gulf of mexico  or other events  may result in further regulation of the shipping industry  and modifications to statutory liability schemes  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
an oil spill could result in significant liability  including fines  penalties and criminal liability and remediation costs for natural resource damages under other federal  state and local laws  as well as third party damages 
we are required to satisfy insurance and financial responsibility requirements for potential oil including marine fuel spills and other pollution incidents 
although we have arranged insurance to cover certain environmental risks  there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover all such risks or that any claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends  if any  in the future 
further declines in charter rates and other market deterioration could cause us to incur impairment charges 
we evaluate the carrying amounts of our vessels to determine if events have occurred that would require an impairment of their carrying amounts 
the recoverable amount of vessels is reviewed based on events and changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recovered 
the review for potential impairment indicators and projection of future cash flows related to the vessels is complex and requires us to make various estimates including future freight rates  earnings from the vessels and discount rates 
all of these items have been historically volatile 
we evaluate the recoverable amount as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use 
if the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the vessel  the vessel is deemed impaired 
the carrying values of our vessels may not represent their fair market value in the future because the new market prices of second hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings 
any impairment charges incurred as a result of declines in charter rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
an over supply of dry bulk carrier capacity may prolong or further depress the current low charter rates  which may limit our ability to operate our dry bulk carriers profitably 
the supply of drybulk vessels has increased significantly since the beginning of however  as of march   the majority of newbuilding orders which were placed over recent years was completed  and the current orderbook  stands at of the fleet outstanding 
supply growth has been outpacing demand growth over the past few years causing downward pressure on charter rates 
until this new supply gets fully absorbed by the market  charter rates may continue to be under pressure in the near to medium term 
since our fleet is predominantly fixed on short term charters  the company remains exposed to the spot market 
a decrease in the level of china s export of goods or an increase in trade protectionism could have a material adverse impact on our charterers business and  in turn  could cause a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
china exports considerably more goods than it imports 
our vessels may be deployed on routes involving trade in and out of emerging markets  and our charterers shipping and business revenue may be derived from the shipment of goods from the asia pacific region to various overseas export markets including the united states and europe 
any reduction in or hindrance to the output of china based exporters could have a material adverse effect on the growth rate of china s exports and on our charterers business 
for instance  the government of china has recently implemented economic policies aimed at increasing domestic consumption of chinese made goods 
this may have the effect of reducing the supply of goods available for export and may  in turn  result in a decrease of demand for container shipping 
additionally  though in china there is an increasing level of autonomy and a gradual shift in emphasis to a market economy and enterprise reform  many of the reforms  particularly some limited price reforms that result in the prices for certain commodities being principally determined by market forces  are unprecedented or experimental and may be subject to revision  change or abolition 
the level of imports to and exports from china could be adversely affected by changes to these economic reforms by the chinese government  as well as by changes in political  economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the chinese government 
our operations expose us to the risk that increased trade protectionism will adversely affect our business 
if the incipient global recovery is undermined by downside risks and the recent economic downturn is prolonged  governments may turn to trade barriers to protect their domestic industries against foreign imports  thereby depressing the demand for shipping 
specifically  increasing trade protectionism in the markets that our charterers serve has caused and may continue to cause an increase in i the cost of goods exported from china  ii the length of time required to deliver goods from china and iii the risks associated with exporting goods from china  as well as a decrease in the quantity of goods to be shipped 
any increased trade barriers or restrictions on trade  especially trade with china  would have an adverse impact on our charterers business  operating results and financial condition and could thereby affect their ability to make timely charter hire payments to us and to renew and increase the number of their time charters with us 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
world events could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
terrorist attacks such as those in new york on september   in london on july   and in mumbai on november   as well as the threat of future terrorist attacks around the world  continues to cause uncertainty in the world s financial markets and may affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
continuing conflicts and recent developments in the middle east  including egypt and north africa  and the presence of us or other armed forces in the middle east  may lead to additional acts of terrorism and armed conflict around the world  which may contribute to further economic instability in the global financial markets 
these uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in the past  political conflicts have also resulted in attacks on vessels  such as the attack on the mt limburg  a vessel unaffiliated with us  in october  mining of waterways and other efforts to disrupt international shipping  particularly in the arabian gulf region 
acts of terrorism and piracy have also affected vessels trading in regions such as the south china sea and the gulf of aden off the coast of somalia 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results  revenues and costs 
acts of piracy on ocean going vessels have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business 
acts of piracy have historically affected ocean going vessels trading in regions of the world such as the south china sea  the indian ocean and in the gulf of aden off the coast of somalia 
although the frequency of sea piracy worldwide decreased during to its lowest level since  sea piracy incidents continue to occur  particularly in the gulf of aden off the coast of somalia and increasingly in the gulf of guinea and the west coast of africa  with dry bulk vessels and tankers particularly vulnerable to such attacks 
if these piracy attacks result in regions in which our vessels are deployed being characterized as war risk zones by insurers  as the gulf of aden temporarily was in may  or joint war committee war and strikes listed areas  premiums payable for such coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain 
in addition  crew costs  including due to employing onboard security guards  could increase in such circumstances 
furthermore  while we believe the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates  the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released 
a charterer may also claim that a vessel seized by pirates was not on hire for a certain number of days and is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party  a claim that we would dispute 
we may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  any detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels  or an increase in cost  or unavailability  of insurance for our vessels  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our vessels may call on ports located in countries that are subject to restrictions imposed by the us or other governments  that could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our common stock 
although none of our vessels has called on ports located in countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the us government and other authorities or countries identified by the us government or other authorities as state sponsors of terrorism  such as cuba  iran  sudan and syria  from time to time on charterers instructions  our vessels may call on ports located in such countries in the future 
the us sanctions and embargo laws and regulations vary in their application  as they do not all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities  and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or strengthened over time 
in  the us enacted the comprehensive iran sanctions accountability and divestment act cisada  which amended the iran sanctions act 
among other things  cisada introduced limits on the ability of companies and persons to do business or trade with iran when such activities relate to the investment  supply or export of refined petroleum or petroleum products 
in  president obama signed executive order which prohibits foreign persons from violating or attempting to violate  or causing a violation of any sanctions in effect against iran or facilitating any deceptive transactions for or on behalf of any person subject to us sanctions 
any persons found to be in violation of executive order will be deemed a foreign sanctions evader and will be banned from all contacts with the united states  including conducting business in us dollars 
also in  president obama signed into law the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of the iran threat reduction act  which created new sanctions and strengthened existing sanctions 
among other things  the iran threat reduction act intensifies existing sanctions regarding the provision of goods  services  infrastructure or technology to iran petroleum or petrochemical sector 
the iran threat reduction act also includes a provision requiring the president of the united states to impose five or more sanctions from section a of the iran sanctions act  as amended  on a person the president determines is a controlling beneficial owner of  or otherwise owns  operates  or controls or insures a vessel that was used to transport crude oil from iran to another country and if the person is a controlling beneficial owner of the vessel  the person had actual knowledge the vessel was so used or if the person otherwise owns  operates  or controls  or insures the vessel  the person knew or should have known the vessel was so used 
such a person could be subject to a variety of sanctions  including exclusion from us capital markets  exclusion from financial transactions subject to us jurisdiction  and exclusion of that person vessels from us ports for up to two years 
although we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations  and intend to maintain such compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future  particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations 
any such violation could result in fines or other penalties and could severely impact our ability to access us capital markets and conduct our business  and could result in some investors deciding  or being required  to divest their interest  or not to invest  in us 
in addition  certain institutional investors may have investment policies or restrictions that prevent them from holding securities of companies that have contracts with countries identified by the us government as state sponsors of terrorism 
the determination by these investors not to invest in  or to divest from  our common shares may adversely affect the price at which our common shares trade 
moreover  our charterers may violate applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations as a result of actions that do not involve us or our vessels  and those violations could in turn negatively affect our reputation 
in addition  our reputation and the market for our securities may be adversely affected if we engage in certain other activities  such as entering into charters with individuals or entities in countries subject to us sanctions and embargo laws that are not controlled by the governments of those countries  or engaging in operations associated with those countries pursuant to contracts with third parties that are unrelated to those countries or entities controlled by their governments 
investor perception of the value of our common shares may be adversely affected by the consequences of war  the effects of terrorism  civil unrest and governmental actions in these and surrounding countries 
if economic conditions throughout the world do not improve  it will impede our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows  and could cause the market price of our common shares to further decline 
negative trends in the global economy that emerged in continue to adversely affect global economic conditions 
in addition  the world economy is currently facing a number of new challenges  including uncertainty related to the continuing discussions in the united states regarding the federal debt ceiling and recent turmoil and hostilities in the middle east  north africa and other geographic areas and countries 
the deterioration in the global economy has caused  and may continue to cause  a decrease in worldwide demand for certain goods and  thus  shipping 
continuing economic instability could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy 
the united states  the european union and other parts of the world have recently been or are currently in a recession and continue to exhibit weak economic trends 
the credit markets in the united states and europe have experienced significant contraction  deleveraging and reduced liquidity  and the us federal and state governments and european authorities have implemented and are considering a broad variety of governmental action and or new regulation of the financial markets and may implement additional regulations in the future 
securities and futures markets and the credit markets are subject to comprehensive statutes  regulations and other requirements 
the sec  other regulators  self regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of market emergencies  and may effect changes in law or interpretations of existing laws 
global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  severely disrupted and volatile 
credit markets and the debt and equity capital markets have been exceedingly distressed and the uncertainty surrounding the future of the credit markets in the united states and the rest of the world has resulted in reduced access to credit worldwide 
we face risks attendant to changes in economic environments  changes in interest rates  and instability in the banking and securities markets around the world  among other factors 
major market disruptions and the current adverse changes in market conditions and regulatory climate in the united states and worldwide may adversely affect our business or impair our ability to borrow amounts under our credit facilities or any future financial arrangements 
we cannot predict how long the current market conditions will last 
however  these recent and developing economic and governmental factors  together with the concurrent decline in charter rates and vessel values  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  have caused the trading price of our common shares on the nasdaq global select market to decline and could cause the price of our common shares to continue to decline 
continued economic slowdown in the asia pacific region  particularly in china  may exacerbate the effect on us  as we anticipate a significant number of the port calls made by our vessels will continue to involve the loading or discharging of dry bulk commodities in ports in the asia pacific region 
before the global economic financial crisis that began in  china had one of the world s fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product gdp  which had a significant impact on shipping demand 
the growth rate of china s gdp is estimated to have decreased for the third year in a row to approximately for the year ended december   and continues to remain below pre levels 
china has recently imposed measures to restrain lending  which may further contribute to a slowdown in its economic growth 
it is possible that china and other countries in the asia pacific region will continue to experience slowed or even negative economic growth in the near future 
moreover  the current economic slowdown in the economies of the united states  the european union and other asian countries may further adversely affect economic growth in china and elsewhere 
our business  financial condition and results of operations  ability to pay dividends as well as our future prospects  will likely be materially and adversely affected by a further economic downturn in any of these countries 
our operating results will be subject to seasonal fluctuations  which could affect our operating results 
we operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and  as a result  in charter hire rates 
this seasonality may result in volatility in our operating results to the extent that we enter into new charter agreements or renew existing agreements during a time when charter rates are weaker or we operate our vessels on the spot market or index based time charters  which may result in quarter to quarter volatility in our operating results 
the dry bulk sector is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and other raw materials in the northern hemisphere 
in addition  unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities 
as a result  our revenues from our dry bulk carriers may be weaker during the fiscal quarters ended june and september  and  conversely  our revenues from our dry bulk carriers may be stronger in fiscal quarters ended december and march we are subject to international safety regulations and the failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to increased liability  may adversely affect our insurance coverage and may result in a denial of access to  or detention in  certain ports 
the operation of our vessels is affected by the requirements set forth in the ism code 
the ism code requires ship owners  ship managers and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive safety management system that includes the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies 
the failure of a shipowner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ism code may subject it to increased liability  may invalidate existing insurance or decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to  or detention in  certain ports 
each of the vessels that has been delivered to us is ism code certified and we expect that each other vessel that we have agreed to purchase will be ism code certified when delivered to us 
however  if we are subject to increased liability for non compliance or if our insurance coverage is adversely impacted as a result of non compliance  it may negatively affect our ability to pay dividends  if any  in the future 
if any of our vessels are denied access to  or are detained in  certain ports  our revenues may be adversely impacted 
in addition  vessel classification societies also impose significant safety and other requirements on our vessels 
in complying with current and future environmental requirements  vessel owners and operators may also incur significant additional costs in meeting new maintenance and inspection requirements  in developing contingency arrangements for potential spills and in obtaining insurance coverage 
government regulation of vessels  particularly in the areas of safety and environmental requirements  can be expected to become stricter in the future and require us to incur significant capital expenditures on our vessels to keep them in compliance 
the operation of our vessels is also affected by other government regulation in the form of international conventions  national  state and local laws and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which the vessels operate  as well as in the country or countries of their registration 
because such conventions  laws  and regulations are often revised  we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with such conventions  laws and regulations or the impact thereof on the resale prices or useful lives of our vessels 
additional conventions  laws and regulations may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our doing business and which may materially adversely affect our operations 
we are required by various governmental and quasi governmental agencies to obtain certain permits  licenses  certificates  and financial assurances with respect to our operations 
increased inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business 
international shipping is subject to various security and customs inspection and related procedures in countries of origin and destination and trans shipment points 
inspection procedures may result in the seizure of contents of our vessels  delays in the loading  offloading  trans shipment or delivery and the levying of customs duties  fines or other penalties against us 
it is possible that changes to inspection procedures could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us 
changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may  in certain cases  render the shipment of certain types of cargo uneconomical or impractical 
any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with operating ocean going vessels could affect our business and reputation  which could adversely affect our revenues and stock price 
the operation of ocean going vessels carries inherent risks 
these risks include the possibility of marine disaster  environmental accidents  cargo and property losses or damage  business interruptions caused by mechanical failure  human error  war  terrorism  political action in various countries  labor strikes or adverse weather conditions  and piracy 
these hazards may result in death or injury to persons  loss of revenues or property  environmental damage  higher insurance rates  damage to our customer relationships  delay or rerouting 
if our vessels suffer damage  they may need to be repaired at a drydocking facility 
the costs of drydock repairs are unpredictable and may be substantial 
we may not have insurance that is sufficient to cover these costs or losses and may have to pay drydocking costs not covered by our insurance 
the loss of earnings while these vessels are being repaired and repositioned  as well as the actual cost of these repairs  would decrease our earnings and reduce the amount of cash that we have available for dividends 
in addition  space at drydocking facilities is sometimes limited and not all drydocking facilities are conveniently located 
we may be unable to find space at a suitable drydocking facility or our vessels may be forced to travel to a drydocking facility that is not conveniently located to our vessels positions 
any of these circumstances or events could increase our costs or lower our revenues 
the involvement of our vessels in an environmental disaster may harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator 
our business has inherent operational risks  which may not be adequately covered by insurance 
the operation of our has certain unique risks 
with a dry bulk carrier  the cargo itself and its interaction with the vessel can be an operational risk 
by their nature  dry bulk cargoes are often heavy  dense  easily shifted  and react badly to water exposure 
in addition  dry bulk carriers are often subjected to battering treatment during unloading operations with grabs  jackhammers to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold and small bulldozers 
this treatment may cause damage to the vessel 
vessels damaged due to treatment during unloading procedures may be more susceptible to breach to the sea 
hull breaches in dry bulk carriers may lead to the flooding of the vessels holds 
if a dry bulk carrier suffers flooding in its forward holds  the bulk cargo may become so dense and waterlogged that its pressure may buckle the vessel s bulkheads leading to the loss of a vessel 
if we are unable to adequately maintain our vessels we may be unable to prevent these events 
any of these circumstances or events could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and ability to pay dividends  if any  in the future 
in addition  the loss of any of our vessels could harm our reputation as a safe and reliable vessel owner and operator 
our vessels and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as marine disasters  bad weather  mechanical failures  human error  environmental accidents  war  terrorism  piracy and other circumstances or events 
in addition  transporting cargoes across a wide variety of international jurisdictions creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries  hostilities  labor strikes and boycotts  the potential for changes in tax rates or policies  and the potential for government expropriation of our vessels 
any of these events may result in loss of revenues  increased costs and decreased cash flows to our customers  which could impair their ability to make payments to us under our charters 
in the event of a casualty to a vessel or other catastrophic event  we will rely on our insurance to pay the insured value of the vessel or the damages incurred 
through our management agreements with our technical managers  we procure insurance for the vessels in our fleet employed under time charters against those risks that we believe the shipping industry commonly insures against 
these insurances include marine hull and machinery insurance  protection and indemnity insurance  which include pollution risks and crew insurances  and war risk insurance 
currently  the amount of coverage for liability for pollution  spillage and leakage available to us on commercially reasonable terms through protection and indemnity associations and providers of excess coverage is billion per vessel per occurrence 
we have procured hull and machinery insurance  protection and indemnity insurance  which includes environmental damage and pollution insurance coverage and war risk insurance for our fleet 
we do not maintain  for our vessels  insurance against loss of hire  which covers business interruptions that result from the loss of use of a vessel 
we may not be adequately insured against all risks 
we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our fleet in the future  and we may not be able to obtain certain insurance coverages  including insurance against charter party defaults  that we have obtained in the past on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
the insurers may not pay particular claims 
our insurance policies may contain deductibles for which we will be responsible and limitations and exclusions which may increase our costs or lower our revenue 
moreover  insurers may default on claims they are required to pay 
we cannot assure you that we will be adequately insured against all risks or that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for our vessels in the future 
for example  in the past more stringent environmental regulations have led to increased costs for  and in the future may result in the lack of availability of  insurance against risks of environmental damage or pollution 
additionally  our insurers may refuse to pay particular claims 
any significant loss or liability for which we are not insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
maritime claimants could arrest one or more of our vessels  which could interrupt our cash flow 
crew members  suppliers of goods and services to a vessel  shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts  claims or damages 
in many jurisdictions  a claimant may seek to obtain security for its claim by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings 
the arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt our cash flow and require us to pay large sums of money to have the arrest or attachment lifted 
in addition  in some jurisdictions  such as south africa  under the sister ship theory of liability  a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimant maritime lien and any associated vessel  which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner 
claimants could attempt to assert sister ship liability against one vessel in our fleet for claims relating to another of our vessels 
governments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency  resulting in a loss of earnings 
a government could requisition one or more of our vessels for title or for hire 
requisition for title occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and becomes her owner  while requisition for hire occurs when a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes her charterer at dictated charter rates 
generally  requisitions occur during periods of war or emergency  although governments may elect to requisition vessels in other circumstances 
although we would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of one or more of our vessels  the amount and timing of payment would be uncertain 
government requisition of one or more of our vessels may negatively impact our revenues 
failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act could result in fines  criminal penalties  drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business 
we may operate in a number of countries throughout the world  including countries known to have a reputation for corruption 
we are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti corruption laws and have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics which is consistent and in full compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act of the fcpa 
we are subject  however  to the risk that we  our affiliated entities or our or their respective officers  directors  employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of such anti corruption laws  including the fcpa 
any such violation could result in substantial fines  sanctions  civil and or criminal penalties  curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions  and might adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business 
furthermore  detecting  investigating  and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 
company specific risk factors the failure of our charterers to meet their obligations under our time charter agreements  on which we depend for substantially all of our revenues  could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business and ability to comply with covenants in our credit facilities 
the ability and willingness of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a time charter agreement with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include  among other things  general economic conditions  the condition of the dry bulk shipping industry and the overall financial condition of the counterparties 
charterers are sensitive to the commodity markets and may be impacted by market forces affecting commodities  such as iron ore  coal  grain  and other minor bulks 
in addition  in depressed market conditions  there have been reports of charterers  including some of our charter counterparties  defaulting on their obligations under charters  and our customers may fail to pay charter hire 
consistent with dry bulk shipping industry practice  we have not independently analyzed the creditworthiness of the charterers 
in addition  given the depressed market conditions  our charterers may no longer need a vessel that is currently under charter or may be able to obtain a comparable vessel at lower rates 
as a result  charterers may seek to renegotiate the terms of their existing charter parties or avoid their obligations under those contracts 
on january   klc the charterer for of our vessels filed for protective receivership in seoul  south korea 
we have temporarily taken back the employment of all affected chartered vessels and re chartered them out on the spot and short term time charter markets  pursuant to terms approved by the korean court 
earnings during this interim period were used to offset the charter hire otherwise due from klc 
on january   a comprehensive termination agreement between the company and klc became effective  pursuant to which we agreed to accept million on an installment note and  common shares of klc stock as compensation for the early termination of the charters with klc 
under the termination agreement  a payment of approximately million of the cash settlement was paid in the first quarter of  and the balance of million would have been paid in cash installments through  with the majority of the payments to be paid in the last five years 
the klc stock certificates were issued on february  and are now being secured at the korean securities depository until august   the date on which we would have been able to take possession of the share certificates 
on march   the korean court approved an amendment to klc rehabilitation plan after receiving a favorable vote from the concerned parties 
the amendment reduced our long term receivable from klc to million to be paid in cash installments through  discounted our existing shares by a to ratio  and converted the remainder of the long term receivable to shares that bring our holding of klc shares after the amendment to approximately 
we are evaluating what is the fair value of the common shares and the long term note receivable from klc and what the resulting settlement gain should be 
we have determined that the combined klc transactions will have a positive impact on our ebitda and have assessed a preliminary value of approximately million 
should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under its charter with us  it may be difficult to secure substitute employment for such vessel  and any new charter arrangements we secure in the spot market or on time charters would be at lower rates given currently decreased dry bulk carrier charter rate levels 
if our charterers fail to meet their obligations to us or attempt to renegotiate our charter agreements  we could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  if any  in the future  and compliance with covenants in our credit facilities  certain of which specifically require the maintenance of minimum charter rate levels 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to borrow amounts under our credit facility and restrictive covenants in our credit facility may impose financial and other restrictions on us our fourth amended and restated credit agreement   which is secured by mortgages on the vessels in our fleet  requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including the requirements that we maintain i a maximum leverage ratio of the term loan indebtedness  excluding the payment in kind loans  to ebitda as defined in the credit facility beginning with the third quarter of  ii a minimum interest rate coverage ratio of ebitda to cash interest expenses beginning with the second quarter of  iii free cash as of the last day of each financial quarter  and iv a maximum collateral coverage ratio of the aggregate of of the term loan and any related swap exposure to the market value of the vessels mortgaged under the facility beginning with the third quarter of a violation of any of these covenants constitutes an event of default under the credit facility that  if not waived by our lenders  provides our lenders with the right to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facility immediately due and payable and foreclose their liens on our vessels 
if the amounts outstanding under our credit facility were to be become accelerated or were to become the subject of foreclosure actions  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders 
for more information on the fourth amended and restated credit agreement  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources 
the fourth amended and restated credit agreement also imposes operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions may limit our ability to  among other things pay dividends or make other payments to our shareholders  or redeem any of our common stock  change our chief executive officer without the approval of our lender  amend or supplement  or waive or forebear from enforcing  certain charters  incur additional indebtedness  make loans or investments  acquire assets outside of the ordinary course of our business  acquire assets outside of the ordinary course of our business  change the flag  class or management of our vessels  create liens on our assets  sell  lease  transfer or otherwise dispose of our assets  merge or consolidate with another person  enter into a new line of business  enter into transactions with affiliates  and enter into a time charter or consecutive voyage charters that has a term that exceeds  or which by virtue of any optional extensions may exceed  months 
in addition  we may not pay dividends if the collateral coverage ratio on the last day of such fiscal quarter is or more  there is a default or a breach of a loan covenant under the credit facility or if the payment of the dividends would result in a default or breach of a loan covenant under the credit facility or the amount of the dividends would exceed the amount of cumulative free cash required to be maintained under the credit facility 
our indebtedness may also be accelerated if we experience a change of control 
therefore  we may need to seek permission from our lender in order to engage in some corporate actions 
our lender interests may be different from ours and we cannot guarantee you that we will be able to obtain our lender permission when needed 
this may limit our ability to pay dividends to you  finance our future operations  make acquisitions or pursue business opportunities 
furthermore  if we further amend the credit facility or enter into any additional debt instruments in the future  our lenders may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions may further restrict our ability to  among other things  fund our operations or capital needs  make acquisitions or pursue available business opportunities  which in turn may adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  our lenders may require the payment of additional fees  require prepayment of a portion of our indebtedness to them  accelerate the amortization schedule for our indebtedness and increase the interest rates they charge us on our outstanding indebtedness 
we are dependent on spot charters and any decrease in spot charter rates in the future may adversely affect our earnings and our ability to pay dividends we currently operate a fleet of owned vessels  of which vessels were employed for less than one year as of december   exposing us to fluctuations in spot market charter rates 
historically  the dry bulk market has been volatile as a result of the many conditions and factors that can affect the price  supply and demand for dry bulk capacity 
the recent global economic crisis may further reduce demand for transportation of dry bulk cargoes over longer distances and supply of dry bulk vessels to carry such dry bulk cargoes  which may materially affect our revenues  profitability and cash flows 
the spot charter market may fluctuate significantly based upon supply of and demand for vessels and cargoes 
the successful operation of our vessels in the competitive spot charter market depends upon  among other things  obtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing  to the extent possible  time spent waiting for charters and time spent traveling unladen to pick up cargo 
the spot market is very volatile  and  in the past  there have been periods when spot rates have declined below the operating cost of vessels 
if future spot charter rates decline  then we may be unable to operate our vessels trading in the spot market profitably  meet our obligations  including payments on indebtedness  or to pay dividends  if any  in the future 
furthermore  as charter rates for spot charters are fixed for a single voyage  which may last up to several weeks  during periods in which spot charter rates are rising  we will generally experience delays in realizing the benefits from such increases 
our ability to renew the charters on our vessels on the expiration or termination of our current charters  including the charters scheduled to expire in as of december   and the charter rates payable under any such replacement charters  will depend upon  among other things  economic conditions in the sectors in which our vessels operate at that time  changes in the supply of and demand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply of and demand for the seaborne transportation of energy resources 
we cannot assure you that our board of directors will declare dividends 
commencing with the fourth quarter of  our board of directors determined to suspend the payment of a dividend to our shareholders to increase cash flow  optimize financial flexibility and enhance internal growth 
in the future  the declaration and payment of dividends  if any  will always be subject to the discretion of our board of directors  restrictions contained in our credit facility and the requirements of marshall islands law 
the timing and amount of any dividends declared will depend on  among other things  our earnings  financial condition and cash requirements and availability  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as contemplated by our growth strategy  the terms of our outstanding indebtedness and the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us 
the international dry bulk shipping industry is highly volatile  and we cannot predict with certainty the amount of cash  if any  that will be available for distribution as dividends in any period 
also  there may be a high degree of variability from period to period in the amount of cash that is available for the payment of dividends 
we may incur expenses or liabilities or be subject to other circumstances in the future that reduce or eliminate the amount of cash that we have available for distribution as dividends  including as a result of the risks described in this annual report 
our growth strategy contemplates that we will finance our acquisitions of additional vessels through debt financings or the net proceeds of future equity issuances on terms acceptable to us 
if financing is not available to us on acceptable terms  our board of directors may determine to finance or refinance acquisitions with cash from operations  which would reduce the amount of any cash available for the payment of dividends 
under the terms of our credit facility  we will not be permitted to pay dividends if there is a default or a breach of a loan covenant 
in addition  we are permitted to pay dividends only in amounts up to our cumulative cash flows which is ebitda as defined in our credit agreement less the aggregate amount of interest incurred and net amounts payable under interest rate hedging agreements during the relevant period and an agreed upon reserve for drydockings 
please see the section of this annual report entitled credit facility for more information relating to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under the terms of our credit facility 
the republic of marshall islands laws generally prohibits the payment of dividends other than from surplus retained earnings and the excess of consideration received for the sale of shares above the par value of the shares or while a company is insolvent or would be rendered insolvent by the payment of such a dividend 
we may not have sufficient surplus in the future to pay dividends and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds or surplus to make distributions to us 
we can give no assurance that dividends will be paid at all 
we may have difficulty managing our planned growth properly 
the acquisition and management of the vessels in our operating fleet have imposed  and additional dry bulk vessels that we may acquire in the future will impose  significant responsibilities on our management and staff 
the addition of vessels to our fleet may require us to increase the number of our personnel 
further  we have recently commenced providing technical management services to certain of our vessels in house and expect to provide these services to additional vessels in our fleet 
we will also have to manage our customer base so that we can provide continued employment for our vessels upon the expiration of our existing time charters 
we intend to continue to grow our business 
our future growth will primarily depend on locating and acquiring suitable vessels  obtaining required financing on acceptable terms  identifying and consummating acquisitions or joint ventures  enhancing our customer base  and managing our expansion 
growing any business by acquisition presents numerous risks  such as undisclosed liabilities and obligations  the possibility that indemnification agreements will be unenforceable or insufficient to cover potential losses and difficulties associated with imposing common standards  controls  procedures and policies  obtaining additional qualified personnel  managing relationships with customers and integrating newly acquired assets and operations into existing infrastructure 
we cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in executing our growth plans or that we will not incur significant expenses and losses in connection with our future growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance indebtedness incurred under our credit facility 
our business strategy contemplates that we repay all or a portion of our acquisition related debt from time to time with the net proceeds of equity issuances 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness through equity offerings or otherwise on terms that are acceptable to us or at all 
if we are not able to refinance our indebtedness  we will have to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay the principal and interest of this indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts that are sufficient for these purposes 
if we are not able to satisfy these obligations  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans or sell our assets 
the actual or perceived credit quality of our charterers  any defaults by them  and the market value of our fleet  among other things  may materially affect our ability to obtain alternative financing 
in addition  debt service payments under our credit facility or alternative financing may limit funds otherwise available for working capital  capital expenditures  payment of dividends and other purposes 
if we are unable to meet our debt obligations  or if we otherwise default under our credit facility or an alternative financing arrangement  our lender could declare the debt  together with accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on our fleet  which could result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have at such time and the commencement of similar foreclosure proceedings by other lenders 
if we are not able to borrow under our credit facility and are unable to find alternative sources of financing on terms that are acceptable to us or at all  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected 
purchasing and operating secondhand vessels may result in increased operating costs and reduced fleet utilization 
while we have the right to inspect previously owned vessels prior to purchase  such an inspection does not provide us with the same knowledge about their condition that we would have if these vessels had been built for and operated exclusively by us 
a secondhand vessel may have conditions or defects that we were not aware of when we bought the vessel and which may require us to incur costly repairs to the vessel 
these repairs may require us to put a vessel into dry dock  which would reduce our fleet utilization 
furthermore  we usually do not receive the benefit of warranties on secondhand vessels 
we are subject to certain risks with respect to our counterparties on contracts  and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business 
we have entered into and may enter into in the future  among other things  charter parties with our customers  credit facilities with banks and interest rate swap agreements 
such agreements subject us to counterparty risks 
the ability of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include  among other things  general economic conditions  the condition of the maritime industry  the overall financial condition of the counterparty  charter rates received for specific types of vessels  the supply and demand for commodities such as iron ore  coal  grain  and other minor bulks and various expenses 
should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under agreements with us  we could sustain significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we depend upon a few significant customers for a large part of our revenues and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our financial performance 
we derive a significant part of our revenues from a small number of charterers 
in  two customers individually accounted for more than of our time charter revenue 
the charterers payments to us under their charters are our sole source of revenue 
some of our charterers are privately owned companies for which limited credit and financial information was available to us in making our assessment of counterparty risk when we entered into our charter 
in addition  the ability of each of our charterers to perform its obligations under a charter will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors may include general economic conditions  the condition of the dry bulk shipping industry  the charter rates received for specific types of vessels and various operating expenses 
if one or more of these charterers terminates its charter or chooses not to re charter our vessel or is unable to perform under its charter with us and we are not able to find a replacement charter  we could suffer a loss of revenues that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution as dividends to our shareholders 
in addition  we may be required to change the flagging or registration of the related vessel and may incur additional costs  including maintenance and crew costs if a charterer were to default on its obligations 
our shareholders do not have any recourse against our charterers 
in the highly competitive international shipping industry  we may not be able to compete for charters with new entrants or established companies with greater resources  and as a result  we may be unable to employ our vessels profitably 
our vessels are employed in a highly competitive market that is capital intensive and highly fragmented 
competition arises primarily from other vessel owners  some of whom have substantially greater resources than we do 
competition for the transportation of dry bulk cargo by sea is intense and depends on price  location  size  age  condition and the acceptability of the vessel and its operators to the charterers 
due in part to the highly fragmented market  competitors with greater resources could enter the dry bulk shipping industry and operate larger fleets through consolidations or acquisitions and may be able to offer lower charter rates and higher quality vessels than we are able to offer 
if we are unable to successfully compete with other dry bulk shipping companies  our results of operations would be adversely impacted 
we may be unable to attract and retain key management personnel and other employees in the shipping industry  which may negatively impact the effectiveness of our management and results of operations 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of our management team 
we have entered into an employment contract with our chairman and chief executive officer  sophocles zoullas 
our success will depend upon our ability to retain key members of our management team and to hire new members as may be necessary 
the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition 
difficulty in hiring and retaining replacement personnel could have a similar effect 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our officers 
the aging of our fleet may result in increased operating costs in the future  which could adversely affect our earnings 
in general  the cost of maintaining a vessel in good operating condition increases with the age of the vessel 
although the weighted average age of the dry bulk vessels in our operating fleet as of december  was approximately six years  as our fleet ages  we will incur increased costs 
older vessels are typically less fuel efficient and more costly to maintain than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine technology 
cargo insurance rates increase with the age of a vessel  making older vessels less desirable to charterers 
governmental regulations and safety or other equipment standards related to the age of vessels may also require expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment  to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which our vessels may engage 
we cannot assure you that  as our vessels age  market conditions will justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives 
technological innovation could reduce our charter hire income and the value of our vessels 
the charter hire rates and the value and operational life of a vessel are determined by a number of factors including the vessel efficiency  operational flexibility and physical life 
efficiency includes speed  fuel economy and the ability to load and discharge cargo quickly 
flexibility includes the ability to enter harbors  utilize related docking facilities and pass through canals and straits 
the length of a vessel physical life is related to its original design and construction  its maintenance and the impact of the stress of operations 
if new dry bulk carriers are built that are more efficient or more flexible or have longer physical lives than our vessels  competition from these more technologically advanced vessels could adversely affect the amount of charterhire payments we receive for our vessels once their initial charters expire and the resale value of our vessels could significantly decrease 
as a result  our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may be subject to litigation that  if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be  from time to time  involved in various litigation matters 
these matters may include  among other things  contract disputes  personal injury claims  environmental claims or proceedings  asbestos and other toxic tort claims  employment matters  governmental claims for taxes or duties  and other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business 
although we intend to defend these matters vigorously  we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or other litigation matter  and the ultimate outcome of any litigation or the potential costs to resolve them may have a material adverse effect on us 
insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases and or insurers may not remain solvent which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we may have to pay tax on united states source income  which would reduce our earnings 
under the united states internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  of the gross shipping income of a vessel owning or chartering corporation  such as ourselves and our subsidiaries  that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends  but that does not both begin and end  in the united states is characterized as united states source shipping income and such income is subject to a united states federal income tax without allowance for any deductions  unless that corporation qualifies for exemption from tax under section of the code and the treasury regulations promulgated thereunder 
we believe that we and each of our subsidiaries qualify for this statutory tax exemption and we will take this position for united states federal income tax return reporting purposes 
however  there are factual circumstances beyond our control that could cause us to lose the benefit of this tax exemption after the offering and thereby cause us to become subject to united states federal income tax on our united states source shipping income 
for example  there is a risk that we could no longer qualify for exemption under section of the code for a particular taxable year if other shareholders with a five percent or greater interest in our stock were  in combination with to own or more of our outstanding shares of our stock on more than half the days during the taxable year 
due to the factual nature of the issues involved  we can give no assurances on our tax exempt status or that of any of our subsidiaries 
in addition  changes in the code  the treasury regulations or the interpretation thereof by the internal revenue service or the courts could adversely affect our ability to take advantage of the exemption under section if we are not entitled to this exemption under section for any taxable year  we would be subject for such taxable year to a united states federal income tax on our united states source shipping income 
the imposition of this taxation could have a negative effect on our business and would result in decreased earnings available for distribution to our stockholders 
based on the current operation of our vessels  if we were subject to this tax  our united states federal income tax liability would be approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because the operations of our vessels are under the control of third party charterers  we can give no assurance that our united states federal income tax liability would be substantially higher 
however  since no more that of our shipping income would be treated as derived from us sources  our maximum tax liability under the tax regime would never exceed of our shipping income 
united states tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company  which could have adverse united states federal income tax consequences to united states holders 
a foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for united states federal income tax purposes if either at least of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income or at least of the average value of the corporation assets produce or are held for the production of those types of passive income 
for purposes of these tests  passive income includes dividends  interest  and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business 
for purposes of these tests  income derived from the performance of services does not constitute passive income 
united states stockholders of a pfic are subject to a disadvantageous united states federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the pfic  the distributions they receive from the pfic and the gain  if any  they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the pfic 
based on our current method of operation  we do not believe that we have been  are or will be a pfic with respect to any taxable year 
in this regard  we intend to treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time chartering activities as services income  rather than rental income 
accordingly  we believe that our income from our time chartering activities does not constitute passive income  and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets 
there is  however  no direct legal authority under the pfic rules addressing our method of operation 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the united states internal revenue service  or irs  or a court of law will accept our position  and there is a risk that the irs or a court of law could determine that we are a pfic 
moreover  no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a pfic for any future taxable year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations 
if the irs were to find that we are or have been a pfic for any taxable year  our united states stockholders would face adverse united states tax consequences and information reporting obligations 
under the pfic rules  unless those stockholders made an election available under the code which election could itself have adverse consequences for such stockholders  as discussed below under united states federal income taxation of united states holders  such stockholders would be liable to pay united states federal income tax upon excess distributions and upon any gain from the disposition of our common stock at the then prevailing income tax rates applicable to ordinary income plus interest as if the excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the stockholder holding period of our common stock 
please see the section of this form k entitled tax considerations united states federal income taxation of united states holders for a more comprehensive discussion of the united states federal income tax consequences to united states stockholders if we are treated as a pfic 
we are a holding company  and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments 
we are a holding company and our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own all of our operating assets 
we have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries 
as a result  our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and to make dividend payments in the future depends on our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us 
if we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries  our board of directors may exercise its discretion not to declare or pay dividends 
we do not intend to obtain funds from other sources to pay dividends 
as we expand our business  we may need to improve our operating and financial systems and will need to recruit suitable employees and crew for our vessels 
our current operating and financial systems may not be adequate as we implement our plan to expand the size of our fleet and our attempts to improve those systems may be ineffective 
in addition  if we further expand our fleet  we will need to recruit suitable additional seafarers and shore side administrative and management personnel 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire suitable employees as we expand our fleet 
if we or our crewing agent encounters business or financial difficulties  we may not be able to adequately staff our vessels 
if we are unable to grow our financial and operating systems or to recruit suitable employees as we expand our fleet  our financial performance may be adversely affected and  among other things  the amount of cash available for distribution as dividends to our stockholders may be reduced 
investment in derivative instruments  such as forward freight and swap agreements  could result in losses 
from time to time  we may take positions in derivative instruments  including freight forward agreements ffas 
ffas and other derivative instruments may be used to hedge a vessel owner exposure to the charter market by providing for the sale of a contracted charter rate along a specified route and period of time 
upon settlement  if the contracted charter rate is less than the average of the rates  as reported by an identified index  for the specified route and period  the seller of the ffa is required to pay the buyer an amount equal to the difference between the contracted rate and the settlement rate  multiplied by the number of days in the specified period 
conversely  if the contracted rate is greater than the settlement rate  the buyer is required to pay the seller the settlement sum 
if we take positions in ffas or other derivative instruments and do not correctly anticipate charter rate movements over the specified route and time period  we could suffer losses in the settling or termination of the ffa 
this could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  we have entered into interest rate swaps effectively convert a portion of our debt from a floating to a fixed rate basis 
under these swap contracts  exclusive of applicable margins  we pay fixed rate interest and receive floating rate interest amounts based on three month libor settings 
the swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
our hedging strategies  however  may not be effective and we may incur substantial losses if interest rates move materially differently from our expectations 
in addition  our financial condition could be materially adversely affected to the extent we do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations under our financing arrangements 
any hedging activities we engage in may not effectively manage our interest rate exposure or have the desired impact on our financial conditions or results of operations 
at december   the fair value of our interest rate swaps was a liability of million 
if the recent volatility in libor continues  it could affect our profitability  earnings and cash flow 
libor has recently been volatile  with the spread between libor and the prime lending rate widening significantly at times 
these conditions are the result of the recent disruptions in the international credit markets 
because the interest rate borne by our outstanding indebtedness fluctuates with changes in libor  if this volatility were to continue  it would affect the amount of interest payable on our debt  which in turn  could have an adverse effect on our profitability  earnings and cash flow 
furthermore  interest in most loan agreements in our industry has been based on published libor rates 
recently  however  lenders have insisted on provisions that entitle the lenders  in their discretion  to replace published libor as the base for the interest calculation with their cost of funds rate 
if we are required to agree to such a provision in future loan agreements  our lending costs could increase significantly  which would have an adverse effect on our profitability  earnings and cash flow 
risks relating to our common stock we are incorporated in the marshall islands  which does not have a well developed body of corporate law 
our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and by the marshall islands business corporations act the bca 
the provisions of the bca resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states 
however  there have been few judicial cases in the marshall islands interpreting the bca 
the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under the laws of the marshall islands are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in the united states 
the rights of stockholders of companies incorporated in the marshall islands may differ from the rights of stockholders of companies incorporated in the united states 
while the bca provides that it is to be interpreted according to the laws of the state of delaware and other states with substantially similar legislative provisions  there have been few  if any  court cases interpreting the bca in the marshall islands and we can t predict whether marshall islands courts would reach the same conclusions as united states courts 
thus  you may have more difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management  directors or controlling stockholders than would stockholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction which has developed a relatively more substantial body of case law 
the market price of our common shares has fluctuated widely and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the market price of our common shares has fluctuated widely since we became a public company in june and may continue to do so as a result of many factors  including our actual results of operations and perceived prospects  the prospects of our competition and of the shipping industry in general and in particular the dry bulk sector  differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  changes in general valuations for companies in the shipping industry  particularly the dry bulk sector  changes in general economic or market conditions and broad market fluctuations 
the price of our common stock has dropped below per share  and the last reported closing price on the nasdaq global select market on march  was per share 
as long as the market price of our common shares remains below per share  under stock exchange rules  our shareholders will not be able to use such shares as collateral for borrowing in margin accounts 
this inability to use our common shares as collateral may depress demand as certain institutional investors are restricted from investing in shares priced below and lead to sales of such shares creating downward pressure on and increased volatility in the market price of our common shares 
the public market for our common shares may not continue to be active and liquid enough for you to resell our common shares in the future 
we cannot assure you that an active or liquid public market for our common stock will continue 
since  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
if the volatility in the market continues or worsens  it could continue to have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and could impact a potential sale price if holders of our common stock decide to sell their shares 
the seaborne transportation industry has been highly unpredictable and volatile 
the market for common shares in this industry may be equally volatile 
the market price of our common shares may be influenced by many factors  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in our industry  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions or capital commitments  mergers and strategic alliances in the shipping industry  terrorist acts  future sales of our common shares or other securities  market conditions in the shipping industry  economic and regulatory trends  shortfalls in our operating results from levels forecast by securities analysts  announcements concerning us or our competitors  the general state of the securities market  and investors perception of us and the dry bulk shipping industry 
as a result of these and other factors  investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for such shares 
these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common shares  regardless of our operating performance 
future sales of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  may depress the market price for our common stock 
these sales could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities in the future 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize us to issue  shares of common stock  of which  shares were issued and outstanding as of december  we intend to issue additional shares of our common stock in the future 
our shareholders may incur dilution from any future equity offering and upon the issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon the exercise of options we have granted to certain of our executive officers or upon the issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plan 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents  as well as our shareholder rights plan  could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition  or could make it difficult for our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
several provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year  preventing them from changing the composition of management 
in addition  the same provisions  as well as our shareholder rights plan  may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable 
these provisions will include authorizing our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  authorizing vacancies on our board of directors to be filled only by a vote of the majority of directors then in office and specifically denying our stockholders the right to fill vacancies on the board  establishing certain advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  authorizing the removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote for the directors  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and establishing supermajority voting provisions with respect to amendments to certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws 
in addition to the provision described above  on november   our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right right for each outstanding share of our common stock to shareholders of record on the close of business on november  each right is nominally exercisable  upon the occurrence of certain events  for one one thousandth of a share of series a junior participating preferred stock  par value 
per share  at a purchase price of per unit  subject to adjustment and additional shares of our common stock 
the rights may further discourage a third party from making an unsolicited proposal to acquire us  as exercise of the rights would cause substantial dilution to such third party attempting to acquire us 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control and  as a result  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and your ability to realize any potential change of control premium

the complaint seeks rescission of director and officer compensation for those years as well as rescission of the management agreement  and seeks unspecified damages 
the discovery period in this action has concluded and summary judgment motions are due april  on august  and august   respectively  two additional complaints were filed in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county against the company board of directors and a former director alleging substantially similar breaches of fiduciary duties as those alleged in the lawsuit filed on june  on january   a motion by the company was granted  which stays these state court actions pending the outcome of the june  federal action 
those matters remain stayed 
on october   a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york by one of the plaintiffs in the june  federal action against the company and its board of directors alleging deficiencies in the company proxy statement in connection with its special meeting of shareholders that was held on november  the company revised its proxy statement prior to the meeting  causing plaintiffs to withdraw a request for injunctive relief in connection with their complaint 
the company served an answer in this action on march  korea line corporation on january   klc  one of our charterers  filed for protective receivership in seoul  south korea 
on february   the korean courts approved this request 
for the period february  through march   the company took over the employment of the majority of the affected chartered vessels and re chartered out all affected vessels on the spot and short term time charter markets 
earnings during this interim period were used to offset the charter hire otherwise due from klc 
on march   the company reached a comprehensive agreement with the receivers of klc regarding the twelve time chartered vessels impacted by klc decision to file for protective receivership earlier this year 
on may  and july  the company took delivery of two newbuilding vessels that were originally chartered to klc 
on october  the joint receivers certified klc rehabilitation plans 
on january   a comprehensive termination agreement between the company and klc became effective  pursuant to which we agreed to accept million on an installment note and  common shares of klc stock as compensation for the early termination of the charters with klc 
under the termination agreement  a payment of approximately million of the cash settlement was paid in the first quarter of  and the balance of million would have been paid in cash installments through  with the majority of the payments to be paid in the last five years 
the klc stock certificates were issued on february  and are now being secured at the korean securities depository until august   the date on which we would have been able to take possession of the share certificates 
on march   the korean court approved an amendment to klc rehabilitation plan after receiving a favorable vote from the concerned parties 
the amendment reduced our long term receivable from klc to million to be paid in cash installments through  discounted our existing shares by a to ratio  and converted the remainder of the long term receivable to shares that bring our holding of klc shares after the amendment to approximately 
we are evaluating what is the fair value of the common shares and the long term note receivable from klc and what the resulting settlement gain should be 
we have determined that the combined klc transactions will have a positive impact on our ebitda and have assessed a preliminary value of approximately million 
additional information about legal proceedings described above is set forth in note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
from time to time  we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business  principally personal injury and property casualty claims 
those claims  even if lacking merit  could result in the expenditure by us of significant financial and managerial resources

overview we are eagle bulk shipping inc  a republic of marshall islands corporation headquartered in new york city 
we own one of the largest fleets of supramax dry bulk vessels in the world 
supramax dry bulk are handymax vessels ranging in size from  to  dwt 
we transport a broad range of major and minor bulk cargoes  including iron ore  coal  grain  cement and fertilizer  along worldwide shipping routes 
as of december   we owned and operated a modern fleet of handymax segment dry bulk vessels  of which are of the supramax class 
we are focused on maintaining a high quality fleet that is concentrated primarily in one vessel type handymax dry bulk carriers and its sub category of supramax vessels 
these vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility of on board cranes while offering cargo carrying capacities approaching that of panamax dry bulk vessels  which range in size from  to  dwt and rely on port facilities to load and offload their cargoes 
we believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the supramax class vessels make them attractive to cargo interests and vessel charterers 
the vessels in our operating fleet  with an aggregate carrying capacity of  deadweight tons  have an average age of only six years compared to an average age for the world handymax dry bulk fleet of approximately ten years 
on june   we entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement with the royal bank of scotland plc  as agent  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and liquidity and capital resources below 
on may   we completed a one for four reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock  as previously approved by our shareholders at the special meeting of shareholders held in november proportional adjustments were made to our issued and outstanding common stock and to our common stock underlying stock options and other common stock based equity grants outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the reverse stock split 
our financial performance is based on the following key elements of our business strategy concentration in one vessel category supramax class of handymax dry bulk vessels  which we believe offer size  operational and geographical advantages over other classes of dry bulk vessels  such as panamax and capesize vessels  our strategy is to balance between mid term time charters and revenues generated by short term time charters and voyage charters to maximize our financial performance throughout shipping cycles 
we have entered into time and voyage charter employment contracts for all the vessels in our operating fleet 
we charter some of our vessels pursuant to one to two year time charters to allow us to take advantage of the stable cash flow and high utilization rates that are associated with medium term time charters 
the vessels that are on charters whose revenues are linked to the baltic supramax index generally have durations of one year or less 
these index linked charters and voyage charters provide us with the revenue upside as the market improves 
we believe that this structure provides significant visibility to our future financial results and allows us to take advantage of the stable cash flows and high utilization rates that are associated with medium term time charters  while at the same time providing us with the revenue upside potential from the index linked or short term time charters or voyage charters 
all the charters provide for fixed semi monthly payments in advance 
while we remain focused on securing charters with fixed base rates  we have also entered into contracts with fixed minimum rates and profit sharing arrangements  enabling us to benefit from an increasing rate environment while still minimizing downside risk 
we regularly monitor the dry bulk shipping market and based on market conditions we may consider taking advantage of long term charter rates  maintain high quality vessels and improve standards of operation through improved environmental procedures  crew training and maintenance and repair procedures  and maintain a balance between purchasing vessels as market conditions and opportunities arise and maintaining prudent financial ratios eg leverage ratio

market overview the international shipping industry is highly competitive and fragmented with many market participants as of january  there are approximately  dry bulk carriers over  dwt totaling million dwt 
the world dry bulk fleet remains very fragmented with no single owner accounting for more than in any particular sub sector 
we compete with other primarily private owners of dry bulk vessels in the handysize  handymax  and panamax asset classes 
competition in drybulk trade is intense 
demand is a function of world economic conditions and the consequent requirement for commodities  production and consumption patterns  as well as events which interrupt production  trade routes  and consumption 
we compete for charters on the basis of price  vessel location  size  age  and condition  as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator 
customers  or charterers  tend to prefer modern vessels over older ships due to their greater operational reliability  lower fuel consumption  and improved built designs complying with more recent regulation standards 
consequently  owners of large modern fleets tend to have a competitive advantage over owners operating older ships 
our strategy is to concentrate in one vessel category within the dry bulk segment the handymax sector 
handymax dry bulk vessels range in size from  to  dwt 
within the handymax sector  the industry has migrated to a larger size vessel class called the supramax which ranges in size from  to  dwt 
these vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility offered by its on board cranes while its cargo carrying capacity approaches that of panamax class vessels  which ranges in size between  and  dwt and requires onshore facilities to load and offload their cargoes 
we believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the supramax class vessels make them attractive to potential charterers 
forty three of the vessels in our operating fleet as of december  are classified as supramax vessels 
the supply of dry bulk vessels depends primarily on the level of the orderbook  the fleet age profile  and the operating efficiency of the existing fleet 
as of january  of the world handymax fleet was years or older 
the handymax vessels in our operating fleet have an average age of approximately six years as of december   compared to an average age for the world handymax dry bulk fleet of approximately ten years 
the handymax newbuilding orderbook currently stands at of the world handymax fleet 
the handymax market drybulk shipping experienced a challenging year in as net supply growth exceeded demand 
was a record year for scrapping  but it was not enough to absorb peak orderbook deliveries 
as a result  net supply grew by over 
global trade demand grew by a respectable due to a continued appetite for commodities  including coal  grain  iron ore  and other minor bulks 
rates weakened across all asset classes in handymax rates decreased to an average  per day  panamax rates decreased to an average  per day  and capesize rates decreased to average  per day 
the outperformance by the handymax segment can be attributed to better supply demand fundamentals and to its ability to carry a diversified cargo mix as compared to the larger vessels 
industry research indicates estimated dry bulk vessel deliveries for and beyond will be million dwt 
it is widely believed that a material amount of these scheduled deliveries will not materialize due to a variety of reasons  including inflated orderbook figures  owner and yard related financing issues  and increasing labor cost and appreciating currency issues for yards 
demand for dry bulk is expected to remain strong in with growth expected to reach over in the capesize sector  over vessels are on order which is equivalent to approximately of existing fleet 
the panamax sector has about of its existing fleet on order 
the handymax sector has about of its existing fleet on order with the bulk of deliveries occurring in however  the sub panamax fleet is older with a considerable proportion of the trading fleet over years of age allowing for another potential record year for scrapping 
lack of historical operating data for vessels before their acquisition consistent with shipping industry practice  other than inspection of the physical condition of the vessels and examinations of classification society records  there is no historical financial due diligence process when we acquire vessels 
accordingly  we do not obtain the historical operating data for the vessels from the sellers because that information is not material to our decision to make acquisitions  nor do we believe it would be helpful to potential investors in our common stock in assessing our business or profitability 
most vessels are sold under a standardized agreement  which  among other things  provides the buyer with the right to inspect the vessel and the vessel classification society records 
the standard agreement does not give the buyer the right to inspect  or receive copies of  the historical operating data of the vessel 
prior to the delivery of a purchased vessel  the seller typically removes from the vessel all records  including past financial records and accounts related to the vessel 
in addition  the technical management agreement between the seller technical manager and the seller is automatically terminated and the vessel trading certificates are revoked by its flag state following a change in ownership 
consistent with shipping industry practice  we treat the acquisition of a vessel whether acquired with or without charter as the acquisition of an asset rather than a business 
although vessels are generally acquired free of charter  we have acquired and may in the future acquire some vessels with time charters 
where a vessel has been under a voyage charter  the vessel is delivered to the buyer free of charter  and it is rare in the shipping industry for the last charterer of the vessel in the hands of the seller to continue as the first charterer of the vessel in the hands of the buyer 
in most cases  when a vessel is under time charter and the buyer wishes to assume that charter  the vessel cannot be acquired without the charterer consent and the buyer entering into a separate direct agreement with the charterer to assume the charter 
the purchase of a vessel itself does not transfer the charter  because it is a separate service agreement between the vessel owner and the charterer 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap or gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies  because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application 
for a description of all our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition revenues are generated from time charters and voyage charters 
time charter revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective time charter agreements as service is provided 
voyage revenues for cargo transportation are recognized ratably over the estimated relative transit time of each voyage 
voyage revenue is deemed to commence upon the completion of discharge of the previous charterer s cargo and is deemed to end upon the completion of discharge of the current cargo  provided an agreed non cancelable charter between the company and the charterer is in existence  the charter rate is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue under voyage charters will not be recognized until a charter has been agreed even if the vessel has discharged its previous cargo and is proceeding to an anticipated port of loading 
revenues generated from time charters linked to the baltic supramax index and or revenues generated from profit sharing arrangements are recognized over the term of the respective time charter agreements as service is provided and the profit sharing is fixed and determinable 
vessel lives and impairment the carrying value of each of our vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation 
we depreciate our dry bulk vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual salvage value 
salvage  or scrap  value is based upon a vessel lightweight tonnage lwt multiplied by a scrap rate 
we use a scrap rate of per lwt  to compute each vessel salvage value 
however  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  the vessel useful life is adjusted to end at the date such regulations become effective 
an increase in the useful life of a dry bulk vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
a decrease in the useful life of a dry bulk vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
the carrying values of the company vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings 
historically  both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical 
we evaluate the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  we review certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  vessel sales and purchases  business plans and overall market conditions 
during the past few years  the market values of vessels have experienced particular volatility  with substantial declines in many vessel classes 
as a result  the charter free market value  or basic market value  of certain of our vessels may have declined below those vessels carrying value 
when indicators of impairment are present and our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows for any vessel is lower than the vessel s carrying value  the carrying value is written down  by recording a charge to operations  to the vessel s fair market value if the fair market value is lower than the vessel s carrying value 
we also experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization  which is below our equity book value 
we concluded at december  that the future income streams expected to be earned by our vessels over their remaining operating lives on an undiscounted basis would be sufficient to recover their carrying values and that accordingly  our vessels were not impaired under us gaap 
our estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded each of our vessels carrying values by a considerable margin 
management will continue to monitor developments in charter rates in the markets in which it participates with respect to the expectation of future rates over an extended period of time that are utilized in the analyses 
we determine undiscounted projected net operating cash flow for each vessel and compare it to the vessel carrying value 
this assessment is made at the individual vessel level since separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available 
in developing estimates of future cash flows  the company must make assumptions about future charter rates  ship operating expenses  and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels 
these assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations 
specifically  we utilize the rates currently in effect for the duration of their current time charters  without assuming additional profit sharing 
for periods of time where our vessels are not fixed on time charters  we utilize an estimated daily time charter equivalent for our vessels unfixed days based on the last twenty years of historical average of one to three years time charter 
actual equivalent drybulk shipping rates are currently lower than the estimated rate 
we believe current rates have been driven by short term disruptions in demand and a slowdown in the availability of global credit 
the projected net operating cash flows are determined by considering the future charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days and an estimated daily time charter equivalent for the unfixed days over the estimated remaining life of the vessel  assumed to be years from the delivery of the vessel from the shipyard  reduced by brokerage commissions  expected outflows for vessels maintenance and vessel operating expenses including planned drydocking and special survey expenditures and capital expenditures adjusted annually for inflation 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
there can be no assurance as to how long charter rates and vessel values will remain at their currently low levels or whether they will improve by any significant degree 
charter rates may remain at depressed levels for some time  which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability  and future assessments of vessel impairment 
in the event that an impairment were to occur  we would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset carrying value to the estimated fair value 
we estimate fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations performed on an individual vessel basis 
such valuation is not necessarily the same as the amount any vessel may bring upon sale  which may be more or less  and should not be relied upon as such 
the table set forth below indicates the carrying value of each of our vessels as of december   where we believe has a basic market value below its carrying value  and the aggregate difference between carrying value and basic market value represented by such vessels 
this aggregate difference represents the approximate analysis of the amount by which we believe we would have to reduce our net income if we sold all of such vessels in the current environment  on industry standard terms  in cash transactions  and to a willing buyer where we are not under any compulsion to sell  and where the buyer is not under any compulsion to buy

we believe that the aggregate carrying value of these vessels exceeds their aggregate basic charter free market value by approximately million and  respectively 
we note that of our drybulk vessels are currently employed under mid term  above market time charters 
we believe that if the vessels were sold with those charters attached  we would receive a premium for those vessels over their basic market value 
deferred drydock cost there are two methods that are used by the shipping industry to account for drydockings a the deferral method where drydock costs are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period to the next scheduled drydock  and b expensing drydocking costs in the period it is incurred 
we use the deferral method of accounting for drydock expenses 
under the deferral method  drydock expenses are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis until the next drydock  which we estimate to be a period of two to three years 
we believe the deferral method better matches costs with revenue than expensing the costs as incurred 
we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks performed  which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock expense 
if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock  the remaining balance in deferral drydock is written off to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessels in the period when contracted 
we expect that our vessels will be required to be drydocked approximately every months 
costs capitalized as part of the drydocking include direct costs that are incurred as part of the drydocking to meet regulatory requirements  or are expenditures that add economic life to the vessel  increase the vessel s earnings capacity or improve the vessel s efficiency 
direct costs include the shipyard costs  parts  inspection fees  steel  blasting and painting 
expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs  whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not  are expensed as incurred 
unamortized dry docking costs of vessels that are sold are written off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or loss in the year of the vessels sale 
vessel acquisitions where we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel  we record all identified tangible and intangible assets or liabilities at fair value 
fair value is determined by reference to market data and the amount of expected future cash flows 
we value any asset or liability arising from the market value of the time charters assumed when an acquired vessel is delivered to us 
where we have assumed an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are less than market charter rates  we record a liability in fair value below contract value of time charters acquired based on the difference between the assumed charter rate and the market charter rate for an equivalent vessel 
conversely  where we assume an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are above market charter rates  we record an asset in fair value above contract value of time charters acquired  based on the difference between the market charter rate and the contracted charter rate for an equivalent vessel 
this determination is made at the time the vessel is delivered to us  and such assets and liabilities are amortized to revenue over the remaining period of the charter 
the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates of many variables including market charter rates  expected future charter rates  future vessel operation expenses  the level of utilization of our vessels and our weighted average cost of capital 
the use of different assumptions could result in a material change in the fair value of these items  which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in the event that the market charter rates relating to the acquired vessels are lower than the contracted charter rates at the time of their respective deliveries to us  our net earnings for the remainder of the terms of the charters may be adversely affected although our cash flows will not be so affected 
insurance claims insurance claims are recorded on an accrual basis and represent the claimable expenses  net of deductibles  incurred through each balance sheet date  which are expected to be recovered from insurance companies 
any remaining costs to complete the claims are included in accrued liabilities 
deferred financing costs fees incurred for obtaining new loans or refinancing existing loans are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt 
unamortized deferred financing costs are written off when the related debt is repaid  or there is a reduction in the facility  and such amounts are expensed in the period the repayment or refinancing is made 
results of operations for the years ended december   and factors affecting our results of operations we believe that the important measures for analyzing future trends in our results of operations consist of the following ownership days    chartered in under operating lease days  total    available days    operating days    fleet utilization ownership days we define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us 
ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period 
ownership days in increased due to the delivery of eight newbuilding vessels  reduced by the sale of one vessel in july chartered in under operating lease days the company defines chartered in under operating lease days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which the company chartered in vessels 
the company started to charter in vessels on a spot basis during the fourth quarter of available days we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to vessel familiarization upon acquisition  scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades or special surveys and drydockings  and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels 
the shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues 
we drydocked five vessels in  four vessels in and three vessels in operating days we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to any reason  including unforeseen circumstances 
the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues 
fleet utilization we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period 
the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades  special surveys or vessel positioning 
our fleet continues to perform at very high utilization rates 
time charter and voyage revenue shipping revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply of and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by a company and the trades in which those vessels operate 
in the dry bulk sector of the shipping industry  rates for the transportation of dry bulk cargoes such as ores  grains  steel  fertilizers  and similar commodities  are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for such commodities  the distance that cargoes must be transported  and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported 
the demand for shipments is significantly affected by the state of the economy globally and in discrete geographical areas 
the number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service  principally because of scrapping 
revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot or voyage charters and mid term time charters 
because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters  vessel revenues are bench marked on the basis of time charter equivalent tce revenues 
tce revenue comprises revenue from vessels operating on time charters  and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating on voyage charters in the spot market 
tce revenue serves as a measure of analyzing fluctuations between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue 
tce revenue also serves as an industry standard for measuring revenue and comparing results between geographical regions and among competitors 
our economic decisions are based on anticipated tce rates and we evaluate financial performance based on tce rates achieved 
our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet  the number of days during which our vessels operate and the amount of the daily tce that our vessels earn under charters  which  in turn  are affected by a number of factors  including the duration of our charters  our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals  the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels  the amount of time that our vessels spend in dry dock undergoing repairs  maintenance and upgrade work  the age  condition and specifications of our vessels  levels of supply and demand in the dry bulk shipping industry  and other factors affecting spot market charter rates for dry bulk carriers 
our revenues for the year ended december   and were earned from time charters and voyage charters 
as is common in the shipping industry  we pay commissions ranging from to of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter to unaffiliated ship brokers and in house brokers associated with the charterers  depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the charter 
net revenues for the year ended december  were  which is comprised of billed time charter revenues and voyage revenues of  amortization of fair value below contract value of time charters acquired of  and deductions for brokerage commissions of  net revenues for the year ended december  were lower than net revenues for the year ended december   primarily due to the lower charter rates earned by the fleet and a reduction of time chartered in vessels as reflected by the decreased operating days  offset by operation of a larger owned fleet 
net revenues for the year ended december  were  which is comprised of billed time charter revenues and voyage revenues of  amortization of fair value below contract value of time charters acquired of  and deductions for brokerage commissions of  net revenues for the year ended december  were greater than net revenues for the year ended december   primarily due to the operation of a larger fleet as reflected by the increased operating days  offset by lower charter rates earned by the fleet 
net revenues for the year ended december  of  which is comprised of billed time charter revenues of  amortization of fair value below contract value of time charters acquired of  and deductions for brokerage commissions of voyage expenses to the extent that we employ our vessels on voyage charters  we will incur expenses that include bunkers  port charges  canal tolls  cargo handling operations and brokerage commissions  as these expenses are borne by the vessel owner on voyage charters 
bunkers  port charges  and canal toll expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessels 
voyage expenses for the year ended december  were  compared with  for the year end december  the decrease in voyage expenses is attributable to reduction in voyage charter revenues and related port charges 
voyage expenses for the year ended december  were  compared with  in the comparable period in the increase in voyage expenses is attributable to increase in voyage charter revenues and related port charges as voyages were undertaken during the latter half of only 
vessel expenses vessel expenses for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
vessel expenses in included  in vessel operating costs and  in technical management fees 
vessel expenses in included  in vessel operating costs and  in technical management fees 
vessel expenses in included  in vessel operating costs and  in technical management fees 
vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs  the cost of insurance  expenses relating to repairs and maintenance  the cost of spares and consumable stores  tonnage taxes  other miscellaneous expenses  and technical management fees 
insurance expense varies with overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured loss record  level of insurance and desired coverage 
the main insurance expenses include hull and machinery insurance ie asset insurance costs and protection and indemnity p i insurance ie liability insurance costs 
certain other insurances  such as basic war risk premiums based on voyages into designated war risk areas are often for the account of the charterers 
with regard to vessel operating expenses  we have entered into technical management agreements for some of our vessels with our independent technical managers  v 
ships and anglo eastern international ltd 
in conjunction with our management  our managers have established an operating expense budget for each vessel 
all deviations from the budgeted amounts are for our account 
included in vessel expenses is a daily fixed management fee for each vessel in our operating fleet paid to our independent technical managers 
in  we set up our own in house technical management department for a portion of our fleet in order to establish a vessel management bench mark with our external technical managers 
for the years ended december    and  the technical management fees averaged   and  per month per vessel  respectively 
technical management services include managing day to day vessel operations  performing general vessel maintenance  ensuring regulatory and classification society compliance  supervising the maintenance and general efficiency of vessels  arranging the hire of qualified officers and crew  arranging dry docking and repairs  purchasing stores  supplies  spare parts and new equipment  appointing supervisors and technical consultants and providing technical support 
our vessel expenses  which generally represent costs under the vessel operating budgets  cost of insurance and vessel registry and other regulatory fees  will increase with the enlargement of our fleet 
other factors beyond our control  some of which may affect the shipping industry in general  may also cause these expenses to increase  including  for instance  developments relating to market prices for crew  insurance and petroleum based lubricants and supplies 
depreciation and amortization for the years ended december   and  total depreciation and amortization expense was   and  respectively 
total depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  includes  of depreciation and  of amortization of deferred drydocking costs 
total depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  includes  of depreciation and  of amortization of deferred drydocking costs 
total depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  includes  of depreciation and  of amortization of deferred drydocking costs 
the cost of our vessels is depreciated on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel 
depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value 
we estimate the useful life of our vessels to be years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner 
furthermore  we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be per lightweight ton 
our depreciation charges will increase as our fleet expands 
drydocking relates to our regularly scheduled maintenance program necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations 
management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years and  accordingly  these expenses are deferred and amortized over that period 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include onshore vessel administration related expenses such as legal and professional expenses and recurring administrative and other expenses including payroll and expenses relating to our executive officers and office staff  office rent and expenses  directors fees  and directors and officers insurance 
general and administrative expenses also include non cash compensation expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the general and administrative expenses decrease in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to lower compensation expense and professional consultants fees offset by an increase in amount of management fees received 
the general and administrative expenses decrease in  as compared to  was due primarily attributable to lower compensation expense and amortization of restricted stock awards  offset by an increase in number of office staff  an increase in consultant fees  and an allowance for bad debt of  and write offs of  related to amounts receivable from klc  which filed for protective receivership and received south korean court approval for rehabilitation during general and administrative expenses include non cash compensation charges of   and  respectively in   and these non cash compensation charges relate to the stock options and restricted stock units granted to members of management and certain directors of the company under the stock incentive plans see note

interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our debt from a floating to a fixed rate basis 
under these swap contracts  exclusive of applicable margins  we pay fixed rate interest and receive floating rate interest amounts based on three month libor settings 
the swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges

loss on sale of vessel in  the company sold the heron  a built supramax  and realized a net loss of  ebitda ebitda represents operating earnings before extraordinary items  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  and income taxes  if any 
ebitda is included because it is used by certain investors to measure a company financial performance 
ebitda is not an item recognized by us gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income  cash flow from operating activities and other operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
ebitda is presented to provide additional information with respect to the company s ability to satisfy its obligations including debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operating results and the ability to meet debt service requirements  the definition of ebitda used herein may not be comparable to that used by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation 
our term loan agreement require us to comply with financial covenants based on debt and interest ratio with extraordinary or exceptional items  interest  taxes  non cash compensation  depreciation and amortization credit agreement ebitda

as of december   our cash balance was  compared to a cash balance of  at december  in addition  our restricted cash balance includes  for collateralizing letters of credit relating to our office leases as of december  as of december   our restricted cash balance included  for collateralizing letters of credit relating to our office leases and  which collateralized our derivatives positions 
at december   the company debt consisted of  in term loans and  paid in kind loans 
on june   the company entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement to its credit facility agreement  dated as of october   as amended up to the date thereof the fourth amended and restated credit agreement  which  among other things  i permanently waives any purported defaults or events of defaults that were the subject of a temporary waiver under the sixth amendatory and commercial framework implementation agreement the sixth amendment to the third amended and restated credit agreement dated october   including any alleged events of default arising from any purported breach of the minimum adjusted net worth covenant that occurred as a result of any failure to maintain the required adjusted net worth  ii converts the  outstanding under the revolving credit facility into a term loan  iii sets the maturity date as december   and  subject to the company satisfaction of certain conditions  including a collateral coverage ratio at december  of less than  provides an option to the company to further extend the maturity date by an additional months to june  the termination date  iv requires no mandatory repayments of principal until the termination date  other than a quarterly sweep of cash on hand in excess of  and upon the sale of vessels  additional financings or future equity raises by the company 
all amounts outstanding under the term loan will bear interest at libor plus a margin that will include a payment in kind pik component 
the initial cash margin of and pik margin of can be reduced on the basis of reduced leverage and proceeds from future equity raises by the company 
the fourth amended and restated credit agreement also provides for a new liquidity facility in the aggregate amount of  which permits the purchase or sale of vessels within certain parameters  permits the management of third party vessels and provides that all capitalized interest will be evidenced in the form of pik loans  which will mature on the termination date 
on the termination date  the company may elect to either i repay the pik loans in cash  or ii convert the pik loans into shares of cumulative convertible preferred stock  par value per share 
as of december  the outstanding amount of the term loan was  the amount of the pik loans was  and no amount was drawn on the liquidity facility 
in connection with the fourth amended and restated credit amendment  the company recorded  of deferred financing costs that are amortized over the life of the term loan  including amendment and professional fees 
in addition  the fourth amended and restated credit agreement replaces the previously existing financial covenants and substitutes them with new covenants  which shall require the company to i maintain a maximum leverage ratio of the term loan indebtedness  excluding the pik loans  to ebitda as defined in the fourth amended and restated credit agreement on a trailing four quarter basis  commencing in the quarterly period ending september   of  december   of  march  of  june  of  september  of  december  of  march  of  june  of  september  of  and december  of and  should the termination date be extended under the company s option  further declining in intervals to for the quarterly period ending march   ii maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of ebitda to cash interest expenses on a trailing four quarter basis  expressed as a percentage  commencing in the quarterly period ending june   of  september   of  december   of  march  of  june  of  september  of  december  of  march  of  june  of  september  of  and december  of and  should the termination date be extended  further escalating in intervals to for the quarterly period ending march   iii maintain free cash with the agent in one or more accounts in an amount equal to  per vessel owned directly or indirectly by the company  provided that the unutilized amount of the liquidity facility shall be deemed to constitute free cash for these purposes  and iv maintain a maximum collateral coverage ratio  commencing in the quarterly period ending september   of of the term loan indebtedness and any related swap exposure  declining in intervals to for the quarterly period ending december  and  should the termination date be extended  further declining in intervals to for the quarterly period ending march  as further described in note  the fourth amended and restated credit facility has financial covenants that begin in and get increasingly tighter with each progressive quarter 
the covenants are primarily driven off of a trailing twelve month calculation of ebitda 
in order to remain in compliance with our covenants  charter hire rates  the primary driver of our ebitda  must increase over time 
charter hire rates have been driven down during the recession and have been volatile 
despite relatively low charter hire rates in the last part of and first weeks of  the company estimates that it will meet all of its covenants in  based on the current dry bulk rates that have been in effect for the last month of the first quarter of and cost cutting measures that the company has put in place 
such cost cutting measures include but are not limited to reductions in labor costs  upgrades and new equipment expenses 
however  if the current charter hire rate does not improve for the remainder of and in the first quarter of  the company will not be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage ratio covenants under our credit agreement at or after march   and  if charter rates deteriorate significantly from current levels or if we are unable to achieve our cost cutting measures  the company may not be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio or the minimum interest coverage ratio covenants in if the company does not comply with these covenants  which would constitute a default under our credit agreement  the company would seek to obtain a waiver or modification to the credit agreement from our creditors  however there is no guarantee that we would receive such a waiver or that such a waiver would be on terms or conditions that would be acceptable to the company 
if we were to be unable to cure an event of default our debt could be called by the banks and all amounts then outstanding would be reclassified as a current liability and alternative sources of financing would need to be sought on terms that may not be favorable to the company or the company may need to seek additional capital through equity or debt offerings or through the sale of assets 
should such events happen  there can be no assurances that the company would be able to procure alternate financing or sufficient sources of additional capital 
the company s credit agreement is described further in note in connection with the fourth amended and restated credit agreement  the company entered into a warrant agreement  dated june   pursuant to which the company issued  warrants convertible on a cashless basis into shares of the company common stock  par value the warrant shares  at a strike price of per share of common stock 
one third of the warrants are exercisable immediately  the next third of the warrants are exercisable when the price of the company common stock reaches per share and the last third of the warrants are exercisable when the price of the company common stock reaches per share 
unexercised warrants will expire on june  the company determined the relative fair value of the warrant shares at million using the monte carlo simulation which was performed  and the mean value was selected 
the assumptions used in the monte carlo simulation were the underlying stock price of  risk free rate of  expected volatility of  expected term of years and expected dividend yield of 
the fair value of the warrants was recorded as deferred financing cost and amortized over of the life the term loan agreement 
our obligations under the fourth amended and restated credit agreement are secured by a first priority mortgage on each of the vessels in our fleet  and by a first assignment of all freights  earnings  insurances and requisition compensation relating to our vessels 
the fourth amended and restated credit agreement also limits our ability to create liens on our assets in favor of other parties 
we anticipate that our current financial resources  together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund the operations of our fleet  including our working capital  throughout the general decline in the dry bulk carrier charter market has resulted in lower charter rates for vessels in the dry bulk market 
as mentioned above  if the current charter hire rate does not improve for the remainder of and in the first quarter of  the company will not be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio and the minimum interest coverage ratio covenants under our credit agreement at or after march   and  if charter rates deteriorate significantly from current levels or if we are unable to achieve our cost cutting measures  the company may not be in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio or the minimum interest coverage ratio covenants in 
although there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so  we are evaluating asset sales  equity and debt financing alternatives that could raise incremental cash 
in august  the company filed a new shelf registration statement  which became effective on october   to replace its previous shelf registration statement that expired in august under the new shelf registration statement  the company may issue up to an aggregate of  of securities  including common shares  preferred shares  debt securities which may be guaranteed by certain of the company s subsidiaries  warrants  purchase contracts  rights and units comprised of any of the aforementioned securities 
in addition  in connection with the fourth amended and restated credit agreement discussed above  the company entered into a registration rights agreement the registration rights agreement  dated june   with its lenders pursuant to which the company agreed to register the warrant shares for resale under the securities act 
under the terms of the registration rights agreement  the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s on june  relating to the warrant shares  which became effective on september  pursuant to the registration rights agreement  the company has agreed to keep the registration statement effective and file all information required to be filed under rule or the exchange act until the warrant shares are otherwise freely tradable without restriction under rule under the securities act 
dividends the company did not make any dividend payments in  and in the future  the declaration and payment of dividends  if any  will always be subject to the discretion of the board of directors  restrictions contained in the amended credit facility and the requirements of marshall islands law 
the timing and amount of any dividends declared will depend on  among other things  the company earnings  financial condition and cash requirements and availability  the ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as contemplated by the company growth strategy  the terms of its outstanding indebtedness and the ability of the company subsidiaries to distribute funds to it 
credit agreement refer to note debt of our consolidated financial statements and to liquidity and capital resources section above for a summary of our credit agreement 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our expected contractual obligations and their maturity dates as of december  in thousands of us dollars within one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total bank loans   pik loans   interest and borrowing fees   chartering agreement     office lease    total     the company is a party to floating to fixed interest rate swaps covering aggregate notional amount of  does not include obligations of charter in vessels less than one year 
on july   the company entered into an agreement to charter in a  dwt newbuilding japanese vessel that is expected to be delivered between may and october for seven years with an option for additional one year 
the hire rate for the st to th year is  per day and for the th year option  per day 
remainder of the lease on the office space which we occupy 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures relate to the purchase of vessels and capital improvements to our vessels which are expected to enhance the revenue earning capabilities and safety of these vessels 
in addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods  the company other major capital expenditures include funding the company program of regularly scheduled drydocking necessary to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations 
although the company has some flexibility regarding the timing of its dry docking  the costs are relatively predictable 
management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years 
funding of these requirements is anticipated to be met with cash from operations 
we anticipate that this process of recertification will require us to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities  which will reduce our available days and operating days during that period 
drydocking costs incurred are deferred and amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the period through the date of the next scheduled drydocking for those vessels 
in three of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred  in drydocking related costs 
in  four of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred  in drydocking related costs 
in  five of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred  in drydocking related costs 
the following table represents certain information about the estimated costs for anticipated vessel drydockings in the next four quarters  along with the anticipated off hire days quarter ending off hire days projected costs march  million june  million september  million december  million actual duration of drydocking will vary based on the condition of the vessel  yard schedules and other factors 
actual costs will vary based on various factors  including where the drydockings are actually performed 
contracted time charter revenue we have time charter contracts currently for all our vessels in the operating fleet
