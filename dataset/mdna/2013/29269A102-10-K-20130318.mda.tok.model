item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report 
please note that the company effected a for reverse stock split on january   and all historical common stock and per share information has been changed to reflect the stock split 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases 
we use our proprietary technology to create novel small molecule drug conjugates  or smdcs  and companion imaging diagnostics 
our smdcs actively target receptors that are over expressed on diseased cells  relative to healthy cells 
this targeted approach is designed to enable the treatment of patients with highly active drugs at greater doses  delivered more frequently  and over longer periods of time than would be possible with the untargeted drug alone 
we are also developing companion imaging diagnostics for each of our smdcs that are designed to identify the patients whose disease over expresses the target of the therapy and who are therefore more likely to benefit from treatment 
this combination of an smdc with its companion imaging diagnostic is designed to personalize the treatment of patients by delivering effective therapy  selectively to diseased cells  in the patients most likely to benefit 
our lead smdc candidate  vintafolide  targets the folate receptor  which is frequently over expressed on cancer cells 
we have chosen platinum resistant ovarian cancer  or proc  a highly treatment resistant disease  as our lead indication for development of vintafolide because of the high unmet need in treating this patient population and the high percentage of ovarian cancer patients whose tumors over express the targeted folate receptor 
we conducted a multicenter  open label randomized phase clinical trial of vintafolide in women with proc  referred to as the precedent trial 
based upon our findings from the precedent trial  we initiated enrollment of our proceed trial  a phase registration trial in women with proc  in the first half of proceed is a randomized  double blinded trial of vintafolide in combination with pld compared to pld plus placebo 
the patient population  those with proc  will be the same as in the precedent trial  and the primary endpoint with be pfs in fr patients 
the secondary endpoint will be overall survival  or os  in this same population 
we temporarily suspended enrollment in late due to the global shortage of pld 
janssen products  lp has announced full access to doxil in the u 
s and we have resumed enrollment in the us the new supply process in europe has been approved by the committee for medicinal products for human use  or chmp  and we have begun enrolling patients in europe and are activating additional sites in the eu as caelyx supply is sufficient to support it 
in  we will be increasing the amount of time and resources  both financial and personnel  devoted to our vintafolide program in proc 
we expect pfs data from proceed in the first half of we are also developing vintafolide for use in non small cell lung cancer or nsclc 
based on results of our single arm  single agent phase clinical trial of vintafolide in patients with second line nsclc  in we began enrollment in target  a randomized phase b trial 
the trial is designed to enroll up to patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung who have failed one prior line of therapy 
patients will be selected based on etarfolatide scan results and only fr patients will be included 
the trial design is intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vintafolide in second line nsclc as a single agent and in combination with docetaxel  a commonly used second line chemotherapy approved by the us food and drug administration  or the fda 
the study will have three arms docetaxel alone  vintafolide alone  and vintafolide plus docetaxel 
the primary outcome measure will be pfs with secondary measures of os  tumor response and duration of response 
we expect pfs data to be available in the first half of in april  we entered into a worldwide collaboration agreement with merck sharp dohme research gmbh  a subsidiary of merck co  inc  or merck  regarding the development and commercialization of vintafolide 
the agreement grants merck worldwide rights to develop and commercialize vintafolide 
we received a non refundable million upfront payment and a million milestone payment in and are eligible for additional milestone payments of up to million based on the 
table of contents successful achievement of development  regulatory and commercialization goals for vintafolide in a total of six different cancer indications 
following regulatory approval and launch of vintafolide  we will split us earnings under the collaboration arrangement on a basis with merck and will receive a double digit percentage royalty on sales of the product in the rest of the world 
we have retained the right which we can opt out of to co promote vintafolide with merck in the us and merck has the exclusive right to promote vintafolide in the rest of the world 
we are responsible for the majority of funding and completion of the ongoing proceed trial 
merck will pay a portion of proceed trial costs and will pay percent of the incremental costs of enrolling the additional fr patients in the event the dsmb makes that election 
we will be responsible for the execution of the target trial of vintafolide for the treatment of second line non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
merck will be responsible for the costs of the target trial and for all other development activities and costs and will have all decision rights with respect to the development and commercialization of vintafolide 
we will remain responsible for the development  manufacture and commercialization worldwide of etarfolatide 
merck has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement on days notice 
each party has the right to terminate the agreement due to the material breach or insolvency of the other party 
we have the right to terminate the agreement in the event that merck challenges an endocyte patent right relating to vintafolide 
upon termination of the agreement  depending upon the circumstances  the parties have varying rights and obligations with respect to the continued development and commercialization of vintafolide and  in the case of termination for cause by merck  certain royalty obligations and us profit and loss sharing 
in addition to proc  merck will be pursuing clinical trials of vintafolide in other indications and we also plan to advance other smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics through development as preclinical and clinical trial results merit and funding permits 
in november  the european medicines agency  or the ema  accepted our applications for conditional marketing authorization for vintafolide for the treatment of proc and etarfolatide and folic acid for patient selection 
these applications are supported by four clinical studies a phase study in solid tumors  two single agent  single arm phase studies in ovarian cancer and nsclc and the results and supplemental analyses of the precedent trial 
we expect to receive a decision from the ema on our applications in the fourth quarter of the results of the precedent trial demonstrated a statistically significant delay in disease progression or death in the overall population  with the largest improvement observed in the fr patient population  those with all tumors positive for the folate receptor 
women with fr proc who received vintafolide based therapy experienced a percent decrease in their risk of progression 
hr  p 
compared to women receiving chemotherapy alone 
median progression free survival pfs  the time without disease progressing in the vintafolide based treatment arm was months compared to months of women who received chemotherapy alone 
tumor shrinkage overall response rate was observed in percent of women receiving the vintafolide based therapy compared to percent in patients treated with chemotherapy alone 
financial operations overview we have never been profitable and have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had a retained deficit of million 
we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating expenses for the next several years as we pursue the advancement of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics through the research  development  regulatory and commercialization processes 
we expect that our current cash position of million at december   which includes cash equivalents and investments  is sufficient to fund our current operating plan  including completion of the proceed trial through the availability of pfs data from that study which is anticipated to be in the first half of  including a potential additional patients which we expect could take an additional nine to ten months to enroll  and the advancement of our earlier stage pipeline 
if we were to receive conditional marketing approval in europe of vintafolide and etarfolatide prior to the completion of the proceed study  this could impact the enrollment timeline as patients to be enrolled in european sites would transition from clinical trials to commercial use 
this could delay the availability of final data from the proceed trial 
we may be able to mitigate this potential delay by adding clinical trial sites in locations where conditional marketing approval has not been granted 
if we initiate significant investments in our earlier stage pipeline and 
table of contents commercial capabilities  we may require additional financing through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources  such as other strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements  to fund the additional activities 
such funding may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies 
revenue to date  we have generated no revenue from sales of our smdcs or companion imaging diagnostics 
all of our revenue has been derived from license fees  milestone payments and government grants 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a combination of direct sales of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  license fees  milestone payments and royalties in connection with strategic collaborations  such as our collaboration with merck 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  achievement of performance based milestones and other payments received under such collaborations  and the amount and timing of payments that we receive upon the sale of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
based upon our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics currently in development and the stage of development  we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until the fourth quarter of at the earliest 
if we or our strategic partners fail to complete the development of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics in a timely manner or fail to obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our results of operations and financial position  would be materially adversely affected 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  including employee related expenses  which include salaries and stock based compensation expense  expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a portion of our preclinical studies  the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials  license fees for and milestone payments related to in licensed products and technology  costs associated with non clinical activities and regulatory approvals  and research supplies 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
license fees and milestone payments related to in licensed products and technology and research supplies are expensed if it is determined that they have no alternative future use 
conducting a significant amount of research and development is central to our business model 
our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of development  primarily due to the increased size and duration of late stage clinical trials 
we plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future due to the proceed and target trials for vintafolide and to further advance our earlier stage research and development projects 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across multiple projects 
through our clinical development programs  we are advancing our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics in parallel for multiple therapeutic indications and through our preclinical development programs we are seeking to develop potential smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics for additional disease indications 
the following table sets forth costs incurred on a program specific basis for identified lead candidate smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  excluding personnel related costs 
discovery research includes such costs for projects where no lead candidate has yet been identified 
all employee related expenses for those employees working in research and development functions are included in research and development payroll

other general and administrative expenses include employee benefits  facility  patent filing and prosecution costs  and professional service fees 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future primarily for the following reasons increased payroll and expanded infrastructure as a result of more advanced development activity and preparation for commercial operations  and expenses related to the sales and marketing of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics in anticipation of commercial launch before we receive regulatory approval

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical 
table of contents experience  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in preparation of our financial statements and have been reviewed and discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from license and collaboration agreements when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and there is reasonable assurance that the related amounts are collectible in accordance with the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition 
our license and collaboration agreements may contain multiple elements  including grants of licenses to intellectual property rights and agreement to provide research and development services 
the deliverables under arrangements are evaluated under asc subtopic  multiple element arrangements 
effective january   we adopted an accounting standard update that amends the guidance on accounting for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
pursuant to the new standard  each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting based on whether the deliverable has stand alone value to the customer 
the arrangement s consideration that is fixed or determinable is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
in general  the consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as the related goods or services are delivered  limited to the consideration that is not contingent upon future deliverables 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
this evaluation requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the selling price of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
upfront payments for licensing our intellectual property are evaluated to determine if the licensee can obtain stand alone value from the license separate from the value of the research and development services and other deliverables in the arrangement to be provided by us 
if we determine that the license does not have stand alone value separate from the research and development services  the license and the services are combined as one unit of account and upfront payments are recorded as deferred revenue in the balance sheet and are recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period that is consistent with the term of the research and development obligations contained in the collaboration agreement 
when stand alone value is identified  the related consideration is recorded as revenue in the period in which the license or other intellectual property rights are delivered 
in those circumstances where research and development services are combined with the license  and multiple services are being performed such that a common output measure to determine a pattern of performance cannot be discerned  we recognize amounts received on a straight line basis over the performance period 
such amounts are recorded as collaboration revenue 
subsequent reimbursement payments  which are contingent upon our future research and development expenditures  will be recorded as collaboration revenue and will be recognized on a straight line basis over the performance period using the cumulative catch up method 
the costs associated with these activities are reflected as a component of research and development expense in the statements of operations in the period incurred 
milestone payments under collaborative arrangements are triggered either by the results of our research and development efforts or by specified sales results by a third party collaborator 
milestones related to our development based activities may include initiation of various phases of clinical trials  successful completion of a phase of development or results from a clinical trial  and applications and acceptance for product approvals by regulatory agencies 
due to the uncertainty involved in meeting these development based milestones  the determination is made at the inception of the collaboration agreement whether the development based milestones are considered to be substantial ie not just achieved through passage of time 
in addition  the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are considered to be commensurate with the 
table of contents enhancement of the value of the delivered intellectual property as a result of our performance 
our involvement is necessary to the achievement of development based milestones 
we would account for development based milestones as revenue upon achievement of the substantive milestone events 
milestones related to sales based activities may be triggered upon events such as the first commercial sale of a product or when sales first achieve a defined level 
under our collaboration agreement with merck  merck will take the lead in commercialization activities for vintafolide in certain territories and we have retained the right which we can opt out of to co promote vintafolide in the us with merck 
these sales based milestones would be achieved after the completion of our development activities 
we would account for the sales based milestones in the same manner as royalties  with revenue recognized upon achievement of the milestone 
we often are required to make estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines for compounds being developed pursuant to a collaboration agreement 
because the drug development process is lengthy and our collaboration agreements typically cover activities over several years  this approach often results in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue into future periods 
in addition  because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates  our estimates regarding the period of performance may change in the future 
any change in our estimates could result in substantial changes to the period over which the revenues are recognized 
accrued clinical expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts  identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we estimate our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
expense accruals related to clinical trial activity typically comprise the majority of these accruals 
examples of estimated expenses related to clinical trial activity include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  and fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under certain contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services are performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of the effort varies from our estimate  we adjust the accrual accordingly 
although our estimates in the past have not been materially different from amounts actually incurred  and we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred in the future  if our estimate of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period 
based on our level of clinical trial expenses for the twelve months ended december   a five percent change in our estimate could result in an adjustment to our accrued clinical trial expense in future periods of approximately  stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the recognition provisions of fasb asc topic compensation stock compensation  which we refer to as asc  using the prospective transition method 
options granted under the and stock plans for performance or promotions vest monthly over a four year period 
generally  options granted under the company s equity incentive plan  or the plan  vest annually over a four year period 
unexercised stock options terminate on the tenth anniversary date after the date of grant 
the company recognizes the stock based compensation expense over the requisite 
table of contents service period of the individual grantees  which generally equals the vesting period 
in connection with the adoption of asc  the company reassessed the valuation methodology for stock options and the related input assumptions 
as a result  beginning with stock option grants  the company utilizes a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options 
the black scholes model allows the use of a range of assumptions related to volatility  risk free interest rate  and employee exercise behavior 
prior to the initial public offering  the expected volatility was derived from the historical volatility of the nasdaq biotechnology index  which the company determined was a proxy for its volatility 
since the company elected to use an index to determine the value of its stock options  it has applied the calculated value approach for a private company instead of using fair value 
since august  all grants have been valued under the fair value provisions of asc since the company completed its initial public offering in february  it does not have sufficient history as a publicly traded company to evaluate volatility 
as a result  the company has used an average of several peer companies volatilities to determine a reasonable estimate of volatility 
for purposes of identifying similar entities  the company considered characteristics such as industry  length of trading history  market capitalization and similar product pipelines 
the risk free interest rate assumption is derived from the weighted average yield of a us treasury security with the same term as the expected life of the options  and the dividend yield assumption is based on historical experience and the company s estimate of future dividend yields 
prior to february  the expected life of the options was based on the weighted average life of the company s historical option grants 
subsequent to the february initial public offering  due to the lack of available quarterly data for the peer companies and insufficient history as a public company  the company elected to use the simplified method for plain vanilla options to estimate the expected term of stock option grants 
under this approach  the weighted average expected life is presumed to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
the value of our stock options was estimated at the grant date using the following assumptions

as of december   we had million in total unrecognized compensation expense  net of related forfeiture estimates  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately years 
in may  the company adopted and granted awards under a new performance based restricted stock unit  or rsu  program the rsu program under the plan 
each unit represents an amount equal to one share of the company s common stock 
the rsus will be earned  in whole or in part  based on performance and service conditions 
the performance condition is based upon whether the company receives regulatory approval to sell a therapeutic product  and the awards include a target number of rsus that will vest upon a first commercial approval  and a maximum number of rsus that will vest upon a second commercial approval 
the rsus will vest fifty percent based on the performance condition of commercial approval and fifty percent one year thereafter to fulfill the service condition  which requires the employee to remain employed by the company 
as of december   the company has  rsu awards outstanding 
the unrecorded stock compensation expense is based on number of units granted  less estimated forfeitures based on the company s historical forfeiture rate of  and the closing market price of the company s common stock at the grant date 
as of december   the performance condition of obtaining regulatory approval had not been achieved  therefore  no vesting had occurred 
the awards are being accounted for under asc  and compensation expense will be recorded when the company determines that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved 
as of december   it was not probable that the performance conditions 
table of contents will be achieved  therefore  no compensation expense related to the rsus was recorded for the year ended december  unrecorded compensation expense for the rsu program as of december  was million

on target is solely responsible for conducting research and development  seeking regulatory approval and commercialization of products 
the company received nonrefundable upfront license fees totaling  from on target in december and annual license fees of  in the fourth quarter of the amounts were recognized as collaboration revenue in the respective period 
on target is considered a related party as that company s chief executive officer is the brother of the company s chief science officer 
the company believes that the terms of the agreement are no less favorable than terms available in an arm s length transaction 
other than the  license fee received from on target  the remaining revenue of approximately million recorded in the year ended related to the collaboration with merck 
this revenue was related to an amortization of the million upfront license payment  a million milestone payment earned in the fourth quarter of  million in reimbursable development expenditures incurred in periods prior to and million of reimbursable development expenditures incurred in the year ended december  the amortization for both the upfront license fee and ongoing research and development services will be recognized as revenue ratably over the performance period 
research and development the increase in research and development expense in compared to was attributable to a million increase in product development expenses and a million increase in compensation expenses 
the increase in product development expenses was due to a million increase in expenses principally due to the proceed and target trials and a million increase in development costs for the earlier stage pipeline 
the increase in compensation expenses included a million increase in stock based compensation expense  increased salary expense and an increase in bonus accrual  partially offset by a million decrease due to severance compensation and related stock based compensation expense recorded in the year ended december  included in research and development expense for the year ended december  were million of expenses that were reimbursable from merck under the collaboration agreement

the increase in cash used in compared to was due to increases in clinical trial expenses  manufacturing and regulatory expenses related to the anticipated regulatory filing with the ema for vintafolide and etarfolatide and general and administrative expenses relating to being a public company 
the cash provided by operating activities in resulted from deferred revenue related to the portion of the million received from merck that will be recognized ratably over the performance period 
investing activities the cash provided by used in investing activities for each of the three years was due primarily to the net result of maturities and sales of investments  which was slightly offset by capital expenditures for equipment of  in   in and  in financing activities the cash provided by financing activities in consisted of repaying our credit facility with gecc and oxford of million  receiving proceeds from our new credit facility with mid cap and svb of million and receiving gross proceeds of million for the issuance of subordinated notes 
the cash provided by financing activities in primarily consisted of the million in proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes and million in proceeds from the public offerings in february and august and  in payments from the exercise of stock options 
these receipts were partially offset by million of principal payments on the mid cap and svb loan facility 
in  the cash used in financing activities consisted of the million prepayment of our credit facility  which included a prepayment fee of million  which was slightly offset by million received from the exercise of stock options 
operating capital requirements if we obtain conditional marketing approval of vintafolide and etarfolatide in europe  we anticipate commercializing our first product in late at the earliest 
therefore  we anticipate we will continue to incur significant expenses for the next several years to complete the proceed trial  build commercial capabilities in the u 
s for vintafolide and etarfolatide and internationally for etarfolatide  develop our earlier stage pipeline  and expand our corporate infrastructure 
we believe that our current cash position of million at december   including cash equivalents and investments  is sufficient to fund our current operating plan  including the proceed trial  in which we are responsible for the majority of the funding  and the advancement of our earlier stage pipeline 
merck will be responsible for the costs of the target trial 

table of contents because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of our working capital requirements 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the number and characteristics of the smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics we pursue  the scope  progress  results and costs of researching and developing our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics and conducting preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals for our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  the cost of commercialization activities if any of our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics are approved for sale  including marketing  sales and distribution costs  the cost of manufacturing any smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics we successfully commercialize  the success of our collaboration with merck for vintafolide  including receiving milestone payments under the collaboration  and our ability to establish and maintain other strategic partnerships  licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation  and the timing  receipt and amount of sales of  or royalties on  our smdcs and companion imaging diagnostics  if any 
if our available cash  cash equivalents and investments are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional opportunities to pursue  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain new loans or credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or convertible preferred stock  these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we were unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december

total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations  capital lease obligations total contractual cash obligations  we repaid the outstanding balance of and terminated our credit facility in june and therefore did not have any debt obligations outstanding at december  in addition to the obligations shown in the above table  under the collaboration agreement that we entered into with merck in april  we will be responsible for the majority of funding and completion of the proceed trial  and we will remain responsible for the development  manufacture and commercialization worldwide of etarfolatide 
in addition  we have certain obligations under licensing agreements with third parties 
in october  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license with r d biopharmaceuticals to research  develop  and commercialize products containing conjugates of folate receptor targeting compounds and tubulysin compounds 
in february  this licensing agreement was assigned by r d biopharmaceuticals to 
table of contents trientlgasse 
under this license agreement  we may be required to make million in additional contingent payments upon the achievement of specific scientific  clinical and regulatory milestones  in addition to royalties upon commercial sales 
pursuant to our exclusive license agreement with purdue research foundation relating to folate  we are obligated to pay an annual minimum royalty of  until commercial sales commence  following which time the payment of royalties with market rates will commence 
pursuant to our exclusive license agreement with purdue research foundation relating to psma  we are obligated to pay annual minimum payments of  until commercial sales commence  following which time the payment of royalties with market rates will commence  along with an annual milestone payment of  in addition  certain clinical and regulatory milestone payments of  along with sales based milestones related to third party sales are also payable 
we are also subject to penalties totaling  if certain diligence milestones are not met 
future milestone payments in excess of  may be waived by purdue research foundation 
there are no material obligations greater than five years 
we do not anticipate incurring liabilities for vintafolide royalty payments based on the estimated timing of when we may have commercial sales and the expiration of the applicable patents 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have during the periods presented  and we do not currently have  any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under rules promulgated by the securities and exchange commission 
tax loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income taxes  respectively  that may be used to offset future taxable income 
we also have research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million to offset future federal income taxes and approximately million to offset future state income taxes 
we experienced an ownership change in august as a result  the future use of our net operating losses  after giving effect to net unrealized built in gains  will be limited to approximately  for   per year for the years through   for and  for any available but unused amounts will become available for use in all successive years 
at december   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  as we believe it is more likely than not that the net operating loss carryforwards will not be fully realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and december  we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million and million  respectively 
the investments consisted of us government money market funds  us treasuries  us government agency obligations  us corporate securities and cash equivalents 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because our investments are in short term marketable securities 
our short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
we have the ability to hold our short investments until maturity  and therefore we do not expect that our results of operations or cash flows would be adversely affected by any change in market interest rates on our investments 
we carry our investments based on publicly available information 
we do not currently have any investment securities for which a market is not readily available or active 
we do not believe that any credit risk is likely to have a material impact on the value of our assets and liabilities 
we contract with contract research organizations and investigational sites globally 
we may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements 
a ten percent fluctuation in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk  but as our operations in foreign countries expand  we may consider the use of hedges
