item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes beginning on page f in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors in this annual report on form k 
our company we were incorporated in delaware under the delaware general corporation law in march  and are the successor to apex silver for purposes of reporting under the us exchange act 
during the year ended december   our only sources of income were revenues from various products produced at the velarde a operations  royalty and interest income  and sales of non core exploration properties 
we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december    and we expect to report increased revenues from the velarde a operations during as a result of increased production rates and improved ore grades 
highlights during the year ended december  we focused our efforts primarily on production and operational improvements at our velarde a operations  advancing our el quevar project  continued rationalization of our exploration portfolio and raising additional capital through equity financing 
an overview of certain significant events is provided below velarde a operations production and operating improvements 
in the velarde a operations had payable metals production totaling approximately  ounces of silver and  ounces of gold for a total of approximately  silver equivalent ounces 
the average quarterly production of silver equivalent ounces at the velarde a operations in was about greater than the approximately  silver equivalent ounces for silver and gold reported for the second quarter  the final reporting period prior to the company acquisition of the velarde a operations in september additionally  during the company produced approximately million pounds of payable lead and million pounds of payable zinc 
production increased during the third quarter principally due to the employment of additional mining equipment  the arrival of the underground mining equipment  increased grades resulting from improved ore control procedures in the mine and some ore production from newly developed and non exploited stopes 
comparing silver and gold grades in mined material from the fourth quarter to the first quarter  we improved silver grades by approximately  and gold grades by approximately 
we experienced lower gold recoveries in the fourth quarter due to different metallurgy in some newly developed ore areas 
as such  gold production during the fourth quarter was negatively impacted 
we have completed about kilometers of the planned kilometers san mateo ramp  which has permitted us to access the terneras and san mateo vein systems at the velarde a mine 
when completed  anticipated in the third quarter  the san mateo ramp will provide improved access to the lower workings of the santa juana vein system  which has the largest number of vein units and slightly higher grade than the chicago and san juanes mining areas  where about of our mining was done in we also made significant processing improvements in the oxide and sulfide plants in  including installation of a new flotation circuit at the oxide plant  which we are now using ahead of the leach circuit to produce a high grade silver lead concentrate that is sold with the lead concentrates produced at the sulfide plant 
we also doubled the capacity of the merrill crowe circuit at the oxide plant 
we processed an average of approximately tonnes per day through the plants in and expect to process an average of from to tonnes per day in we are also testing other technologies  including an albion oxidation process to improve gold recoveries 
updated estimate of mineralized material 
during the second quarter  chlumsky  armburst and meyer cam completed an estimate of mineralized material at the velarde a operations 
according to the cam estimate  there are an estimated  tonnes of mineralized material at an average silver grade of approximately grams per tonne and an average gold grade of approximately grams per tonne 
for further detail regarding mineralized material  see cautionary statement regarding mineralized material above 
el quevar advancement 
in late and early  we commenced a  meter  hole drilling program at the quevar north and south areas at el quevar 
results may represent a significant extension of the previously defined yaxtch deposit and a mineralized zone at quevar north similar in structural control to the yaxtch zone 
updated estimate of mineralized material 
during the second quarter  rungepincockminarco formerly pincock allen holt completed an updated estimate of mineralized material at the el quevar project 
according to this estimate  there are an estimated  tonnes of mineralized material at an average silver grade of approximately grams per tonne 
for further detail regarding mineralized material  see cautionary statement regarding mineralized material above 
exploration portfolio rationalization we have made significant progress with our ongoing strategy to rationalize our portfolio of exploration properties  realizing in and the first quarter  exploration property sales totaling approximately million 
we also have relinquished properties no longer of interest  and have reduced our portfolio of about properties containing about  hectares to about properties containing about  hectares 
since  we have reduced ongoing annual expenditures for the exploration program by approximately percent 
financing activity in the third quarter  we completed an underwritten registered offering of  units and concurrent private placement to the sentient group sentient of  units  for total net proceeds of million 
each unit was comprised of one share of the company common stock and a five year warrant to purchase of a share of the company common stock at an exercise price of per share 
sentient  the company largest stockholder  continues to hold approximately of the company outstanding common stock 
results of operations for the results of operations discussed below  we compare the results of operations for the year ended december  to the results of operations for the years ended december   and december  revenue from the sale of metals 
we recorded million of revenue for the year ended december   all from the sale of products produced at our velarde a operations in mexico 
we had no operations prior to the acquisition of the velarde a operations during september  consequently we recorded million of revenue for the period ended september through december   and no revenue for the year ended december  management service fees 
effective june   we terminated the san crist bal management services agreement with sumitomo corporation 
consequently we recorded no management services fees for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded million of management service fees comprised of million of fees  a million early termination payment  and million for reimbursed withholding taxes 
costs of metals sold 
we recorded million of costs applicable to sales for the year ended december   all from the sale of products produced at our velarde a operations in mexico 
we had no operations prior to the acquisition of the velarde a operations during september  consequently we recorded million of costs applicable to sales for the period september through december   and no costs of metals sold were recorded for the year ended december  included in costs of metals sold were million and million of write downs of finished goods inventory to estimated net realizable value for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
costs of services 
as a result of the june  termination of the san crist bal management services agreement with sumitomo corporation  we recorded no costs of services for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  we recorded million of costs of services comprised of reimbursed direct administrative expenses incurred by us related to the management services agreement 
exploration expense 
our exploration expense  including property holding costs and allocated administrative expenses  totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
exploration expense for all three years was incurred primarily in mexico  peru  and argentina excluding amounts spent on the yaxtch deposit at the el quevar project and includes property holding costs and costs incurred by our local exploration offices 
the decrease in exploration expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the years ended december  and is the result of our reduced spending on exploration as we attempt to rationalize and monetize our exploration portfolio 
exploration expense during was higher than due to increased drilling activity at advanced stage exploration projects  primarily in mexico and peru 
velarde a project and development expense 
during the year ended december  we incurred million of expenses related to our velarde a operations in mexico  primarily related to development of the san mateo drift  other mine development  and engineering work 
in addition to amounts expensed during the year ended december   we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million for plant construction  mining and other equipment and had outstanding approximately million of advance payments to equipment manufacturers at december  during the year ended december   following the purchase of the velarde a operations during september  we incurred million of expenses related to the expansion project at our velarde a operations in mexico  primarily related to development of the san mateo drift and engineering work 
in addition to amounts expensed during  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million for mining and other equipment and had outstanding approximately million of advance payments to equipment manufacturers at december  the velarde a operations were acquired during september  consequently  there were no velarde a project expenses recorded for the year ended december  el quevar project expense 
during the year ended december  we incurred million of expenses primarily related to furthering our evaluation of the yaxtch deposit at our el quevar project in argentina 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of expenses related to project work at el quevar  primarily related to development of the exploration drift  drilling and engineering work 
we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million for mining and other equipment and had outstanding approximately million of advance payments to equipment manufacturers at december  during the year ended december   we incurred million of expenses related to project work at el quevar  primarily related to development of the exploration drift  drilling and engineering work and we also purchased approximately million of mining equipment and had outstanding approximately million of advance payments to equipment manufacturers at december  the decrease in el quevar project expense during is the result of a shift in emphasis to the development and operations of our velarde a operations in mexico 
for all three years  costs incurred for work performed outside of the yaxtch deposit are included in exploration expense discussed above 
administrative expense 
administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december  compared to and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
administrative expenses  including costs associated with being a public company  are incurred primarily by our corporate activities in support of the velarde a operations  el quevar project work  and our exploration portfolio 
the million of administrative expenses we incurred during is comprised of million of employee compensation and directors fees  million of professional fees  million of travel expenses and million of insurance  rents  utilities and other office costs 
the million of administrative expenses we incurred during is comprised of million of employee compensation  million of professional fees  million of travel expenses and million of insurance  rents  utilities and other office costs 
during we incurred million of administrative expenses  which were comprised of million of employee compensation  million of professional fees  million of travel expenses and million of insurance  rents  utilities and other office costs 
severance and acquisition related costs 
during the year ended december  we incurred million of costs associated with the acquisition of our velarde a operations  including banker  legal  accounting and other professional fees  as well as severance related costs for several executives of ecu 
we incurred no such costs during or stock based compensation 
during the year ended december  we incurred expense related to stock based compensation in the amount of million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
stock based compensation was higher in compared to the previous year and the current year due to the accelerated vesting of stock grants at the completion of the acquisition of the velarde a operations  which resulted in a change of control of golden minerals 
stock based compensation varies from period to period depending on the number and timing of shares granted  the type of grant  the market value of the shares on the date of grant and other variables 
reclamation expense 
during the year ended december  we incurred million of reclamation expense  which included million of reclamation costs related to the accretion of an asset retirement obligation at the velarde a operations and actual reclamation expenses of million incurred at the el quevar project 
during we completed a revised closure plan for our velarde a operations and recorded a reduction of the accretion of the asset retirement obligation of approximately million which was netted against the expense for the period 
during the year ended december  we incurred million of reclamation costs related to activity at el quevar and the accretion of an asset retirement obligation at the velarde a operations 
we incurred no reclamation expenses for the year ended december  impairment reversal of impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
at december  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million  reducing goodwill carrying value from million to million 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may be impaired 
in the year since the completion of the acquisition of the velarde a operations forecasted future gold and silver prices have decreased by approximately and certain assumptions related to the long term operating plan for the velarde a operations have changed 
as a result of these changes we completed an impairment analysis of the goodwill carrying value  which indicated that goodwill was impaired 
no impairments were recorded during the year ended december  during the year ended december  we recorded a net write up in the carrying value of long lived assets of million related to a previously recorded impairment charge recorded in of million on our held for sale paca pulacayo property 
during january the sale of the paca pulacayo property was completed and a gain of million was recorded in other operating income  net 
also  during we sold an airplane we owned after recording a million impairment charge included in the amount 
other operating income  net 
we recorded other operating income of million for the year ended december  compared to and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net amounts for the three years consist primarily of net gains recorded on the sales of certain fixed assets and non strategic exploration properties 
the increase in other operating income for as compared to and is the result of our efforts to monetize certain of our non strategic mineral properties primarily in mexico and peru 
we will continue our efforts to monetize certain of our non strategic mineral properties during depreciation  depletion and amortization 
during the year ended december  we incurred depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of million compared to and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization includes a million and a million write down of finished goods inventory to estimated net realizable value at december  and  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased beginning in september as a result of the acquisition of the velarde a operations which resulted in a significant increase in property  plant and equipment 
interest and other income 
during the year ended december  we recorded approximately million of interest and other income comprised of a million gain on the sale of the platosa net smelter royalty to excellon  a million reduction of a loss contingency liability and million of income from tolling agreements at our velarde a operations 
we recorded interest and other income of and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amount includes approximately million of net proceeds received from the settlement of an arbitration claim partially offset by a net million loss related to the sale of available for sale investments 
the amount is primarily related to interest earned on cash and investments 
royalty income 
during the year ended december  we recorded royalty income of approximately million compared to approximately million and million recorded during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the royalty income is all related to excellon platosa mine in mexico  on which we retained a net smelter return royalty 
we sold the net smelter royalty to excellon during the second quarter prior to our sale of the royalty  our royalty income varied from period to period depending on production from the mine 
at december  we have no other sources of royalty income 
interest and other expense 
during the year ended december   we recorded interest and other expense of million comprised of million related to interest incurred on a value added tax audit in mexico and million related to losses on investments 
during the year ended december   we recorded interest and other expense of million which included million of interest expense and million of losses on investments 
we had no interest and other expense for the year ended december  gain loss on foreign currency 
we recorded million of foreign currency gain for the year ended december   compared to losses of million and million for the years ended december  and foreign currency gains and losses are primarily related to the effect of currency fluctuations on monetary assets net of liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
such foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities have increased with the acquisition of the velarde a operations 
the gain is primarily related to net operating loss carry forwards in mexico 
the loss was primarily related to the convertible note received from ecu and net operating loss carry forwards in mexico 
gain loss on extinguishment of debt 
for the year ended december  we recorded million for the extinguishment of debt 
the amount was associated with an early termination fee related to a debt obligation acquired in the ecu acquisition 
the debt obligation was fully repaid by the end of we had no such gains or losses for or income taxes 
our income tax benefit for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the amounts are primarily related to an increase in net operating losses and the amortization of the mineral resource at our velarde a operations in mexico 
our income tax provisions of million for the year ended december   consisted primarily of withholding taxes either accrued or paid to bolivia in connection with management services provided to the san crist bal mine 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our aggregate cash and short term investments totaled million and  based on the assumptions described below  we expect to have a cash balance of approximately million at december  in february we completed the sale of certain peruvian exploration properties to a third party for net proceeds of million 
we anticipate completing approximately million in additional exploration property sales during we expect to have sufficient funding to continue our long term business strategy through our cash and short term investment balance at december  of million is million lower than the million in similar assets held at december  due primarily to million in velarde a operations capital and development expenditures  million in operating losses at the velarde a operations  million in exploration expenditures  million on general and administrative activities  million on the el quevar project  and million in additional working capital  primarily related to increased inventories and receivables associated with the velarde a operations  nearly completely offset by total net proceeds of million from the sale of our shares and warrants through an underwritten registered offering and concurrent private placement and million in proceeds from the sale of non strategic property interests and royalty payments 
assuming metals prices of per ounce of silver and  per ounce of gold  we expect to generate in a negative million gross margin at the velarde a operations  which we define as revenue from the sale of metals less costs applicable to the sale of metals exclusive of depreciation and development costs 
with the cash and investment balance at december  of million  the negative million gross margin the velarde a operations and the anticipated proceeds of million from the sale of certain exploration properties  we plan to spend the following amounts during pursuant to our long term business strategy approximately million on capital  project and development costs related to the continued development of the san mateo ramp and other mine development and capital expenditures intended to increase the capacity and productivity of the velarde a operations and plant facilities  approximately million at the el quevar project to fund a small exploration drilling program completed in the first quarter of  maintenance activities  property holding costs  and the continuation of project evaluation costs  approximately million on other exploration activities and property holding costs related to our portfolio of exploration properties located primarily in mexico as we continue strategies to monetize portions of our exploration portfolio  and approximately million on general and administrative costs and million on other working capital 
the actual amount that we spend through year end and the projected year end cash and investment balance may vary significantly from the amounts specified above and will depend on a number of factors  including metals prices  the results of continuing operations and development work at the velarde a operations  the results of continued project assessment work at el quevar and other exploration properties  the success of our efforts to obtain a partner for our el quevar project  and whether we are able to monetize additional portions of our exploration portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the current expenditures planned for the velarde a operations will result in the anticipated amounts of silver and gold production 
a average change in the price of silver during would result in a million change in expected cash flow during the period while a average change in the price of gold during would result in a million change in expected cash flow during the period 
if our metals production is less than anticipated  or metals prices decline from the levels noted previously  we will likely end the year with a lower cash and investment balance than the approximately million currently expected 
critical accounting policies and estimates the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have changed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
discussed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
mineral reserves when and if we determine that a mineral property has proven and probable reserves  subsequent development costs are capitalized to mineral properties 
when mineral properties are developed and operations commence  capitalized costs are charged to operations using the units of production method over proven and probable reserves 
mineralized material as used in this annual report  although permissible under sec guide  does not indicate reserves by sec standards  and therefore all development costs incurred by us are expensed when incurred 
the company cannot be certain that any part of the deposits at the velarde a operations or the yaxtch deposit will ever be confirmed or converted into sec industry guide compliant reserves 
asset retirement obligations we record asset retirement obligations in accordance with auditing standards codification asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations asc  which establishes a uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs 
according to asc  the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
an offsetting asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying value of the assets with which it is associated  and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
during  a third party engineering firm completed a detailed closure plan for our velarde a operations which resulted in a reduction to the original aro estimate  recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of the velarde a operations  of approximately million see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
deferred taxes our deferred tax liability is primarily related to the acquisition of our velarde a operations and was calculated by applying the mexico corporate income tax rate of to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the acquisition of our velarde a operations also resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to certain net operating loss carry forwards available in mexico 
in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  the company presents deferred tax assets net of its deferred tax liabilities on a tax jurisdictional basis on its consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill goodwill is all related to the acquisition of our velarde a operations and is primarily the result of the requirement to record a deferred tax liability for the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at amounts that do not reflect fair value 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may be impaired 
in the year since the completion of the acquisition of the velarde a operations  our forecast of future gold and silver prices has decreased by approximately and certain assumptions related to ore processing throughput rates and other aspects of the long term operating plan for the velarde a operations have changed 
as a result of these changes  and per the guidance of asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  the company completed an impairment analysis of the goodwill carrying value 
the analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired by approximately million during see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill is not deductable for income tax purposes 
business combinations we followed the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with asc  business combinations asc  related to the acquisition of our velarde a operations 
mineral properties and the asset retirement obligation were recorded at estimated fair market value based on valuations performed with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm and a minerals engineering company 
the asset valuations were derived in accordance with the guidance of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  using a combination of income  market and cost approach models depending on the asset 
in applying the appropriate valuation model or models  the valuation consultants employed a variety of economic factors and market data  including discount rates  income tax rates  projections of future metals prices  and third party market surveys 
table of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands of operating leases el quevar and velarde a concession payments the operating lease obligations are related primarily to our corporate headquarters office in golden  colorado  as well as other office leases associated with our exploration activities 
the current corporate headquarters office lease expires in november leases for the other offices expire at various times not exceeding four years 
we make annual maintenance payments of approximately  to the mexico federal government to maintain the velarde a operations concessions and approximately  to the argentine federal government to maintain the el quevar project concessions 
these payments include payments for both owned concessions and concessions held under purchase option agreements 
we cannot currently estimate the life of the velarde a operations or el quevar project 
this table assumes that no annual maintenance payments will be made more than five years after december  if we continue to operate the velarde a operations beyond five years  we expect that we would make annual maintenance payments of approximately  per year for the life of the velarde a mine 
if we continue to develop a mine at the el quevar project  we expect that we would make annual maintenance payments of approximately  per year for the life of the el quevar mine 
from time to time we enter into lease option agreements related to exploration properties that are of interest to us 
these agreements typically contain escalating lease payments required to maintain our exploration rights to the property 
such agreements are not included in the above table because exploration success is historically low and we have the right to terminate the agreements at any time 
for example  at the el quevar project we control the nevado i concession pursuant to a purchase option agreement with a third part concession owner 
our remaining payment on the nevado i option agreement totals  and has been extended to june  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest substantially all of our excess cash in us government and debt securities rated investment grade or better 
the rates received on such investments may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
based on the average cash  restricted cash  investments and restricted investment balances outstanding during the year ended december   a decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a reduction in interest income for the period of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk although most of our expenditures are in us dollars  certain purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in other currencies 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operations 
to reduce this risk  we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign currencies and complete most of our purchases in us dollars 
commodity price risk we are primarily engaged in the operation and further development of properties containing gold  silver  zinc  lead and other minerals 
as a result  decreases in the price of any of these metals have the potential to negatively impact our ability to establish reserves and develop and operate our properties 
for further detail regarding the effect on our expected cash flow from fluctuations in silver and gold prices  see item management discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources above
