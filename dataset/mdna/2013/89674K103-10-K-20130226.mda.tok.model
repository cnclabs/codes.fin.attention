item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to stockholders that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a supplier of high performance modules and components for wireless communications applications 
we design  develop and manufacture advanced high performance rf solutions with gaas  gan  saw and baw technologies for customers worldwide 
we serve growing markets and a diverse customer base of manufacturers building connected mobile devices  g g g cellular base stations  triple play cable solutions  fiber optic networks  wlan  worldwide interoperability for microwave access long term evolution and defense aerospace applications 
we provide our customers with high performance  low cost rf solutions in the mobile devices  networks  and defense aerospace end markets 
our mission is to deliver rf solutions that improve performance and lower the overall cost of our customers applications and we accomplish this through a diversified product portfolio within these markets 
in the mobile devices end market  we provide high performance devices such as integrated modules  duplexers and other filters  small signal components  power amplifiers and switches 
in the networks end market  we are a supplier of an extensive portfolio of gaas microwave monolithic integrated circuits and transistors and saw and baw filter components 
we provide the defense aerospace end market with phased array radar  communications and electronic warfare components and have been recognized as a leader in gan development 
wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities require a significant level of fixed cost due to investments in plant and equipment  labor costs and repair and maintenance costs 
during periods of high demand  factories run at higher utilization rates  generally resulting in improved financial performance 
as the overall rf market has grown in recent years  with continuing desire for content expansion in smartphones  there was increased demand for our products 
in response  we increased capital expenditures in order to add capacity to our factories 
since january  with the increased capacity installed and demand for our products lower than originally anticipated  higher fixed manufacturing costs have adversely affected operating results because factories were not fully utilized 
as a result  our gross margin decreased to in from in we experienced an overall decline in revenue of for compared to  following overall revenue growth in compared to mobile devices represents the largest of our three major end markets 
revenue from the sales of our products in the mobile devices end market for decreased compared to the decrease was primarily due to reduced demand from our largest customer and a decline in sales to some of our smaller customers as demand shifted among the top smartphone suppliers 
revenue from sales of our products in the networks end market increased for compared to this increase was driven primarily by base station expansion and strong demand for our optical products 
growth in data traffic  in the form of streaming video  location services and social networking continues to outpace the capability of the existing infrastructure worldwide 
billions of terabytes of electronic data move around the globe today and traffic continues to expand at an unprecedented rate 
this creates demand for triquint products to support the upgrades and build out of the worldwide wireless and wireline networks 

table of contents revenue from sales of our products in the defense aerospace end market increased in compared to primarily due to the impact of federal program timing  which can result in swings from period to period 
we have continued to win significant production orders during for the latest generation of radar systems such as the f lightning ii joint strike fighter  and the army tpq counter fire target and acquisition radar 
we continue to accelerate the release of new products to support this market which was the primary driver for the increase in defense aerospace revenue in the second half of most notably  we extended our family of industry leading products for radar and communications applications  releasing and shipping new products that provide superior gain and efficiency in a variety of industry standard packages 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
although we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from time to time  which may have a material effect on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  valuation of inventory  which affects gross margin  accounting for income taxes  which affects our tax provision  precious metals reclaim  which affects cost of goods sold and stock based compensation  which affects cost of goods sold and operating expenses and our accounting for litigation and settlement costs 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as the valuation of accounts receivable  reserves for sales returns and allowances however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale of products in the mobile devices  networks  and defense aerospace end markets 
we also receive revenue from foundry services  non recurring engineering fees and cost plus contracts for research and development work  which collectively comprised less than of consolidated revenue for any period 
our distribution channels include our direct sales staff  manufacturers representatives and independent distributors 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title passes to the buyer 
our product sales include warranty provisions that provide that the products will be free of faulty workmanship or defective materials and that the products will conform to our published specifications or other specifications mutually agreed upon with the customer 
if we are unable to repair or replace products returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 
our historical warranty claims experience  and our warranty liability  have not been material 
revenue from our distributors is recognized when the product is sold to the distributors 
sales to our distributors were between and of our total revenue for  and our distributor agreements provide selling prices that are fixed at the date of sale  although in certain circumstances we offer price protection credits  which are specific  of a fixed duration and for which we reserve when offered 
further  the distributor s payment obligation is not contingent on reselling the product 
the distributors take title to the product and bear the risks of ownership  the sales to distributors have economic substance and we can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
we reduce revenue and record reserves for product returns and allowances for price protection and stock rotation based on historical experience or specific identification depending on the contractual terms of the arrangement 
the revenue reserves have remained relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue and we have visibility into the distributors inventory levels and qualifying sales  and are  therefore  able to reasonably estimate the revenue reserves 
we receive periodic reports from customers who utilize inventory hubs and recognize revenue when customers acknowledge they have pulled inventory from our hub  which is the point at which title to the product passes to the customer 
revenue from foundry services and non recurring engineering fees is recorded when the service is completed 
revenue from cost plus contracts is recognized as costs are incurred 

table of contents inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use standard cost methodology to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to stating our inventory at the lower of cost or market  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
we analyze historical usage as well as forecasted demand compared to quantities on hand  and reserve for the excess and identify and record other specific reserves 
in addition  we are currently investigating a potential scrap issue related to the ramp of new gaas capacity 
this issue could potentially result in an additional charge of approximately million during the three months ending march  precious metals reclaim we use historical experience to estimate the amount of reclaim on precious metals used in manufacturing at the end of each period and state the reclaim value at the lower of average cost or market 
the estimated value to be received from precious metal reclaim is included in other current assets 
income taxes we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in preparing our provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax and financial reporting 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we use the with and without approach  disregarding indirect tax impacts  for determining the period in which tax benefits for excess share based deductions are recognized 
net operating losses from prior years reduced federal and state income tax obligations to the extent that we did not have significant income taxes payable at december  or december  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized in future tax returns 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
accounting standards codification asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with gaap 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this statement also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in the interim periods and disclosure 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our net deferred tax assets 
due to strong results in and increased confidence that we will continue to generate taxable income into the foreseeable future  our assessment regarding the potential to realize our deferred tax assets changed 
this assessment required us to exercise significant judgment and make estimates about our ability to generate revenue  gross profit  operating income and taxable income in future periods 
the result was the release of a majority of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against a portion of us and state deferred tax assets  as we do not believe it is more likely than not that these will be realized in future periods 
specifically  the statute of limitations may expire before certain state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are utilized 
the calculation of our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions 
this includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on recognition and measurement criteria prescribed by asc the liabilities are periodically reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness 
changes to our assumptions could cause us to find a revision of estimates appropriate 
such a change in measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations  and court rulings 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
we record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we determine is more likely than not  based upon the technical merits of the position  to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority 
as of december   we were not under audit by any income tax authorities 
tax periods within the statutory period of limitations not previously audited are potentially open for examination by the tax authorities 
potential liabilities associated with these years will be resolved when an event occurs to warrant closure  primarily through the completion of audits by the tax jurisdictions and or the expiration of the statutes of limitation 
to the extent audits or other events result in a material 
table of contents adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized during the period of the event 
we believe that an appropriate estimated liability has been established for potential exposures 
our net unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent interest and penalties would be assessed by taxing authorities of any underpayment of income taxes  such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
realization of the unrecognized tax benefits results in a favorable impact to the effective tax rate 
no provision has been made for the us  state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been permanently reinvested outside the us except existing earnings that have been previously taxed 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested outside the us in the event the foreign subsidiaries repatriate these earnings  the earnings may be subject to us federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
stock based compensation we include stock based compensation costs in our financial statements 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value our options and employee stock purchase plan issuances 
the table below summarizes the stock based compensation expense for  and  included in our consolidated statements of income in millions year ended december  cost of goods sold operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative stock based compensation expense included in operating expenses total stock based compensation expense included in income from operations we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model which requires a number of assumptions  including the expected lives of stock options  the volatility of the public market price for our common stock and interest rates 
the value of the stock based payment award is recognized as stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the award vesting schedule 
we determine our risk free rate assumption based upon the us treasury yield for obligations with contractual lives similar to the expected lives of our option grants and espp subscription periods 
the expected life represents the weighted average period the options are expected to remain outstanding  based upon historical experience 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our historical and anticipated dividend distributions 
the expected volatility is based upon a blend of our historical volatility of our stock price and our exchange traded options for the expected life of the award 
forfeitures are estimated based upon historical and anticipated future experience for the expected life of the award 
litigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions 
there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation  fines and or substantial settlement payments 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation  investigations or settlements is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events  we will record the loss in accordance with gaap 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates  which could require us to record additional costs 
in addition  settlement agreements can be complex and involve multiple elements 
determining the fair value of elements within a multiple element settlement arrangement involves estimates and assumptions determined by management  which if different estimates had been used  could materially change the determination of fair value of the elements 
additionally  certain elements of an arrangement may not be reliably determinable and in these cases  we use a residual approach to value these elements 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion and analysis of operations addresses continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
the table below sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of revenue 
these historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative litigation expense total operating expenses loss income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense recovery impairment of investments in other companies other  net total other income expense  net loss income from continuing operations  before income tax income tax benefit expense net loss income years ended december  and revenue revenue decreased million  or  in  compared to revenue by end market for and  was as follows year ended december  in millions mobile devices networks defense aerospace mobile devices revenue from sales of our products in the mobile devices end market decreased approximately in compared to revenue from the sales of our products in the three primary submarkets of the mobile devices end market was as follows in millions year ended december  g g g connectivity total 
table of contents g g revenue declined primarily as a result of reduced demand from our largest customer 
g revenue declined as we shifted focus away from this product area 
revenue from the sales of our connectivity products declined as a result of a decline in sales to some of our smaller customers as demand shifted among the top smartphone suppliers 
networks revenue from the sales of our products in the networks end market increased approximately for compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue in the transport submarket  driven largely by the strong growth in demand for our optical products 
sales performance of our optical products benefited from the increasing need for faster data transfer rates and the evolution to and gb s standards 
revenue from the sales of our radio access products increased as a result of lte expansion in north america and china 
revenue from the sales of our products in the three primary submarkets of the networks end market was as follows in millions year ended december  radio access transport multi market total defense aerospace revenue from the sales of our products in the defense aerospace end market increased approximately in compared to the increase was primarily the result of and increases in the sales of our radar and communications products  respectively  due to the release and shipment of new products  specifically with one of our largest defense aerospace customers 
significant customers foxconn technology group accounted for and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
while we strive to maintain a strong relationship with our customers  our customers product life cycles are short as they continually develop new products 
the selection process for our products to be included in our customers new products is highly competitive 
there are no guarantees that our products will be included in the next generation of products introduced by foxconn technology group or our other customers 
any significant loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by this  or other significant customers  could have an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
some of our mobile devices end customers use multiple subcontractors for product assembly and test and some of those subcontractors have multiple customers 
therefore  revenues from our customers may not necessarily equal the business of a single mobile devices end customer 
domestic and international revenue revenue from sales to our domestic customers was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in revenue from sales to our international customers was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in as a percentage of total revenue  revenue from sales to our international customers was in  compared to in revenue from sales to our international customers decreased primarily as a result of shifts in market share and consolidation among top smartphone suppliers and lower demand from foxconn technology group which is included as an international customer 
gross profit our gross profit margin as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in  compared to from the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of increased capacity placed into service at the end of and during coupled with lower demand  thereby resulting in a lower factory utilization rate 

table of contents research  development and engineering expenses our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million  or  from the increase was primarily the result of increased spending on material to develop new products  qualification costs and prototypes as well as an increase in employee salary and benefit costs due to higher headcount 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from more medical claims submitted under our self insurance program and an increase in employee salary and benefit costs due to higher headcount 
litigation expense litigation expense in decreased million  or  from as a result of settling the avago litigation in may details regarding this matter are more fully described in part ii  item of our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september  filed with the sec on november  other income expense  net other income  net for was million compared to other expense  net of million for the fluctuation in other income expense  net was primarily due to the million gain recovery on the sale of a previously impaired investment in income tax benefit expense in  we recorded income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax expense of million in the tax benefit was primarily associated with our pre tax loss offset by an accrual for unrecognized tax benefits and the recognition of additional valuation allowance 
the tax expense primarily resulted from us federal and state income tax expense  offset by benefits from the release of certain liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and the recognition of additional tax credits related to research and experimental r e spending 
years ended december  and revenue overall demand for wireless connectivity products from the customer perspective has moved beyond traditional mobile devices to a variety of other applications  including data cards  tablets and various personal media devices 
as a result of this evolution  we have reclassified revenue from the sales of certain products between end markets in results of operations data for revenue increased million or to million in  compared to million in revenue by end market for and was as follows year ended december  in millions mobile devices networks defense aerospace mobile devices revenue from sales of our products in the mobile devices end market increased in compared to the revenue increase resulted primarily from a higher volume of sales of our g g products 
revenue from sales of our g g products increased approximately in  compared to revenue from sales of our connectivity products also increased approximately in  compared to the increases in g g and connectivity products revenue were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from sales of our g products of approximately in  compared to 
table of contents revenue from the sales of our products in the three primary submarkets of the mobile devices end market was as follows in millions year ended december  g g g connectivity total networks revenue from sales of our products in the networks end market decreased approximately in  compared to the decrease was due to revenue from sales of our radio access and multi market products decreasing by and  respectively 
radio access revenue declined as a result of telecommunications companies slowing their investment in the expansion of base station capacity and no new major rollouts of base station infrastructure in emerging markets 
these decreases in sales of radio access and multi market products were partially offset by an increase in revenue from sales of our transport products due to success with our optical product line supporting customer network upgrades to and gb s systems 
revenue from the sales of our products in the three primary submarkets of the networks end market was as follows in millions year ended december  radio access transport multi market total defense aerospace revenue from sales of our products in the defense and aerospace end market decreased approximately in  compared to the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of our radar products due to program completions 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in contract based revenue and sales of communications products 
significant customers foxconn technology group accounted for and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we experienced higher demand than could be supported by the capacity in our factories 
with the capacity constraints  we focused on meeting the demand of certain customers  including foxconn technology group 
in  as a result of allocating sales of available products to these customers and the customers success  revenue resulting from sales to foxconn technology group constituted a larger portion of our total revenue 
domestic and international revenue revenue from sales to our domestic customers was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in revenue from sales to our international customers was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in as a percentage of total revenue  revenue from sales to our international customers was in  compared to in as a percentage of total revenue  revenue from sales to our international customers grew as a result of the increasing demand for our products in the mobile devices end market and the growth in revenue from foxconn technology group which is included as an international customer 
gross profit our gross profit margin as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in  compared to from the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the mix of higher sales of our products in the mobile devices end market  which have lower gross profit compared to the products used in the other end markets and lower utilization in our factories as demand did not keep pace with capacity expansions during the year 

table of contents research  development and engineering expenses our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million  or  from as a percentage of revenue  research development and engineering expense grew nearly percentage points in compared to the increase was primarily due to headcount growth  which led to a combination of higher labor costs and other spending on technical supplies  equipment and materials needed to support additional employees 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in remained relatively flat  increasing less than million  or  compared to litigation expense litigation expense in increased million  or compared to the increase was primarily a result of costs incurred related to the litigation with avago 
refer to part ii  item of our quarterly report on form q for the period ended september  filed with the sec on november  for more details 
other income expense  net other income expense  net in remained relatively flat  with other expense  net of million compared to other income  net of million in income tax benefit expense in  we recorded income tax expense of million  compared to income tax benefit of million in the tax expense primarily resulted from us federal and state income tax expense  offset by benefits from the release of certain liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and the recognition of additional tax credits related to research and experimental r e spending 
the benefit in was primarily attributable to the valuation allowance release which was recorded against the deferred tax assets and the release of certain liabilities due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  partially offset by federal and state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million  or from december  the decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures of million and the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock for million  offset by other balance sheet changes as follows our inventory balance decreased million  or 
the decrease was primarily due to higher inventory turns for the three months ended december  at compared to for the three months ended december   indicating a higher sales volume leading up to the end of compared to we calculated inventory turns using ending inventory and cost of goods sold for the three months ended december  and december  our net property  plant and equipment decreased million  or 
the change was primarily due to depreciation expense of million  which outpaced capital expenditures of million during  which excludes the timing effect of capital expenditure payments in prepaid expenses and accounts payable of million 
the capital expenditures made in were primarily for equipment to support new products and technologies 
our deferred tax assets increased million  or 
of the million in total deferred tax assets  million was classified as current and million was classified as noncurrent 
this increase was primarily related to the pre tax loss in our current liabilities increased million  or 
the increase was primarily related to an increase in variable compensation and the timing effect of capital expenditure payments 

table of contents line of credit on august   we extended our credit agreement the agreement with a syndicated group of lenders  including bank of america  na  as administrative agent and lender 
the agreement provided us with an unsecured revolving syndicated credit facility of million 
our obligations under the agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries 
outstanding amounts are due in full on the maturity date of september  upon the occurrence of certain events of default specified in the agreement  amounts due under the agreement may be declared immediately due and payable 
as of and for the year ended december   there were no amounts outstanding under the agreement 
because there were no borrowings during the respective period  no interest cost was incurred on borrowings during the year ended december  sources of liquidity our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  consisting of million in domestic balances and million in foreign balances together with cash anticipated to be generated from operations and the balance available on our million syndicated credit facility  constitute our principal sources of liquidity 
we believe these sources will satisfy our projected expenditures through the next twelve months 
we intend to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings except for liquidated foreign entities and existing earnings that have been previously taxed 
we are not presently aware of any restrictions on the repatriation of these funds 
if these funds were needed to fund our operations in the us  they could be repatriated 
repatriation of our foreign funds would require board approval and could result in additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes which could be partially offset by net operating losses and or foreign tax credits 
determining the amount of possible future taxes is not practicable 
at this time  we believe our domestic funds  along with the syndicated credit facility  are sufficient to meet our net domestic cash requirements for the next twelve months 
the principal risks to these sources of liquidity are lower than expected earnings or capital expenditures in excess of our expectations  in which case we may be required to finance any shortfall through additional equity offerings  debt financing or credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms 
we continue to invest in expanding capacity  specifically for high performance filters and are expecting capital expenditures of approximately million in  depending upon business needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or december  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december  that will affect our future liquidity in millions payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years operating leases deferred compensation cross licensing liability sabbatical earnout and milestone payment liability other obligations total the amounts presented represent leases of certain equipment  office and manufacturing space under operating leases 
the amounts presented in this line item represent commitments for minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
the amount presented represents the liability for our non qualified deferred compensation plan the plan established in october the plan provides eligible employees and members of the board of directors with the opportunity to defer a specified percentage of their cash compensation 
the deferred earnings are invested at the discretion of each participating employee or director and the deferred compensation we are obligated to deliver is adjusted for increases or decreases in the deferred amount due to such investment 
we include the amounts deferred by the participants and held by 
table of contents us in the other noncurrent assets  net line item of our consolidated balance sheets and our obligation to deliver the deferred compensation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheets 
the cross licensing liability represents a payable under a cross licensing agreement 
the balance represents the estimated commitments for sabbatical payments for all eligible full time employees 
the balance represents the expected earnout and milestone payments related to acquisitions the balance represents the estimated pension liability payable to the employees of our german subsidiary and the estimated obligation related to an lease agreement for assembly and test services in the philippines 
the pension liability becomes payable when the covered employees reach the age of or the liability was acquired through our purchase of the gaas business of infineon in we elected to secure the liability through a reinsurance program supported by us 
we have included the reinsurance receivables of million in the other noncurrent assets  net line item on our consolidated balance sheets and our obligation to deliver the pension obligation in the other long term liabilities line item on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we had approximately million of net tax liabilities  which are included as long term income tax liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
we do not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next twelve months 
further  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash payments required to settle these liabilities and do not believe that the ultimate settlement of these obligations will materially affect our liquidity 
accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued an asu with regard to testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu extends the guidance under the asu described above that was issued in september to impairment tests on indefinite lived intangible assets 
the asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  and early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt this asu in the performance of our annual test for the impairment of long lived assets during the first quarter of we do not anticipate the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk cash equivalents our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale securities and consist of highly rated  short term investments  such as money market funds  in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of these investments are held at fair value 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
further  we do not believe that our results of operations would be materially affected by an immediate change in interest rates 
the following table shows the fair values of our investments as of december  in millions cost fair value cash and cash equivalents available for sale investments foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because we sell our products internationally and have operations in costa rica  singapore  the philippines and germany 
we manage the foreign currency risk of our international sales  purchases of raw materials and equipment and our costa rican  singaporean  philippine and german operations by denominating most transactions in us dollars 
we do not engage in foreign currency hedging
