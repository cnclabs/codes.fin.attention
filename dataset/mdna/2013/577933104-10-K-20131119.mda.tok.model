item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
business overview we provide business process services bps to government health and human services agencies under our mission of helping government serve the people 
our business is focused almost exclusively on administering government sponsored programs such as medicaid  chip  health care reform  welfare to work  medicare  child support and other government programs 
we are one of the largest pure play health and human services administrative providers to governments in the united states  australia  canada  the united kingdom and saudi arabia 
we use our deep domain expertise  repeatable processes and technology solutions to help government agencies run efficient  cost effective programs and to improve program accountability and outcomes  while enhancing the quality of services provided to program beneficiaries 
during the past five years  the company has focused on its core health and human services businesses 
prior to this point  a number of non core businesses were divested or discontinued while operations were expanded in the united states and internationally through a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of companies with complementary capabilities 
we believe that this focus  balanced by a risk management structure  has enabled the company to attain profitable growth in recent years 
the company believes that a combination of its record of results  robust financial performance and global experience makes it well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in its existing markets and elsewhere 
both within the united states and internationally  governments are being challenged by factors that increase social burdens  including ageing populations and demands for health care reform  offset by reduced funds with which to deal with these demands 
we believe that these trends will provide a demand for services that can be met by companies such as maximus 
acquisitions on july   the company acquired health management limited hml  a leading provider of independent health assessments within the united kingdom 
maximus acquired hml in order to expand the company independent medical assessment business and to strengthen the presence of the company health services segment in the united kingdom 
hml provided million of revenue and million of operating income during the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year on april   the company acquired policy studies  inc psi 
psi supports government clients in the administration of a number of health and human services programs exclusively within the united states 
maximus acquired psi  among other reasons  to strengthen its leadership in the administration of public health and human services programs 
the acquired assets and business have been integrated into the company health services and human services segments 
in assessing the performance of our business  we believe that it is helpful to our investors to show organic revenue growth  which represents the increase in revenue from contracts excluding those provided by our acquired businesses 
organic growth is a non gaap number that we believe provides a useful basis for assessing the performance of the business excluding the results of psi and hml 
in order to calculate organic growth  we remove the revenue from the acquired businesses from all periods being compared 
organic growth is not meant to be used in isolation  nor as an alternative to revenue growth as a measure of performance 

table of contents financial overview the company has experienced strong year over year growth in both revenue and operating profit across both segments 
there are a number of drivers of this growth 
the health services segment organic growth has been fuelled by states transferring from medicaid populations to managed care plans  resulting in increased transaction based activity revenues  additional revenues from services provided for the implementation of the affordable care act  and volume growth in our medicare federal appeals business 
the human services segment organic growth has been derived from the ramp up of our contract in the united kingdom and expansion into new overseas markets  including saudi arabia 
the company benefitted from acquired growth from hml in and psi and the company continues to see opportunities to further expand the business 
in particular  the implementation of the affordable care act aca and medicaid expansion in the united states has provided opportunities for maximus related to the federal and state based health insurance exchanges 
maximus estimates that aca has added more than million in new annual contract revenue for the company from the operation of customer contact centers for five states  the district of columbia and the united states federal government 
in addition  maximus is providing eligibility appeals services for the federal exchange and expertise and experience to other states in their preparations for the implementation of aca 
although the company operations have expanded  cash flows from operations have been constrained through the additional requirements for working capital necessitated by the company growth  as well as increases in the time taken by our customers to pay us 
the company free cash flow  which includes cash outflows related to capital expenditures  has also been tempered by the need to invest in the necessary infrastructure primarily associated with new contract awards  particularly in the united states 
overall  the company cash balance has declined by million during fiscal  which includes a cash payment of million related to the acquisition of hml 
sales pipeline at september  was billion  compared to billion at september  at the start of the current year  the company had a significant number of new contracts in start up and these converted opportunities were the principal driver behind the current fiscal year growth in revenue 
the sales pipeline only reflects opportunities where the request for proposal rfp is expected to be released within the next six months 
under most circumstances  contract opportunities that are carried within the pipeline reflect the base contract value and do not include future option periods 
option periods are typically reported in the pipeline six months before they are eligible to be exercised 
for contracts with the united states federal government  it is common to see a single year base contract with multiple options  whereas state  local and international contracts typically have longer base periods 
our assessment of pipeline reflects only opportunities that the company is pursuing or planning to pursue and should not be considered as indicative of guaranteed future revenues 
international businesses the company operates in international locations and  accordingly  transacts business in currencies other than the united states dollar  principally the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the british pound and the saudi arabian riyal 
during the year ended september   the company earned approximately of revenues and operating income from foreign subsidiaries 
at september  
table of contents  approximately of the company assets are held by foreign subsidiaries 
international business exposes the company to certain risks 
international tax rules may limit the use of cash in other parts of the business without increasing significant additional tax penalties or withholding 
the company mitigates this risk by maintaining sufficient capital within its foreign subsidiaries to support the short term and long term capital requirements of the businesses 
the company establishes its legal entities to make the most efficient use of tax laws and holding companies to minimize this exposure 
the company may be subject to exposure from foreign currency fluctuations 
the company foreign subsidiaries typically incur costs in the same currency as they earn revenues  thus limiting the company exposure to unexpected currency fluctuations 
the operations of the us business do not depend upon cash flows from foreign subsidiaries 
the company revenues  profits and asset balances  including cash balances  are affected by fluctuations in the currencies noted above 
when the united states dollar is strengthening  as it was during fiscal year  our international operations will contribute less revenue and profit than would have been the case had the currencies remained consistent 
in assessing the performance of our business  we believe that it is helpful to our investors to show constant currency revenue growth  which represents the increase in revenue from contracts excluding the effects of year over year currency fluctuations 
constant currency growth is a non gaap number that we believe provides a useful basis for assessing the performance of the business excluding the unpredictable effects of foreign exchange movements 
in order to calculate constant currency  we calculate revenue for all international businesses using the exchange rates used in the prior year 
constant currency growth is not meant to be used in isolation  nor as an alternative to revenue growth as a measure of performance 

table of contents summary of consolidated results the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ends indicated  selected statements of operations data year ended september  dollars in thousands  except per share data revenue gross profit gross profit margin selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue operating income excluding acquisition related expenses and legal and settlement expenses and recoveries operating income excluding legal and settlement expense as a percentage of revenue acquisition related expenses legal and settlement expense recovery operating income from continuing operations operating margin from continuing operations interest and other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes tax rate income from continuing operations  net of income taxes income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income basic earnings per share income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations diluted earnings per share the company common stock was split two for one during the fiscal year 
all results presented in these financial statements have been adjusted for this stock split 
the following provides an overview of the significant elements of our consolidated statements of operations 
as our business segments have different factors driving revenue growth and profitability  the sections that follow cover these segments in greater detail 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue increased to  million 
on a constant currency basis  growth would have been 
organic growth was 
much of the growth came from our health services segment  driven by new work  the expansion of existing contracts and the acquisitions of psi and hml 
gross profit increased to million  representing a profit margin of compared to in the prior year 
gross profit margins within the health services segment was driven principally by the accretive nature of the higher volumes in our federal medicare appeals business 
gross profit margins declined within our human services segment  driven in part by additional costs within our australian business 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a consists of costs related to general management  marketing and administration 
these costs include salaries  benefits  bid and proposal efforts  travel  recruiting  continuing education  employee training  non chargeable labor costs  facilities costs  printing  reproduction  communications  equipment depreciation  intangible amortization and legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business 
our sg a as a percentage of revenue has remained broadly consistent between fiscal year and operating income from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended september   compared to the prior year 
excluding the acquisition related expenses and legal and settlement expense  growth would have been 
this growth was driven by the acquisitions of psi and hml  new work in our health services segment and million of income related to a terminated contract 
interest and other income declined due to decreases in our international cash balances  which generated the majority of our interest income 
these funds were used to acquire hml 
our tax rate for fiscal year was  compared to in the prior year tax rate includes a charge of million to correct an error from prior years  without which the rate would have been 
during fiscal year  the company received the benefit of increased profits in locations with lower tax rates than the united states  particularly in the united kingdom  where the ramp up of the uk contract and the acquisition of hml resulted in profits taxed at lower rates 
we anticipate that our tax rate will decline slightly during fiscal year  primarily driven by anticipated profit outlook by jurisdiction 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue increased to  million 
on a constant currency basis  growth would have been 
organic growth was 
organic growth was driven by the health services segment  which was offset by declines in revenue from our international operations in the human services segment 
gross profit increased to million  representing a profit margin of compared to in the prior year 
although gross profit margins did not move significantly at a consolidated level  gross profit margins in the health services segment declined and those in the human services segment increased  as discussed in more detail below 
sg a increased by to million 
this increase is in excess of the increase in revenue and was caused by a number of factors including significant business development activity  including the preparation of bids and proposals  and the acquisition of psi  which resulted in additional intangible asset amortization expense 
operating income from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended september   compared to the prior year 
excluding the acquisition related expenses and legal and settlement expense  growth would have been 
this growth was driven by the acquisition of 
table of contents psi  new work in our health services segment and growth in our human services segment 
the sections below cover segment results in more detail 
interest and other income increased primarily due to increases in cash balances in jurisdiction with higher interest rates than the united states 
this increase in cash was driven by strong international cash flows 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared with in the tax charge in fiscal year included a charge of million to correct an error from prior years  without which the rate would have been 
this increase was driven by a greater share of the company profits being recorded in the united states  which has a higher corporate tax rate than other jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the increase in profits in the united states was driven by organic growth  the acquisition of psi  which conducted all of its business within the united states  and the anticipated decline in profits in the united kingdom  which is discussed below 
income from continuing operations  net of income taxes  declined to million 
the benefits from the company organic growth and acquisitions were offset by the significantly higher tax rate 
acquisition related expenses and legal and settlement expenses acquisition related expenses are direct costs incurred as a consequence of the acquisition of hml in  psi in and various other acquisitions that were not completed 
these costs include legal fees  brokerage fees  due diligence  valuation reports  contract terminations related to redundant support services and severance 
legal and settlement expense recovery consists of costs  net of reimbursed insurance claims  related to significant legal settlements and non routine legal matters  including future probable legal costs estimated to be incurred in connection with those matters 
legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
legal and settlement expenses recoveries are summarized below in thousands year ended september  insurance recoveries employee lawsuit client indemnification other legal and settlement expense recovery during fiscal year  the company agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by a former employee for million and agreed to pay million relating to client indemnification of funds misappropriated by a former employee 
during fiscal year  the company insurance provider reimbursed the company for part of the latter claim 
the insurance recovery in fiscal year relates to a litigation settlement in fiscal year during the fiscal year  the company reversed a legal expense previously recognized in fiscal year for a matter that concluded without liability to the company 
we discuss operating income from continuing operations excluding acquisition related expenses and legal and settlement expenses and recoveries 
operating income excluding acquisition related expenses and legal and settlement expenses and recoveries is a non gaap number 
we believe that excluding acquisition related expenses and legal and settlement expenses and recoveries provides a framework for comparing the performance of the business between periods as these charges do not 
table of contents reflect the underlying performance of the business 
this non gaap number should not be used in isolation  nor as an alternative to operating income as a measure of performance 
health services segment the health services segment provides a variety of business process services for state  provincial and federal programs  such as aca  medicaid  chip  medicare and the health insurance british columbia program 
year ended september  dollars in thousands revenue gross profit operating income gross profit margin operating profit margin fiscal year versus fiscal year revenue increased by to million 
growth was not significantly affected by year over year fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
organic growth was 
gross profit increased by and operating profit increased by  with margins increasing year over year 
the results for the segment were driven by new work  particularly that associated with aca  expansion of existing contracts  including strong volumes in our federal medicare appeals practice  and the benefit of a full year of psi business  as well as three months of hml business 
the expansion of the gross and operating profit margins was driven principally by the accretive nature of the higher volumes in our federal medicare business 
we expect to see growth in fiscal year through the full year benefit of our contracts associated with aca 
the health services segment should also receive the benefit of a full year of hml business 
we expect lower margins in the health services segment in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this is driven by an expected increase in federal cost reimbursable contracts  which tend to have lower margins  highly accretive contract work ending  and the launch of a loss making contract that was acquired as part of the psi acquisition 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenue increased by  or on a constant currency basis 
organic growth was 
gross profit increased by and operating profit increased by  with margins declining year over year 
the results for the segment were driven by the expansion of medicaid managed care  where the transfer of individuals to managed care plans increases the transaction based revenues recorded by the company  increasing revenue but reducing margins  as this work is less accretive than our remaining portfolio of contracts  and the acquisition of psi  which increased revenue but reduced operating profit margins due to a portfolio of lower margin contracts 

table of contents human services segment the human services segment includes a variety of business process services  case management  job training and support services for programs such as welfare to work programs  child support  k special education and other specialized consulting services 
year ended september  dollars in thousands revenue gross profit operating income gross profit margin operating profit margin the results for the human services segment in fiscal year were affected by a one time benefit from the termination of a system integration contract acquired with psi 
the termination resulted in one time  non cash benefits to revenue of million and to gross and operating profit of million 
although contract terminations for convenience do occur within our business  they are infrequent 
in addition  this termination was unusual due to the significant effect of the transaction as it involved deferred revenue from the psi acquisition and does not reflect the underlying operations of the company 
we have provided a reconciliation below showing our results excluding the effect of this contract 
results for human services segment for year ended september  revenue gross profit operating profit dollars in thousands as reported effect of terminated contract results excluding the effect of the terminated contract profit margins excluding the effect of the terminated contract 
the numbers in the table above are non gaap numbers  but we believe that the presentation of these numbers provides a useful basis for assessing the performance of this segment compared to prior periods or the results of our competitors 
however  these non gaap numbers should not be considered in isolation nor as alternatives to their gaap equivalents as measures of performance 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenue increased to million 
on a constant currency basis  growth would have been and organic growth was 
gross profit increased and operating profit increased 
excluding the effect of the termination of the contract  revenue growth was 
results for the segment were driven by a number of factors the termination of the contract noted above  which resulted in significant one time benefits to revenues  profits and profit margins  our contract in the united kingdom has reached a level of maturity where the deferred nature of the fees for achieving sustained employment more closely matches the ongoing operating cost of the contract  
table of contents other international growth in saudi arabia and canada  which was offset by declines in our australian business 
the declines in australia were driven by required  permanent changes in the contract including increased documentation and regulatory oversight  the benefit of a full year of revenue from psi  which resulted in increased revenue 
however  profit margins on the united states human services business tend to earn lower margins than our international businesses  and revenue and margins within the united states were adversely affected by the absence of a benefit received in fiscal year from a fixed price program that contributed million to revenue and profit associated with a revision in the estimate of the cost to complete this contract 
we are forecasting that fiscal year will be fairly flat for revenue compared to fiscal year this assumes that growth in our international operations will be offset by a decline in the united states  largely related to the successful completion of a large  multi year  fixed price contract 
in both fiscal years and  the segment enjoyed unusual benefits from two contracts that seem unlikely to be repeated in fiscal year we believe the full year segment operating margins will be towards the lower end of our stated range of 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenue increased to million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year on a constant currency basis  the growth would have been 
excluding acquisition driven growth from psi  segment revenues would have declined 
gross profit increased and operating profit increased  resulting in increases to both profit margins 
the results for the segment were driven by a number of factors 
the acquisition of psi contributed million of revenue 
a united kingdom contract  which was in place for much of fiscal year  was terminated and replaced with the work programme contract  resulting in a decline in revenue and profit 
this termination and subsequent decline in revenues was anticipated and reflects the back ended payment structure of the work programme  where a greater share of revenue is earned when individuals enter into sustained employment  typically considered to be a period of six months 
this decline in revenue also reduced operating profit margins 
in australia  a number of short term contracts were completed and our principal contract also recorded lower volumes  resulting in reduced revenues  profits and margins 
in the united states  a fixed price contract received the benefit of million to revenue and profit  whereas it had incurred a charge of million in fiscal year this resulted in a benefit to revenue and profit and made a significant contribution to our gross and operating profit margins in this period 
discontinued operations during the year ended september   the company incurred legal costs in defending a proceeding related to a discontinued operation 
the company prevailed in that proceeding  but the plaintiff has appealed and the company may continue to incur costs in defending itself due to claims arising from this  or any other  discontinued operation 
although the company estimates and accrues anticipated costs relating to such actions  and tries to negotiate indemnifications against liabilities arising from discontinued operations where possible  the company is unable to anticipate every potential legal claim  and might incur legal defense costs 

table of contents the company results in fiscal year include the effects of the sale of our erp business  which took place during fiscal year during fiscal year  the company resolved a dispute with the buyer of the business and recorded a pre tax loss of million 
the company continues to record gains on the sale of unison maximus  inc  a business which was sold in may the consideration for the sale included a promissory note which is fully reserved 
small payments continue to be received on this note  but owing to uncertainties over the collectability of the full balance  the company has only recorded a gain on sale where recovery is considered assured  which is typically when cash payments are received 
the company recorded gains on sale of million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years  the company has relied upon cash flows from operations to fund operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases and dividends 
both domestic and overseas locations have remained self sufficient in funding operations and capital resources 
the company expects to be able to continue to fund operations and capital expenditures from operating cash flows but has a line of credit available if necessary to fund operations 
in prior periods  the company has faced short term payment delays from state customers  all of which were ultimately recovered 
the company believes its liquidity and capital positions are adequate to weather short term payment delays 
in the event of more protracted delays  the company may be required to seek additional capital sources  amend payment terms or take other actions 
extended payment delays could adversely affect the company cash flows  operations and profitability 
at september   the company held million in cash and cash equivalents 
approximately of these funds are held in overseas locations  principally in canada and australia 
if we were to transfer these funds to the united states  the company could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes 
we have no requirement to repatriate these funds as we believe we have access to sufficient funds in the united states to fund our operations  capital outlays  dividends  share repurchases or any other requirements 
accordingly  we do not intend to repatriate these funds held overseas and we have not attempted to quantify the charges that might arise if we were to make this transaction 
the charges would vary based upon tax legislation in the united states and in the overseas jurisdictions as well as the manner and timing of these transactions 
the company currently has no debt  with the exception of a million interest free loan from the atlantic innovation fund of canada  the funds of which must be used for certain investment projects in prince edward island 
at september   the company has access to up to million from a credit facility in the united states 
these funds are available to cover short term cash requirements and other potential capital outlays  including share repurchases and acquisitions 
also at september   the company had letters of credit totaling million and performance bond commitments totaling million 
the letters of credit and performance bonds are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations have been satisfied 
although the triggering events vary from contract to contract  in general we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default of our obligations under each contract  the probability of which we believe is remote 
our primary source of cash is revenues received from customers 
our collection of cash is driven by billing schedules and payment terms that can vary based upon a number of factors  including contract type 
in certain contracts  particularly international welfare to work contracts  cash receipts are structured around our performance  which may take several quarters to be realized 
in these cases  contracts will typically result in cash outflows over the early period of the contract and the ultimate cash flows of the contract will be subject to risk until the performance outcomes are known 
certain contracts require significant financial outlays in terms of capital assets and in start up costs 
these 
table of contents expenditures result in our use of cash which may be reimbursed during the set up phase or over the life of the contract 
related revenue may also be deferred during the set up phase 
at september   management considered that the net book value of all capital assets  including deferred contract costs  was less than the expected future cash flows related to these assets 
the company acquisition of hml in july resulted in a net cash payment of million  which was paid from cash held outside the united states 
the company acquisition of psi in april resulted in a net cash payment of million  using cash based in the united states 
the following table provides a summary of our cash flow information for the three years ended september  year ended september  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities continuing operations operating activities discontinued operations investing activities continuing operations financing activities continuing operations effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year  which was slightly higher than cash flows in fiscal year the operating cash flows have been dampened by delays in payments from customers  as well as a general increase in working capital requirements as the business expands 
we do not anticipate these delays in payments to continue but the level of receivables continues to be well within our expected range 
cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year  an increase of million from fiscal year the increase was primarily driven by increases in cash receipts from customers 
this was driven by increases in revenue as well as the timing of cash receipts on certain projects which did not directly correspond with revenue recognition 
cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations in fiscal year relates to arbitration charges on a discontinued line of business 
in fiscal year  the company made payments related to the sale of the company erp division in september  notably the settlement of payroll and other liabilities that were not transferred to the buyers of the business 
cash used in investing activities includes million of net cash outflow related to acquisitions in fiscal year and million in fiscal year these are principally related to the acquisitions of hml and psi respectively  with some benefits arising from other transactions 
excluding these events  the principal driver of this cash outflow was the company capital expenditures  which increased significantly during fiscal year as a consequence of the significant additional requirements for new contract start ups  principally within the united states and canada 
future investing cash flows will be contingent upon acquisition activity and new business awards 
cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
these cash flows were principally driven by repurchases of common stock of million  million and million  respectively 
other fluctuations have been caused by an increase in the company tax benefit on option exercises and rsu vestings  offset by increases in withholding payments related to employee tax liabilities 
these increases reflect the increase in the share price since the grant date for many of the rsus that vested in fiscal year 
table of contents the detrimental effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents of million in the fiscal year reflects the strengthening of the united states dollar against the australian dollar 
to supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis  we use the non gaap measure of free cash flow from continuing operations to analyze the funds generated from operations 
we believe free cash flow from continuing operations is a useful basis for comparing our performance with our competitors 
the presentation of non gaap free cash flow from continuing operations is not meant to be considered in isolation  nor as an alternative to net income as an indicator of performance  nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
we calculate free cash flow from continuing operations as follows year ended september  dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities continuing operations purchases of property and equipment capitalized software costs free cash flow from continuing operations repurchases of the company common stock the board of directors has authorized the repurchase  at management discretion  of specified amounts of the company common stock 
the board has also authorized the use of option exercise proceeds for the repurchase of the company common stock 
during the years ended september   and  the company repurchased   and  common shares at a cost of million  million and million  respectively 
up to million remained available for repurchase under the most recent board authorization as of september  dividend on october   the company board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of for each share of the company common stock outstanding 
the dividend will be paid on november  to shareholders of record on november  based on the number of shares outstanding  the payment will be approximately million 
obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at september  that require the company to make future cash payments in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands operating leases long term debt deferred compensation plan liabilities total deferred compensation plan liabilities are typically payable at times elected by the employee at the time of deferral 
however  early withdrawal is permitted for certain conditions  including employee hardship or termination  which may accelerate the payment of these liabilities 

table of contents due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the company unrecognized income tax benefits at september   we are unable to reasonably estimate settlements with taxing authorities 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of approximately million  of which approximately million is related interest and penalties 
see note income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on income taxes 
the contractual obligations table also omits our liabilities with respect to acquisition related contingent consideration 
as part of the acquisition arrangement for deltaware systems  inc  which was acquired in fiscal year  we agreed to pay up to million canadian dollars in the event that certain sales targets are reached up to at present  we have accrued million based upon a probability weighted assessment of our likely payments under this arrangement 
at this time  no sales arrangements have been entered into which would require a payment to be made 
see note business combinations of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this balance 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have material off balance sheet risk or exposure to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
additionally  although on certain contracts we are bound by performance bond commitments and standby letters of credit  we have not had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds 
also  we do not speculate in derivative transactions 
effects of inflation as measured by revenue  approximately of our business in fiscal year was conducted under cost reimbursable contracts that adjust revenue to cover costs increased by inflation 
approximately of the business was time and material contracts where labor rates are often fixed for several years 
we generally have been able to price these contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
the remaining portions of our contracts are fixed price and performance based and are typically priced to account for the likely inflation from period to period to mitigate the risk of our business being adversely affected by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we consider the accounting policies below to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because of the need to use significant judgment in recording the balance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue is generated from contracts with various pricing arrangements  including performance based criteria  constituting approximately of total revenue in fiscal year  fixed price  costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost plus  and time and materials 

table of contents we recognize revenue on arrangements as work is performed and amounts are earned 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services have been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability of revenue is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on performance based contracts when earned  which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers 
this may result in revenue being recognized in irregular increments 
revenue on cost plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate of the negotiated fee earned 
for certain contracts  the nature and allocation of costs incurred is subject to judgment and differing amounts could be recorded if underlying assumptions or estimates were to change 
the company closely monitors its methodology for recording cost plus revenue and incorporates the results of client audits where applicable to refine these estimates 
changes in estimates may result in significant changes to revenue 
we recognize revenue on fixed priced contracts when earned  as services are provided 
revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
the timing of expense recognition may result in irregular profit margins 
for certain fixed price contracts  primarily systems design  development and implementation  we generally recognize revenue based upon costs incurred to date and our anticipated gross profit 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and costs is recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided for in full in the period in which such losses become known 
this policy may result in revenues being recognized at different points from amounts being billable 
such contracts require a number of estimates including the timing of future work to be performed  the future costs of labor and materials and  where considered to be estimable and probable  adjustments to revenue from change orders or contract incentives 
changes to these estimates may result in changes to revenue and project profitability 
where the company enters into contracts where significant uncertainty exists over the ability of management to estimate the future costs  the company will typically defer all revenue until such time as future costs are estimable or the system implementation is complete 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized based on hours worked and expenses incurred 
where contracts have multiple deliverables  we evaluate these deliverables at the inception of each contract and as each item is delivered 
as part of this evaluation  we consider whether a delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis and whether the delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control  if a general right of return exists 
where deliverables  or groups of deliverables  have both of these characteristics  we treat each deliverable item as a separate element in the arrangement  allocate a portion of the allocable arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method to each element and apply the relevant revenue recognition guidance to each element 
the allocation of revenue to individual elements requires judgment as  in many cases  we do not provide directly comparable services or products on a standalone basis 
business combinations and goodwill the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
the excess balance is recorded as goodwill 
accounting for business combinations requires the use of judgment in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to allocate the purchase price of entities acquired 
our estimates of these fair values are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable and  where appropriate  include assistance from third party appraisal firms 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 

table of contents this process requires judgment in identifying our reporting units  appropriately allocating goodwill to these reporting units and assessing the fair value of these reporting units 
at july   the company performed the annual impairment test and determined that there had been no impairment of goodwill 
in performing this assessment  the company utilizes an income approach 
such an approach requires estimation of future operating cash flows including business growth  utilization of working capital and discount rates 
the valuation of the business as a whole is compared to the company market capital at the date of the acquisition in order to verify the calculation 
in all cases  we determined that the fair value of our reporting units was significantly in excess of our carrying value to the extent that a decline in fair value in any reporting unit would not have resulted in an impairment charge 
long lived assets excluding goodwill the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
our review is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related customer project 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount  we recognize a non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to equal projected future discounted cash flows 
no impairment charges were recorded in the three years ending september  contingencies 
from time to time  we are involved in legal proceedings  including contract and employment claims  in the ordinary course of business 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies  as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly 
the amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy 
income taxes 
the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the assumptions and estimates used in preparing these calculations may change over time and may result in adjustments that will affect our tax charge 
at september   the company overseas subsidiaries held approximately million of cumulative earnings 
we do not provide for us income taxes on these undistributed earnings as we do not have the intention or the need to repatriate these funds 
if we were to transfer these funds to the united states  the company would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes 
we have not attempted to quantify the charges that might arise if we were to make this transaction 
the charges would vary based upon tax legislation in the united states and the other overseas jurisdictions as well as the manner and timing in which maximus would make these transactions 
the amount of taxes that may be applicable on earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings
