table of contents key industry and business trends we operate primarily within the large and growing us professional beauty supply industry 
potential growth in the industry is expected to be driven by increases in consumer demand for hair color and hair care products 
we believe the following key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our business and our financial results going forward high level of marketplace fragmentation 
the us salon channel is highly fragmented with nearly  salons and barbershops 
given the fragmented and small scale nature of the salon industry  we believe that salon operators will continue to depend on full service exclusive distributors and open line channels for a majority of their beauty supply purchases 
growth in booth renting and frequent stocking needs 
salon professionals primarily rely on just in time inventory due to capital constraints and a lack of warehouse and shelf space at salons 
in addition  booth renters  who comprise a significant percentage of total us salon professionals  are often responsible for purchasing their own supplies 
historically  booth renters have significantly increased as a percentage of total salon professionals  and we expect this trend to continue 
given their smaller individual purchases and relative lack of financial resources  booth renters are likely to be dependent on frequent trips to professional beauty supply stores  like bsg and sally beauty supply 
we expect that these factors will continue to drive demand for conveniently located professional beauty supply stores 
increasing use of exclusive label products 
we offer a broad range of exclusive label professional beauty products  primarily in our sally beauty supply segment 
as our lines of exclusive label products have matured and become better known in our retail stores  we have seen an increase in sales of these products 
generally  our exclusive label products have higher gross margins for us than the leading third party branded products and  accordingly  we believe that the growth in sales of these products will likely enhance our overall gross margins 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
favorable demographic and consumer trends 
we expect the aging baby boomer population to drive future growth in professional beauty supply sales through an increase in the usage of hair color and hair loss products 
additionally  continuously changing fashion related trends that drive new hair styles are expected to result in continued demand for hair styling products 
changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance 
our continued success depends largely on our ability to anticipate  gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty products 
we continuously adapt our marketing and merchandising initiatives in an effort to expand our market reach or to respond to changing consumer preferences 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the marketplace for beauty products and changing consumer demands  our business could suffer 
please see risk factors we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and buying trends or manage our product lines and inventory commensurate with consumer demand 
international growth strategies 
a key element of our growth strategy depends on our ability to capitalize on international growth opportunities and to grow our current level of non us operations 
for example  during the fiscal year ended september  our international company operated stores increased from stores to stores 
in addition  we have completed a number of international acquisitions over the past three years that increased our european and south american footprint 
we intend to continue to identify and evaluate non us acquisition and or organic international growth opportunities 
our ability to grow our non us operations  integrate our new non us acquisitions and successfully pursue additional non us acquisition and or organic international growth opportunities may be affected by business  legal  regulatory and economic risks 
please see risk factors we may not be able to successfully identify acquisition 
table of contents candidates or successfully complete desirable acquisitions  if we acquire any businesses in the future  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business or have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to conduct business in international marketplaces may be affected by legal  regulatory and economic risks 
continuing consolidation 
there is continuing consolidation among professional beauty product distributors and professional beauty product manufacturers 
we plan to continue to examine ways in which we can benefit from this trend  including the evaluation of opportunities to shift business from competitive distributors to the bsg network as well as seeking opportunistic  value added acquisitions which complement our long term growth strategy 
we believe that suppliers are increasingly likely to focus on larger distributors and retailers with a broader scale and retail footprint 
we also believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend as well as participate in the ongoing consolidation at the distributor retail level 
however  changes often occur in our relationships with suppliers that may materially affect the net sales and operating earnings of our business segments 
consolidation among suppliers could exacerbate the effects of these relationship changes and could increase pricing pressures 
for example  l oreal has acquired distributors that compete with bsg in the midwest  southeast and west coast regions of the us and  as a result  l oreal directly competes with bsg in certain geographic areas 
if l oreal or any of our other suppliers acquired other distributors or suppliers that conduct significant business with bsg  we could lose related revenue 
there can be no assurance that bsg will not lose further revenue over time including within its franchise based business due to potential losses of additional products as well as from the increased competition from distribution networks affiliated with any of our suppliers 
please see risk factors the beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating and we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
relationships with suppliers 
sally beauty supply and bsg  and their respective suppliers are dependent on each other for the distribution of beauty products 
we do not manufacture the brand name or exclusive label products we sell 
we purchase our products from a limited number of manufacturers 
as is typical in distribution businesses particularly in our industry  these relationships are subject to change from time to time including the expansion or loss of distribution rights  including exclusive rights  in various geographies and the addition or loss of product lines 
since we purchase products from many manufacturers on an at will basis  under contracts which can generally be terminated without cause upon days notice or less or which expire without express rights of renewal  such manufacturers could discontinue sales to us at any time or upon the expiration of the distribution period 
some of our contracts with manufacturers may be terminated by such manufacturers if we fail to meet specified minimum purchase requirements 
in such cases  we do not have contractual assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products and vendors may change the terms upon which they sell 
infrequently  a supplier will seek to terminate a distribution relationship through legal action 
changes in our relationships with suppliers occur often and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating profits 
we expect to continue to expand our product line offerings and to gain additional distribution rights over time through either further negotiation with suppliers or by acquisitions of existing distributors 
although we focus on developing new revenue and cost management initiatives to mitigate the negative effects resulting from unfavorable changes in our supplier relationships  there can be no assurance that our efforts will continue to completely offset the loss of these or other distribution rights 
please see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
high level of competition 
sally beauty supply competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail outlets  including local and regional open line beauty supply 
table of contents stores  professional only beauty supply stores  mass merchandisers  on line retailers  drug stores and supermarkets  as well as salons retailing hair care items 
bsg competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail suppliers and manufacturers selling professional beauty products directly to salons and individual salon professionals 
we also face competition from authorized and unauthorized retailers and internet sites offering professional salon only products 
the increasing availability of unauthorized professional salon products in large format retail stores such as drug stores  grocery stores and others could also have a negative impact on our business 
please see risk factors the beauty products distribution industry is highly competitive and is consolidating 
economic conditions 
we appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of professional beauty products sold directly to retail consumers  and salons and salon professionals 
historically  these factors have provided us with reduced exposure to downturns in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
however  a downturn in the economy  especially for an extended period of time  could adversely impact consumer demand of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services  particularly affecting our electrical products category and our full service sales business 
in addition  higher freight costs resulting from increases in the cost of fuel  especially for an extended period of time  may impact our expenses at levels that we cannot pass through to our customers 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
please see risk factors the health of the economy in the channels we serve may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
controlling expenses 
another important aspect of our business is our ability to control costs by right sizing the business and maximizing the efficiency of our business structure 
please see risk factors we are not certain that our ongoing cost control plans will continue to be successful 
opening new stores 
our future growth strategy depends in part on our ability to open and profitably operate new stores in existing and additional geographic areas 
in the us and canada  the capital requirements to open a sally beauty supply or bsg store  excluding inventory  average approximately  and  respectively  with the capital requirements for stores in other geographic areas costing less or substantially more depending upon the marketplace 
we may not be able to open all of the new stores we plan to open and any new stores we open may not be profitable  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors if we are unable to profitably open and operate new stores  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
changes to our information technology systems 
as our operations grow in both size and scope  we will continuously need to improve and upgrade our information systems and infrastructure while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure 
the expansion of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial  operational and technical resources in advance of any increase in the volume of our business  with no assurance that the volume of business will increase 
for example  we are in the process of designing and implementing a standardized enterprise resource planning erp system internationally  which we anticipate will be completed over the next few years 
in addition  we are currently implementing a point of sale system upgrade program in several areas primarily in our sally beauty supply operations in the us  which we anticipate will provide significant benefits  including enhanced tracking of customer sales and store inventory activity 
these and any other required upgrades to our information systems and information technology or new technology  now or in the future  will require that our management and resources be diverted from our core business to assist in completion of these projects 
many of our systems are proprietary  and as a result our options are limited in seeking third party assistance with the operation and upgrade of those systems 
there can 
table of contents be no assurance that the time and resources our management will need to devote to these upgrades  service outages or delays due to the installation of any new or upgraded technology and customer issues therewith  or the impact on the reliability of our data from any new or upgraded technology will not have a material adverse effect on our financial reporting  business  financial condition or results of operations 
please see risk factors we may be adversely affected by any disruption in our information technology systems

other significant items derivative instruments as a multinational corporation  we are subject to certain market risks including changes in market interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
we may consider a variety of practices in the ordinary course of business to manage these market risks  including  when deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency options  collars and forwards hereafter  foreign exchange contracts 
currently  we do not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes

our primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  the chilean peso  and the mexican peso 
in addition  from time to time we may have exposure to changes in the exchange rates for the british pound sterling versus the euro in connection with the sale of products and services among certain european subsidiaries of the company 
our various foreign currency exposures at times offset each other  sometimes providing a natural hedge against foreign currency risk 
in connection with the remaining foreign currency risk  the company from time to time uses foreign exchange contracts to effectively fix the foreign currency exchange rate applicable to specific anticipated foreign currency denominated cash flows  thus limiting the potential fluctuations in such cash flows resulting from foreign currency market movements 

table of contents the company uses foreign exchange contracts including  at september   foreign currency options with an aggregate notional amount of million to manage the exposure to the us dollar resulting from certain of our sinelco group subsidiaries purchases of merchandise from third party suppliers
