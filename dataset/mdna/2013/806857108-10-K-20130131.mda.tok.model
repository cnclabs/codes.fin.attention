risk factors of this form k 
executive overview schlumberger revenue reached a new high of billion in an increase of over driven by robust exploration and development both offshore and in key land markets 
outside north america  revenue grew  while north america revenue grew  with strong offshore activity in the us gulf of mexico outweighing a challenging land market 
global demand for oil recorded annual growth of some million barrels per day for the second year running following the exceptionally strong recovery of lower demand in the oecd countries through energy efficiency gains tempered stronger growth in the non oecd economies and in china in particular 
oil supply grew by more than one million barrels per day in north america as light tight oil production accelerated although this was partially offset by decline in a number of non opec countries 
within opec  production in libya continued to recover leading to a slight increase in spare capacity  which remained relatively slim 
this  together with ongoing geopolitical tension and the associated risk of supply disruption  continued to support oil prices 
for natural gas  the three main markets continued to behave independently 
in north america  storage levels remained at record highs throughout the year as a result of growing domestic production and mild weather that pushed spot prices to year lows in april 
toward the end of the year  however  storage levels returned closer to historical averages 
in asia  natural gas prices remained close to oil parity  supported by sustained high demand in japan following the nuclear incident and by strong demand in china 
in europe  lower demand was offset by declining domestic supply and the effect of demand in asia 
in this environment  schlumberger achieved a record high for revenue  with strong contributions from all areas 
international performance was led by the europe cis africa area  where revenue was up  mainly from strength in russia and in the nigeria gulf of guinea  angola  east africa and north sea geomarkets 
in latin america  revenue grew by  driven by integrated project management contracts on land  and activity for wireline services and drilling group product and services offshore mainly in the mexico central america  venezuela  trinidad tobago  and ecuador geomarkets 
revenue in the middle east asia area increased by on strong results in the saudi arabia bahrain  australasia  brunei  malaysia philippines  and china geomarkets 
and in north america  revenue grew by billion to reach billion  driven by a robust increase in demand for deepwater and exploration services offshore  particularly in the us gulf of mexico 
revenue from north america land also improved a modest on strong demand for production group technology  although this was tempered by weakness in the hydraulic fracturing market 
all product groups recorded double digit revenue growth 
reservoir characterization revenue of billion increased by  with all technologies also posting double digit growth driven by offshore exploration activity across the areas 
drilling group revenue increased to billion  led by strong growth in m i swaco  drilling measurements  and drilling tools remedial technologies 
production group revenue of billion increased  with double digit growth in well intervention  completions and artificial lift technologies 
well services revenue also increased  primarily from offshore activity 
entering  the world macroeconomic environment remains uncertain with the gdp growth outlook unchanged 
however  global oil demand is expected to grow at similar levels to those seen in and and supply will see further growth in north america as light tight oil production increases 
other non opec production  however  can be expected to continue to face delays and decline challenges 
as a result  global spare capacity should remain largely unchanged absent any unexpected macroeconomic or geopolitical events  and this will support oil prices within the band we have seen since for natural gas  little change is expected in the behavior of the main geographical markets in the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements

charges and credits are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
oilfield services fourth quarter revenue of billion increased million or sequentially  on robust international activity 
of the revenue increase  approximately came from the typical year end surge in product and software sales  and came from the increase in westerngeco multiclient sales 
reservoir characterization group revenue grew to reach billion  while drilling group revenue of billion was higher 
production group revenue increased to billion 
geographically  international revenue of billion increased million or sequentially  while north america revenue of billion grew by million or sequentially 
the sequential increase in reservoir characterization group revenue resulted mainly from robust international end of year schlumberger information solutions sis software sales 
testing services grew for the third successive quarter from higher activity in the saudi arabia bahrain geomarket 
petrotechnical services posted double digit revenue growth on strong consulting activity in the mexico central america geomarket 
westerngeco increased slightly as the end of year multiclient sales and uniq land seismic technology direct sale in russia were partly offset by a sharp seasonal decline in marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following the seasonal transits out of the north sea 
wireline revenue grew from increased activity in the us gulf of mexico but this was largely offset by a seasonal activity decline in asia 
drilling group revenue increased on international and offshore demand for drilling measurements and m i swaco technologies 
drilling tools remedial services also contributed to growth with the full quarter revenue from radius services 
ipm improved slightly as the combination of an increase in projects in australia and new start ups in iraq and argentina was partly offset by project completions in north africa 
the increase in production group revenue resulted primarily from stronger completions and artificial lift product year end sales coupled with new framo subsea projects in the us gulf of mexico and in the north sea and angola geomarkets 
well intervention services revenue also increased on higher activity in the mexico central america and saudi arabia bahrain geomarkets 
well services revenue grew mainly due to higher activity in international and offshore north america markets 
well services stage count in north america land also increased  but revenue declined from continued pricing weakness as a result of hydraulic horsepower oversupply 
among the areas  middle east asia revenue of billion grew sequentially led by the start of new ipm turnkey projects in iraq  higher testing  well intervention and drilling group services in addition to year end product sales in the saudi arabia bahrain geomarket  the start of the jurassic seismic project as well as strong product and year end software sales in kuwait  and the increase in ipm onshore projects and strong drilling activity in the australasia geomarket 
in latin america  revenue of billion increased sequentially led by robust year end software and product sales  strong petrotechnical services consulting activity  unconventional fracturing and well intervention stimulation activity in the mexico central america geomarket 
higher westerngeco vessel utilization for new seismic acquisition surveys in brazil  trinidad and uruguay  coupled with the start of an ipm project in argentina  also contributed to the increase 
in europe cis africa  revenue of billion declined mainly due to lower westerngeco vessel utilization following the seasonal transit of vessels out of the north sea 
completed ipm projects and service contract delays in north africa and the completion of the westerngeco survey in the kara sea in russia also contributed to the decline 
the sequential decrease  however  was partially offset by increased activity in angola and higher product and software sales in the russia and central asia region and the continental europe geomarket 
north america revenue of billion increased sequentially mainly from offshore which rose by  while land fell by 
the increase in offshore revenue resulted from both higher drilling activity as the number of deepwater drilling rigs increased and stronger year end westerngeco multiclient sales 
the decline in land revenue was mainly due to continued pricing weakness for well services hydraulic fracturing activities 
a seasonal decline in deviated and horizontal land drilling activity paired with pricing weakness also affected the drilling group segment in north america 
on a worldwide basis  fourth quarter pretax operating income of billion increased sequentially 
international pretax operating income of billion grew  while north america pretax operating income of million increased 
pretax operating margin of declined basis points bps sequentially 
international pretax operating margin of declined bps  which stemmed from a higher than usual seasonal slowdown and contractual delays in the europe cis africa area that traditionally attract higher margins 
in north america  pretax operating margin of increased bps sequentially due to the increased contribution of high margin offshore services  particularly in the us gulf of mexico  which more than offset margin decline in drilling group and well services activities on land 
by segment  reservoir characterization group pretax operating margin reached while the pretax operating margins of the drilling and production groups were and  respectively 
reservoir characterization group fourth quarter revenue of billion increased million or sequentially 
pretax operating income of million was higher sequentially 
revenue increased mainly through robust international end of year sis software sales while testing services grew for the third successive quarter from higher activity in the saudi arabia bahrain and mexico central america geomarkets 
petrotechnical services revenue also posted double digit growth on strong consulting activity in the mexico central america geomarket 
westerngeco increased slightly as the end of year multiclient sales and uniq land seismic technology direct sale in russia were partly offset by the sharp seasonal decline in marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following seasonal transits out of the north sea 
wireline grew slightly on increased activity in the us gulf of mexico following the recovery from the activity shut down associated with hurricane isaac in the previous quarter  but this was offset by a seasonal activity decline in asia  mainly in the australasia and china geomarkets 
pretax operating margin of increased bps sequentially 
margin expansion was primarily due to traditionally strong end of year sales of schlumberger information services sis software and westerngeco multiclient licenses 
testing services  wireline and petrotechnical services margins also expanded on a more favorable technology mix in exploration and development projects 
these improvements were  however  subdued by lower westerngeco marine margin as a result of lower vessel utilization 
drilling group fourth quarter revenue of billion increased million or sequentially 
pretax operating income of million was lower sequentially 
revenue increased on international and offshore demand for drilling measurements and m i swaco products and services 
drilling tools remedial services activity also contributed to growth with a full quarter of revenue for radius services 
ipm revenue grew slightly  as increased projects in australia and new start ups in iraq and argentina were partly offset by project completions in north africa 
the overall revenue increase was tempered by a decline in drilling related services  mainly in north america land  due to a seasonal decline in deviated and horizontal drilling activity coupled with pricing weakness 
pretax operating margin of decreased bps sequentially 
among the group technologies  sequential margins in drilling measurements and drilling tools remedial services were flat  while margin contractions were recorded at m i swaco and ipm due to geographical mix and operational and start up delays 
production group fourth quarter revenue of billion increased million or sequentially 
pretax operating income of million was higher sequentially 
the increase in revenue resulted primarily from stronger completions and artificial lift product year end sales coupled with new framo subsea projects in the us gulf of mexico and in the north sea and angola geomarkets 
well intervention services revenue increased on higher activity in the mexico central america and saudi arabia bahrain geomarkets 
well services revenue grew mainly due to higher activity in the international and the north america offshore markets 
international activities were strong from stimulation vessel operations in brazil  unconventional fracturing activity in mexico  and new projects in kuwait and iraq 
well services stage count in north america land also grew but land revenue declined on continued pricing weakness from the oversupply of hydraulic horsepower 
pretax operating margin increased bps sequentially to 
the increase was largely attributable to the favorable impact of year end completions and artificial lift product sales coupled with improved profitability from new framo subsea projects 
this margin increase was largely offset by continued well services pricing weakness

oilfield services full year revenue of billion increased versus the same period last year with north america area higher and international activity higher 
internationally  higher exploration and development activities in a number of geomarkets both offshore and in key land markets contributed to the increase 
the increase was led by the europe cis africa area which increased  mainly in russia and in the nigeria gulf of guinea  angola  the east africa and north sea africa geomarkets 
latin america was higher by  mainly in the mexico central america  venezuela  trinidad tobago  and ecuador geomarkets driven by strong integrated project management ipm activity on land and robust offshore activity for wireline and drilling group services and products 
middle east asia increased on strong results in the saudi arabia bahrain  australasia  brunei  malaysia philippines  and china geomarkets 
the increase in north america was due to strong growth in north america offshore driven by robust deepwater and exploration activity that benefited the reservoir characterization and drilling groups technologies 
there was also an improvement in activity in north america land for the production group technologies although the increase slowed in the second half of the year due to the weakness in the hydraulic fracturing market 
full year pretax operating income of billion increased year on year as international pretax operating income of billion increased while north america pretax operating income of billion declined by year on year 
pretax operating margin was essentially flat at as international pretax operating margin expanded bps to while north america pretax operating margin declined bps to 
europe cis africa posted a bps improvement to reach and latin america increased bps to and middle east asia reported a bps increase to 
north america margin decline was due to well services production technologies  as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation 
reservoir characterization group full year revenue of billion was higher than the same period last year led by wireline  testing services  westerngeco and sis technologies driven by improved offshore exploration activities across all areas pretax operating margin increased bps to largely due to the higher margin exploration activities that benefited wireline and testing services  higher sis software sales  higher westerngeco marine vessel utilization and improved uniq land seismic productivity 
drilling group full year revenue of billion was higher than the previous year primarily due to the significantly improved exploration and development activities of m i swaco  drilling measurements  and the other drilling group technologies in north america offshore and in the international markets 
pretax operating margin increased bps to primarily due to the increase in higher margin activities of drilling measurements  m i swaco and drilling tools remedial technologies all of which benefited from exploration activities in north america offshore and in the international markets mainly in the europe cis africa area 
production group full year revenue of billion increased year on year  both in north america and the international markets 
well intervention  artificial lift and completions technologies posted strong growth across all areas 
well services grew both in north america and internationally  with international growth led by latin america and by europe cis africa 
pretax operating margin decreased bps to mainly due to a decline in margins for well services production technologies  primarily in north america  as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation 
this was mitigated by margin expansion for the other production group technologies led by well intervention services and completions

charges and credits are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
oilfield services full year revenue of billion was higher than primarily reflecting the acquisition of smith on august  as well as the significantly improved activity  pricing and asset efficiency for well services technologies in north america as the market transitioned to liquid rich plays demanding increasing service intensity in drilling and completing horizontal wells 
year on year pretax operating margin increased bps to largely due to the improved pricing and asset efficiency for well services technologies in north america and the resumption of higher margin activity in the us gulf of mexico 
however  the margin expansion was tempered by activity disruptions from the geopolitical unrest in north africa and in the middle east during the first quarter of reservoir characterization group full year revenue of billion was higher than the previous year on stronger wireline activity  higher westerngeco marine and multiclient sales  and increased sis software sales 
year on year  pretax operating margin decreased bps to led by margin declines in wireline and testing services  largely due to the revenue mix  as well as the impact of geopolitical events which prevailed during the first quarter of the margin decline however was partially offset by a favorable westerngeco multiclient sales mix and improved marine vessel utilization 
drilling group full year revenue of billion was higher than the previous year reflecting the acquisitions of smith  in august  and geoservices  in april  partially offset by a decrease in ipm activities in mexico 
the ramp up of ipm projects in iraq also contributed to the revenue increase 
year on year  pretax operating margin decreased bps to largely due to the addition of the smith and geoservices activities as well as the effects of the geopolitical events 
production group full year revenue of billion was higher than the previous year while pretax operating margin increased bps to 
well services revenue and margins expanded strongly in north america on higher pricing  capacity additions and improved asset utilization and efficiency as the market transitioned to liquid rich plays 
internationally  well services also posted growth on the strength of higher activity  despite the exceptional geopolitical events that occurred during the first quarter of interest and other income interest and other income consisted of the following stated in millions interest income equity in net earnings of affiliated companies m i swaco others equity income from the m i swaco joint venture in represented eight months of equity income through the closing of the smith transaction 
interest expense interest expense of million in increased by million compared to primarily due to the billion of senior notes due and billion of senior notes due that schlumberger issued during interest expense of million in increased by million compared to primarily due to the billion of long term debt that schlumberger issued during other research engineering and general administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenue  were as follows research engineering general administrative although research engineering decreased as a percentage of revenue in as compared to  it increased in absolute dollars by million 
this increase in absolute dollars was driven in large part by the impact of the smith acquisition 
income taxes the schlumberger effective tax rate was in  in  and in the schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings 
when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america increases  the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease 
conversely  when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of north america decreases  the schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase 
the effective tax rate for both and was impacted by the charges and credits described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the impact of these charges and credits  the effective tax rate in was compared to in this increase in the effective tax rate  excluding the impact of the charges and credits  was primarily attributable to the fact that schlumberger generated a larger proportion of its pretax earnings in north america in as compared to as a result of improved market conditions and the effect of a full year s activity from the acquired smith businesses

this compares to funded at december  schlumberger s international defined benefit pension plans are a combined funded at december  based on the projected benefit obligation 
this compares to funded at december  schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately million to its postretirement benefit plans in  subject to market and business conditions 
there were million outstanding series b debentures at december  during  the remaining million of the series b convertible debentures due june  were converted by holders into million shares of schlumberger common stock and the remaining million of outstanding series b debentures were redeemed for cash 
as of december   schlumberger had approximately billion of cash and short term investments on hand 
schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating billion with commercial banks  of which billion was available and unused as of december  this included billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in the united states and europe 
schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next months 
schlumberger did not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december  summary of major contractual obligations stated in millions payment period contractual obligations total after debt interest on fixed rate debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations excludes future payments for interest 
excludes interest on billion of variable rate debt  which had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business 
although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust its requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods 
refer to note pension and other benefit plans of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
as discussed in note income taxes of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december  is approximately billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit guarantees which relate to business performance bonds  custom excise tax commitments  facility lease rental obligations  etc 
these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of all of schlumberger s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
multiclient seismic data the westerngeco business capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december  and was million and million  respectively 
such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
however  under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year  straight line amortized value 
the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues  which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys 
significant adverse changes in schlumberger s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period 
for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library  future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and non united states 
the united states and non united states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 
certain larger surveys  which are typically prefunded by customers  are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices 
depending on how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill 
the goodwill relating to each of schlumberger s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event  or change in circumstances  indicates an impairment may have occurred 
under generally accepted accounting principles  schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then there is no need to perform any further testing 
however  if schlumberger concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of a two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill  schlumberger s reporting units are its three groups reservoir characterization  drilling and production 
schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test 
based on this assessment  schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount 
accordingly  no further testing was required 
long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value  schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 
income taxes schlumberger conducts business in more than tax jurisdictions  a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving 
schlumberger s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities 
these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or  potentially  through the courts 
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits 
estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances 
however  due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates 
in such an event  schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 
pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates
