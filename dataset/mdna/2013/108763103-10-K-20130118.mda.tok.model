the provision for taxes on income of consists of minimum federal and state income taxes 
in fiscal year  the effective income tax rate differed from the applicable mixed statutory rate of approximately primarily due to recording a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
the benefit on taxes on income of consists of minimum federal and state income taxes 
the company policy outlines measurable objective criteria that must be met before a release of the valuation allowance will occur 
the three criteria set forth in the policy must all be satisfied before the valuation allowance can be reversed 
the criteria are as follows first  the company s available federal tax net operating loss nol must be zero  second  the prior thirty six month cumulative book basis pre tax income loss  after considering one time events  is positive  third  the company considers its outlook of near term continued profitable operations and assesses any material negative and positive trends or events on the immediate horizon 
as of november   the company has a federal tax nol of  has positive thirty six month cumulative book income and severe drought is predicted to lead to increased prices for food and ultimately beef and other commodities according to the united states department of agriculture 
only the second criteria has been satisfied  therefore  the company will maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of november  due to the degree of judgment involved  actual taxable income could differ materially from management estimates  or the timing of taxable income could be such that the net operating losses could expire prior to their utilization 
management could determine in the future that the assets are realizable  materially increasing net income in one or many periods 
following recognition  management could reinstate a full valuation allowance should operating performance decline 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands except share amounts the principal source of our operating cash flow is cash receipts from the sale of our products  net of costs to manufacture  store  market and deliver to customers 
we have remained free of bank debt for the past twenty six years and we fund our operations from cash balances and cash flow generated from operations 
we normally expect positive operating cash flows in the first quarter of our fiscal year from the liquidation of inventory and accounts receivable balances related to holiday season sales 
we typically build inventories in the third quarter for anticipated holiday season sales that occur in the fourth and first quarters 
anticipated commodity price trends may also affect cash balances 
certain commodities may be purchased in advance of our immediate needs to lower the ultimate cost of processing

inventory was higher than normal due to the development of a unique product line and finished goods inventory build up related to the holiday selling season 
during fiscal year we funded  towards our defined benefit pension plan 
plan funding strategies may be adjusted depending upon economic conditions  investment options  tax deductibility  or recent legislative changes in funding requirements 
our cash conversion cycle defined as days of inventory and trade receivables less days of trade payables outstanding is relatively quick  and was equal to days for the fifty three weeks ended november  and days for the fifty two weeks ended october  compared with the prior year  the favorable impact on the cash conversion cycle resulted from lower days of inventory  primarily due to higher sales in for the fifty two weeks ended october   sources of cash include a significant refund on the prior year s tax overpayment 
operating cash flows were reduced by an increase in accounts receivable of  an increase in inventory of  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of and a decrease in non current liabilities of  during fiscal year  we funded  towards our defined benefit pension plan 
cash used in investing activities weeks weeks proceeds from sale of property  plant and equipment additions to property  plant and equipment net cash used in investing activities expenditures for property  plant and equipment include the acquisition of new equipment  upgrading of facilities to maintain operating efficiency and investments in cost effective technologies to lower costs 
in general  we capitalize the cost of additions and improvements and expense the cost for repairs and maintenance 
the company may also capitalize costs related to improvements that extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the efficiency of existing machinery and equipment 
specifically  capitalization of upgrades of facilities to maintain operating efficiency include acquisitions of machinery and equipment used on packaging lines and refrigeration equipment used to process food products 
the table below highlights the additions to property  plant and equipment for the fifty three weeks and fifty two weeks ended respectively november  weeks october  weeks temperature control processing equipment packaging lines office and building improvements delivery vehicles computer software and hardware quality control decrease in projects in process additions to property  plant and equipment the capital expenditures below represent the amount of property  plant and equipment acquired under a capital lease arrangement 
these acquisitions are not reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows since they were acquired through capital lease obligations 
november  october  transportation equipment financed by capital lease obligations cash used in financing activities weeks weeks shares repurchased payments of capital lease obligations dividends paid net cash used in financing activities our stock repurchase program was approved by the board of directors in november and was expanded in june under the stock repurchase program  we are authorized  at the discretion of management and the board of directors  to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock on the open market 
as of the end of fiscal year   shares were still authorized for repurchase under the program 
a one time cash dividend of five cents per share of common stock was approved on november  to shareholders of record on november   payable on december  a one time cash dividend was paid in the amount of ten cents per share during the first twelve weeks of the fiscal year 
we invested in transportation equipment during fiscal financed by a capital lease obligation in the amount of  the term of the lease is six years 
the total capital lease obligation remaining as of november  is  the capital lease arrangement replaces the long standing month to month leases of transportation equipment 
we maintain a line of credit with wells fargo bank  na that expires on march  under the terms of this line of credit  we may borrow up to  at an interest rate equal to the bank s reference rate  unless we elect an optional interest rate 
the borrowing agreement contains various covenants  the more significant of which require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and a quick ratio not less than to and a minimum net income after tax 
the company was in violation of the tangible net worth and net income covenants which were subsequently waived per letter dated january  
there were no borrowings under this line of credit during the year 
impact of inflation our operating results are heavily dependent upon the prices paid for raw materials 
the marketing of our value added products does not lend itself to instantaneous changes in selling prices 
changes in selling prices are relatively infrequent and do not compare with the volatility of commodity markets 
while fluctuations in significant cost structure components  such as ingredient commodities and fuel prices  have had a significant impact on profitability over the last two fiscal years  the impact of general price inflation on our financial position and results of operations has not been significant 
however  future volatility of general price inflation or deflation and raw material cost and availability could adversely affect our financial results 
the impact of inflation on the company s financial position and results of operations has not been significant 
management is of the opinion that the company s strong financial position and its capital resources are sufficient to provide for its operating needs and capital expenditures for fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
contractual obligations we have remained free of interest bearing debt excluding capital leases for twenty six consecutive years and had no other debt or other contractual obligations at november  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
amounts estimated related to liabilities for self insured workers compensation  employee healthcare and pension benefits are especially subject to inherent uncertainties and these estimated liabilities may ultimately settle at amounts not originally estimated 
we record promotional and returns allowances and bad debt and inventory allowances based on recent and historical trends 
management believes its current estimates are reasonable and based on the best information available at the time 
disclosure concerning our policies on credit risk  revenue recognition  cash surrender or contract value for life insurance policies  deferred income tax and the recoverability of our long lived assets are provided in notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements and regulations various accounting standard setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements  interpretations and exposure drafts
