overview fsp corp  or we  operate in the real estate operations segment 
the real estate operations segment involves real estate rental operations  leasing  secured financing of real estate and services provided for asset management  property management  property acquisitions  dispositions and development 
the main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the united states 
these market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level 
we have no influence on broader economic market conditions 
we look to acquire and or develop quality properties in good locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur 
trends and uncertainties economic conditions the economy in the united states is continuing to experience a period of limited economic growth  including high levels of unemployment  which directly affects the demand for office space  our primary income producing asset 
the broad economic market conditions in the united states are affected by numerous factors  including but not limited to  inflation and employment levels  energy prices  slow economic growth and or recessionary concerns  uncertainty about government fiscal and tax policy  changes in currency exchange rates  geopolitical events  the regulatory environment  the availability of debt and interest rate fluctuations 
we believe that recent economic conditions in the united states have negatively affected our business by  among other factors  contributing to a decline in occupancy and rental rates in our real estate portfolio in and although occupancy levels in our real estate portfolio improved in and  future economic factors may negatively affect real estate values  occupancy levels and property income 
at this time  we cannot predict the extent or duration of any negative impact that the current state of the united states economy will have on our business 
real estate operations leasing our real estate portfolio was approximately leased as of december  and approximately leased as of december  during the year ended december   we leased approximately  square feet of office space  of which approximately  square feet were with existing tenants  at a weighted average term of years 
on average  tenant improvements for such leases were per square foot  lease commissions were per square foot and rent concessions were approximately three months of free rent 

table of contents gaap base rents under such leases were per square foot  or higher than average rents in the respective properties as applicable compared to the prior period 
as of december   approximately of the square footage in our portfolio is scheduled to expire during  and approximately is scheduled to expire during our property portfolio is primarily suburban office assets 
most of the rental leasing markets where our properties are located remained stable during the fourth quarter both in terms of occupancy and rental rate levels 
within this environment  we made steady leasing progress that helped us achieve higher year end occupancy 
our property portfolio has relatively modest lease expirations over the next two years and  along with the improvement in our occupancy levels  should allow overall tenant improvement expenditures and leasing costs to moderate in relation to the level of rental revenues being achieved 
while we cannot generally predict when existing vacancy in our real estate portfolio will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be  we expect to renew or sign new leases at then current market rates for locations in which the buildings are located  which in many cases may be below the expiring rates 
also  even as the economy recovers  we believe the potential for any of our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy still exists 
if any of our tenants defaults on its lease  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
in addition  at any time  a tenant of one of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws  which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders real estate acquisition and investment activity during  we acquired two properties directly into our portfolio with a total of approximately  rentable square feet at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
on july   we acquired an office property with approximately  square feet for approximately million in atlanta  georgia and on november  we acquired an office property with approximately  square feet for approximately million in houston  texas 
funded advances on sponsored reit loans for revolving lines of credit of an aggregate of approximately million including million during march to fsp south tenth street corp  and million for revolving lines of credit made during the year ended december   received repayments on sponsored reit loans of million  including million on july  from a first mortgage loan on a property owned by fsp south tenth street corp  and million on december  from a secured revolving line of credit with fsp phoenix tower corp  made and funded a sponsored reit loan on july   in the form of a first mortgage loan in the principal amount of million to a wholly owned subsidiary of a sponsored reit  fsp energy tower i corp  which owns a property in houston  texas 
during  we we acquired five properties directly into our portfolio with an aggregate of approximately  rentable square feet at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
on march  we acquired a commercial property with approximately  rentable square feet for approximately million in north carolina  on march   we acquired a commercial property with approximately  rentable square feet for approximately million in texas  on march   we acquired another commercial property with approximately  rentable square feet for approximately million in texas  on september  we acquired a property with approximately  rentable square feet for approximately million in illinois and on october  we acquired another commercial property with approximately  rentable square feet for approximately million in texas  and funded advances on sponsored reit loans of an aggregate of approximately million including million on december   for a first mortgage loan on a property owned by fsp south tenth street corp  which was repaid in and million for revolving lines of credit and construction loans made during the year ended december  
table of contents during  we acquired a commercial property on june   with approximately  rentable square feet for approximately million in minneapolis  minnesota  and funded advances on sponsored reit loans for revolving lines of credit and a construction loan of an aggregate of approximately million 
discontinued operations and dispositions we include properties sold or held for sale and investment banking activities as discontinued operations 
property dispositions during the three months ended september   we reached a decision to classify our office property located in southfield  michigan as an asset held for sale 
in evaluating the southfield  michigan property  management considered various subjective factors  including the time  cost and likelihood of successfully leasing the property  the effect of the property s results on its unencumbered asset value  which is part of the leverage ratio used to calculate interest rates under the credit facility and future capital costs to upgrade and reposition the multi tenant property and to lease up the building  recent leasing and economic activity in the local area  and offers to purchase the property 
we concluded that selling the property was the more prudent decision and outweighed the potential future benefit of continuing to hold the property 
the property was expected to sell within one year at a loss  which was recorded as a provision for loss on a property held for sale of million net of applicable income taxes and was classified as an asset held for sale of million at september  we sold the property on december  for million resulting in a total loss of million 
we sold an industrial property located in savage  maryland on june  at a million gain and in reached an agreement to sell an office property  located in falls church  virginia  which was sold on january  at a million gain 
the falls church  virginia property was classified as an asset held for sale at december  accordingly  properties sold were classified as discontinued for all periods presented 
we will continue to evaluate our portfolio  and in the future may decide to dispose of additional properties from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that the current property sales environment remains challenged in many markets relative to both liquidity and pricing 
however  we also believe that we are witnessing improving pricing and liquidity in certain markets  extending a trend that we believe began in the second half of we believe that both improving office property fundamentals as well as plentiful and attractive financing availability will likely be required to broadly improve the marketplace for property dispositions 
as an important part of our total return strategy  we intend to be active in property dispositions when we believe that market conditions warrant such activity and  as a consequence  we continuously review and evaluate our portfolio of properties for potentially advantageous dispositions and would anticipate one or more potential dispositions during investment banking previously we operated in the investment banking segment  and in december  we discontinued those activities 
the investment banking segment involved the structuring of real estate investments and broker dealer services that included the organization of sponsored reits  the acquisition and development of real estate on behalf of sponsored reits and the raising of capital to equitize the sponsored reits through sale of preferred stock in 
table of contents private placements 
on december   we announced that our broker dealer subsidiary  fsp investments llc  would no longer sponsor the syndication of shares of preferred stock in newly formed sponsored reits 
fsp investments llc continues to provide investor services to existing sponsored reits  which is not a significant activity  and has the capability to sponsor the syndication of any additional shares of preferred stock in existing sponsored reits 
our decision to no longer sponsor the syndication of shares of preferred stock in newly formed sponsored reits was made after judging the potential for meaningful future profit contribution to our earnings from such syndications to be limited 
our investment banking segment had been marginal in its profit contribution over the last four years and we believed time and resources would be more productively deployed elsewhere critical accounting policies we have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations  and that require significant management estimates and judgments  are discussed below 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  purchase price allocations  useful lives of fixed assets  impairment considerations and the valuation of the derivative 
critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in sponsored reits and our investments in real property 
these policies affect our allocation of purchase prices  allowance for doubtful accounts  assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets  useful lives of fixed assets and intangibles  valuation of derivatives  and classification of leases 
these policies involve significant judgments made based upon our experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability of our tenants to perform their obligations to us  current and future economic conditions and competitive factors in the markets in which our properties are located 
competition  economic conditions and other factors may cause occupancy declines in the future 
in the future we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
allocation of purchase price we have historically allocated the purchase prices of properties to land  buildings and improvements 
each component of purchase price generally has a different useful life 
for properties acquired subsequent to june   we allocate the value of real estate acquired among land  buildings  improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities  which may consist of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  and the value of tenant relationships 
purchase price allocations and the determination of the useful lives are based on management s estimates 
under some circumstances we may rely upon studies commissioned from independent real estate appraisal firms in determining the purchase price allocations 
purchase price allocated to land and building and improvements is based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets assuming the property was vacant 
management determines the fair value of a 
table of contents property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
purchase price allocated to above or below market leases is based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases including consideration of potential lease renewals and ii our estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
purchase price allocated to in place leases and tenant relationships is determined as the excess of i the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in place leases to market rental rates over ii the estimated fair value of the property as if vacant 
this aggregate value is allocated between in place lease values and tenant relationships based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease  however  the value of tenant relationships has not been separated from in place lease value because such value and its consequence to amortization expense is immaterial for acquisitions reflected in our financial statements 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include i an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  including real estate taxes  insurance and other operating income and expenses  and ii costs to execute similar leases in current market conditions  such as leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
if future acquisitions result in our allocating material amounts to the value of tenant relationships  those amounts would be separately allocated and amortized over the estimated life of the relationships 
allowance for bad debts we provide an allowance for bad debts based on our estimate of a tenant s ability to make future rent payments 
the computation of this allowance is based in part on the tenants payment history and current credit status 
impairment we periodically evaluate our real estate properties for impairment indicators 
these indicators may include declining tenant occupancy  weak or declining tenant profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or legislative  economic or market changes that permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the property by comparing it to its expected future undiscounted cash flows 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to the present value of these expected future cash flows 
this analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future tenant profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate or fail to record a charge when we should have done so  or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
depreciation and amortization expense we compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
costs incurred in connection with leasing primarily tenant improvements and leasing commissions are capitalized and amortized over the lease period 
the allocated cost of land is not depreciated 
the value of above or below market leases is amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases as an adjustment to rental income 
the value of in place leases  exclusive of the value of above market and below market in place leases  is also amortized over the remaining non cancelable periods of the respective leases 
if a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration  all unamortized amounts relating to that lease are written off 
inappropriate allocation of acquisition costs  or incorrect estimates of useful lives  could result in depreciation and amortization expenses which do not appropriately reflect the allocation of our capital expenditures over future periods  as is required by generally accepted accounting principles 
derivative instruments we recognize derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that do not qualify  or are not designated as hedge relationships  must be adjusted to fair value through income 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
to the extent hedges are effective  a corresponding amount  adjusted for swap payments  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
amounts are then reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the income 
table of contents statement in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
ineffectiveness  if any  is recorded in the income statement 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
we currently have no fair value hedges outstanding 
fair values of derivatives are subject to significant variability based on changes in interest rates 
to the extent we enter into fair value hedges in the future  the results of such variability could be a significant increase or decrease in our derivative assets  derivative liabilities  book equity  and or earnings 
lease classification some of our real estate properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate whether it is appropriately classified as a capital lease or as an operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a property  discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
ownership of stock in a sponsored reit and related interests common stock investments in sponsored reits were consolidated while the entity was controlled by the company 
following the commencement of syndication the company exercised influence over  but did not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
once under the equity method of accounting  our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses or dividends received from sponsored reits generally are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there is an asset held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
in december  we announced that we will no longer sponsor the syndication of newly formed sponsored reits 
we recognized our share of the operations during the period we consolidated and when the equity method is appropriate  as opposed to classifying the sponsored reits as discontinued operations  because we earned an ongoing asset and or property management fee from sponsored reits 
these ongoing fees  in addition to the influence that we exercise over the sponsored reit  constituted a continuing involvement between the company and the sponsored reit and precluded treatment as discontinued operations 
we currently hold preferred stock interests in two sponsored reits 
as a result of our common and preferred stock interests in these two sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities 
these preferred stock interests are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits operations and distributions received 
we also agreed to vote our preferred shares i with respect to any merger in the same manner that a majority of the other stockholders of the sponsored reit vote for or against the merger and ii with respect to any other matter presented to a vote by the stockholders of these sponsored reits in the same proportion as shares voted by other stockholders of that sponsored reit 
we also previously held a preferred stock interest in a third sponsored reit known as phoenix tower 
on december   the property owned by phoenix tower was sold and  thereafter  phoenix tower declared and issued a liquidating distribution for its preferred shareholders  from which the company was entitled to  as a result of the sale  the company recognized its share of the gain of  as of december   we held a beneficial interest in the phoenix tower liquidating trust in the amount of  of which  was received on january  
table of contents results of operations impact of real estate acquisition and investment activity the results of operations for each of the acquired properties are included in our operating results as of their respective purchase dates and the funding and repayment dates for mortgage investments 
increases in rental revenues  interest income from loans and expenses for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   or the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  are primarily a result of the timing of these acquisitions and subsequent contribution of these acquired properties as well as the affect on interest income from the dates of funding and repayment on our mortgage investments

table of contents comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues total revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of an increase in rental revenue of approximately million arising primarily from the acquisition of one property in july  another property in november  another property in october  another property in september and three properties in march that were included in the results for the year ended december   and leasing  which raised occupancy to at december  compared to at december  a million increase in management fee income from sponsored reits we managed during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of syndications started during a million increase in interest income from sponsored reit loans  which was principally a result of a larger loan receivable balance  from which interest income is derived  and a higher interest rate charged during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  expenses total expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of an increase in real estate operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance of approximately million  and depreciation of million  which were primarily from the acquisition of one property in july  another property in november  another property in october  another property in september and three properties in march an increase to interest expense of approximately million to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was attributable to a higher amount of debt outstanding  and to a lesser extent the acceleration of some amortization of deferred financing costs related to the credit facility 
an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   which was primarily the result of a million increase in compensation accruals during the year ended december  compared to the same period in and a realignment of personnel and resources in our real estate business following a decision to discontinue our investment banking activities in december these increases were partially offset by lower acquisition costs of million related to the acquisition of properties during the year ended december  compared to million related to acquisition of properties during the year ended december  we had and employees as of december  and  respectively  at our headquarters in wakefield  massachusetts 
equity in earnings of non consolidated reits equity in earnings from non consolidated reits decreased approximately million to million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million from syndications that we had in from investment banking  which was discontinued in december we also had a decrease of million in equity in income from our preferred stock investment in sponsored reit  fsp east wacker drive corp  which we refer to as east wacker  during the year ended december  compared to the same period in these decreases were partially offset by a million gain included in equity in income from our preferred stock investment in phoenix tower  which sold its property on december

table of contents non gaap financial measures funds from operations the company evaluates performance based on funds from operations  which we refer to as ffo  as management believes that ffo represents the most accurate measure of activity and is the basis for distributions paid to equity holders 
the company defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and acquisition costs of newly acquired properties that are not capitalized  plus depreciation and amortization  including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges  and after adjustments to exclude non cash income or losses from non consolidated or sponsored reits  plus distributions received from non consolidated or sponsored reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  nor as an indicator of the company s financial performance  nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  nor as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs 
other real estate companies and the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  may define this term in a different manner 
we have included the nareit ffo definition in our table and note that other reits may not define ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the results of the company  ffo should be examined in connection with net income and cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements the calculations of ffo are shown in the following table for the year ended december  in thousands net income loss gain loss on sale  less applicable income tax equity in earnings of non consolidated reits distribution from non consolidated reits depreciation and amortization nareit ffo acquisition costs of new properties funds from operations net operating income noi the company provides property performance based on net operating income  which we refer to as noi

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
this decrease of million is attributable to million provided by operating activities less million used by investing activities plus million provided by financing activities 
management believes that existing cash  cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations and our existing debt financing will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next months 
although there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary for our future growth  we anticipate generating funds from continuing real estate operations 
we believe that we have adequate funds to cover unusual expenses and capital improvements  in addition to normal operating expenses 
our ability to maintain or increase our level of dividends to stockholders  however  depends in significant part upon the level of rental income from our real properties

we were in compliance with the credit facility financial covenants as of december  we may use the proceeds of the loans under the credit agreement to finance the acquisition of real properties and for other permitted investments  to finance investments associated with sponsored reits  to refinance or retire existing indebtedness and for working capital and other general business purposes  in each case to the extent permitted under the credit agreement equity securities on may   we entered into an on demand offering sales agreement that allows us to offer and sell up to an aggregate gross sales price of million of our common stock from time to time  which we refer to as our atm sales program 
the on demand offering sales agreement for the atm sales program was amended on april  in connection with our filing of a new registration statement on form s sales of shares of our common stock depend upon market conditions and other factors determined by us and are deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in rule of the securities act of  as amended  including sales made directly on the nyse mkt or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange  as well as in negotiated transactions  if and to the extent agreed by us in writing 
we have no obligation to sell any shares of our common stock  and may at any time suspend solicitation and offers 
during the year ended december   we did not sell any shares of our common stock under our atm sales program 
as of december   we were authorized to offer and sell a remainder of approximately million of our shares of common stock under the atm sales program 
as of december   we had an automatic shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission relating to the offer and sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of our common stock 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional shares of our common stock under our automatic shelf registration statement or a different registration statement to fund the acquisition of additional properties  to pay down any existing debt financing and for other corporate purposes 
contingencies from time to time we may make secured loans to sponsored reits in the form of mortgage loans or revolving line of credit to fund construction costs  capital expenditures  leasing costs and for other purposes 
as of december   we were committed to fund up to million to seven sponsored reits under such arrangements  of which million in the aggregate has been drawn and is outstanding 
we anticipate that advances made under these facilities will be repaid at their maturity date or earlier from long term financings of the underlying properties  cash flows from the underlying properties or another other capital event 
we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur  we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
related party transactions in march  we commenced the syndication of fsp union centre corp  which was fully subscribed on december  in november  we commenced the syndication of fsp monument circle corp  which was fully subscribed on march  we intend to draw on the credit facility in the future for a variety of corporate purposes  including the acquisition of properties that we acquire directly for our portfolio and for sponsored reit loans as described below 

table of contents loans to sponsored reits sponsored reit loans from time to time we may make secured loans sponsored reit loans to sponsored reits in the form of mortgage loans or revolving lines of credit to fund construction costs  capital expenditures  leasing costs and for other purposes 
we anticipate that each sponsored reit loan will be repaid at maturity or earlier from long term financings of the underlying properties  cash flows from the underlying properties or some other capital event 
each sponsored reit loan is secured by a mortgage on the underlying property and has a term of approximately two to three years 
except for the mortgage loan with a revolving line of credit component which bore interest at a fixed rate and was repaid in july and a mortgage loan which also bears interest at a fixed rate  advances under each sponsored reit loan bear interest at a rate equal to the day libor rate plus an agreed upon amount of basis points and most advances also require a basis point draw fee 
in december  the company received a loan fee of  at the time of the closing of the mortgage loan with a revolving line of credit component 
in march  a  fee was collected in connection with a million draw from the revolving line of credit component 
that loan was repaid in full during july and also included a fee collected of  in july  the company received a loan fee of  at the time of the closing of the mortgage loan and a fee will be collected on all amounts repaid under the loan 
our sponsored reit loans subject us to credit risk 
however  we believe that our position as asset manager of each of the sponsored reits helps mitigate that risk by providing us with unique insight and the ability to rely on qualitative analysis of the sponsored reits 
before making a sponsored reit loan  we consider a variety of subjective factors  including the quality of the underlying real estate  leasing  the financial condition of the applicable sponsored reit and local and national market conditions 
these factors are subject to change and we do not apply a formula or assign relative weights to the factors 
instead  we make a subjective determination after considering such factors collectively 
acquisition loans prior to terminating the activities of our investment banking segment in december  we typically made an acquisition loan to each sponsored reit which was secured by a mortgage on the borrower s real estate 
these loans enabled sponsored reits to acquire their respective properties prior to the consummation of the offerings of their equity interests 
we refer to these loans as acquisition loans 
we anticipated that each acquisition loan would be repaid at maturity or earlier from the proceeds of the sponsored reit s equity offering 
each acquisition loan had an original term of two years and bore interest at approximately the same rate paid by fsp corp 
for borrowings under our previous revolving lines of credit  as applicable 
we made one acquisition loan for the syndication of fsp union centre corp 
during  which was repaid on october  there were no acquisition loans outstanding at december  and acquisition loans are classified as assets held for syndication

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements investments in sponsored reits previously we operated in the investment banking segment  and in december  we discontinued those activities 
the investment banking segment involved the structuring of real estate investments and broker dealer services that included the organization of sponsored reits  the acquisition and development of real estate on behalf of sponsored reits and the raising of capital to equitize the sponsored reits through sale of preferred stock in private placements 
on december   we announced that our broker dealer subsidiary  fsp investments llc  would no longer sponsor the syndication of shares of preferred stock in newly formed sponsored reits 
the sponsored reits own real estate  purchases of which were financed through the private placement of equity in those entities  typically through syndication 
these sponsored reits are operated in a manner intended to qualify as real estate investment trusts 
we earned fees related to the sale of preferred stock in the sponsored reits in these syndications 
the sponsored reits issued both common stock and preferred stock 
the common stock is owned by fsp corp 
generally the preferred stock is owned by unaffiliated investors  however  we acquired an interest in preferred shares of five sponsored reits 
in addition  directors and officers of fsp corp  have from time to time invested in sponsored reits 
following consummation of the offerings  the preferred stockholders in each of the sponsored reits were entitled to of the sponsored reit s cash distributions 
subsequent to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  except for the preferred stock we own  we do not share in any of the sponsored reit s earnings  or any related dividend  and the common stock ownership interests have virtually no economic benefit or risk 
prior to the completion of the offering of preferred shares  we shared in sponsored reit s earnings and related dividends to the extent of our ownership interest in the sponsored reit 
as a common stockholder  upon completion of the syndication  we have no rights to the sponsored reit s earnings or any related cash distributions 
however  upon liquidation of a sponsored reit  we are entitled to our percentage interest as a common stockholder in any proceeds remaining after the preferred stockholders have recovered their investment 
our common stock percentage interest in each sponsored reit is less than

in addition  all of the sponsored reits allow the holders of more than of the outstanding preferred shares to remove without cause and replace one or more members of that sponsored reit s board of directors 
common stock investments in sponsored reits are consolidated while the entity is controlled by us 
following the commencement of syndication we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities and investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting  the cost basis is increased by its share of the sponsored reits earnings  if any  prior to completion of the syndication 
equity in losses of sponsored reits was not recognized to the extent that the investment balance would become negative and distributions received are recognized as income once the investment balance is reduced to zero  unless there are assets held for syndication from the sponsored reit entity 
equity in losses or distributions received in excess of investment is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for syndication 
in december  the company discontinued sydicating newly formed sponsored reits and had no acquisition loans outstanding at december  we have acquired a preferred stock interest in five sponsored reits  including one that sold the property owned by it on december  and made a liquidating distribution to us  one we acquired on may  by cash merger and another we acquired on april  by merger 
as a result of our common stock interest and our preferred stock interest in the remaining two sponsored reits  we exercise influence over  but do not control these entities 
these preferred share investments are accounted for using the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting our cost basis is adjusted by our share of the sponsored reits operations and distributions received

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate borrowing arrangements 
we use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december  and december   if market rates on our outstanding borrowings under our revolver and the revolver  respectively  increased by at maturity  or approximately and basis points  respectively  over the current variable rate  the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by million and million annually 
based upon our leverage ratio  the interest rate on our borrowings on the revolver as of december  was libor plus basis points  or per annum 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by borrowings under our revolver is material as of december  although the interest rate on the credit facility is variable  the company fixed the base libor interest rate on the term loan by entering into an interest rate swap agreement 
on september   the company entered into an isda master agreement with bank of america  na that fixed the base libor interest rate on the term loan at per annum for five years 
accordingly  based upon the company s leverage ratio  as of december   the interest rate on the term loan was per annum 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is affected by changes in market interest rates 
we believe that we have mitigated interest rate risk with respect to the term loan through the interest rate swap agreement for the five year term of the term loan 
this interest rate swap agreement was our only derivative instrument as of december  
table of contents the table below lists our derivative instrument  which is hedging variable cash flows related to interest on our term loan as of december  in thousands notional strike effective expiration fair value rate date date value interest rate swap sep sep our term loan hedging transaction used a derivative instrument that involves certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
we require our derivatives contracts to be with counterparties that have an investment grade rating 
the counterparty to our derivative arrangement is bank of america  na  which has an investment grade rating 
as a result  we do not anticipate that the counterparty will fail to meet its obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks or that we will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
the revolver has a term of four years and matures on september  we have the right to extend the initial maturity date of the revolver by an additional months  or until september   upon payment of a fee and satisfaction of certain customary conditions 
the revolver includes an accordion feature that allows for up to  of additional borrowing capacity subject to receipt of lender commitments and satisfaction of certain customary conditions 
upon maturity  our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments will be dependent upon the balance then outstanding and prevalent market interest rates 
we borrow from time to time under the revolver 
these borrowings bear interest at either i a rate equal to libor plus to basis points depending on our total leverage ratio at the time of the borrowing libor plus basis points  or at december  or ii a rate equal to the bank s base rate plus to basis points depending on our total leverage ratio at the time of the borrowing the bank s base rate plus basis points  or at december  
there were borrowings totaling million on the revolver and million on the revolver  at a weighted average rate of and outstanding at december  and december   respectively
