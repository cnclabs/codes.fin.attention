item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and overview as of december   we manage our portfolio within seven segments pennsylvania suburbs  philadelphia cbd  metropolitan washington dc  new jersey delaware  richmond  virginia  austin  texas and california 
the pennsylvania suburbs segment includes properties in chester  delaware  and montgomery counties in the philadelphia suburbs 
the philadelphia cbd segment includes properties located in the city of philadelphia in pennsylvania 
the metropolitan washington  dc segment includes properties in northern virginia and suburban maryland 
the new jersey delaware segment includes properties in burlington  camden and mercer counties in new jersey and in new castle county in the state of delaware 
the richmond  virginia segment includes properties primarily in albemarle  chesterfield  goochland and henrico counties and 
table of contents durham  north carolina 
the austin  texas segment includes properties in austin 
the california segment includes properties in oakland  concord  carlsbad and rancho bernardo 
we generate cash and revenue from leases of space at our properties and  to a lesser extent  from the management of properties owned by third parties and from investments in the real estate ventures 
factors that we evaluate when leasing space include rental rates  costs of tenant improvements  tenant creditworthiness  current and expected operating costs  the length of the lease  vacancy levels and demand for office and industrial space 
we also generate cash through sales of assets  including assets that we do not view as core to our portfolio  either because of location or expected growth potential  and assets that are commanding premium prices from third party investors 
factors that may influence future results of operations global market and economic conditions in the us  market and economic conditions have been challenging  characterized by tight credit conditions and modest growth 
while recent economic data reflects modest growth  the cost and availability of credit may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued volatility in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability and the ability of our tenants  to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
real estate asset valuation general economic conditions and the resulting impact on market conditions or a downturn in tenants businesses may adversely affect the value of our assets 
challenging economic conditions in the us  declining demand for leased office  mixed use  or industrial properties and or a decrease in market rental rates and or market values of real estate assets in our submarkets could have a negative impact on the value of our properties and related tenant improvements 
if we were required under gaap to write down the carrying value of any of our properties to the lower of cost or fair value due to impairment  or if as a result of an early lease termination we were required to remove or dispose of material amounts of tenant improvements that are not reusable to another tenant  our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected 
leasing activity and rental rates the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space  newly developed or redeveloped properties and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in our submarkets 
negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods 
development and redevelopment programs historically  a significant portion of our growth has come from our development and redevelopment efforts 
we have a proactive planning process by which we continually evaluate the size  timing  costs and scope of our development and redevelopment programs and  as necessary  scale activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our strategic submarkets 
we are currently proceeding on certain redevelopment projects  and we take a cautious and selective approach when determining if a certain development or redevelopment project will benefit our portfolio 
in addition  we may be unable to lease committed development or redevelopment properties at expected rental rates or within projected timeframes or complete development or redevelopment properties on schedule or within budgeted amounts  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
financial and operating performance our financial and operating performance is dependent upon the demand for office  industrial and other commercial space in our markets  our leasing results  our acquisition  disposition and development activity  our financing activity  our cash requirements and economic and market conditions  including prevailing interest rates 
volatile economic conditions could result in a reduction of the availability of financing and potentially in higher borrowing costs 
these factors  coupled with an ongoing economic recovery  have reduced the volume of real estate transactions and created credit 
table of contents stresses on some businesses 
vacancy rates may increase  and rental rates may decline  through and possibly beyond as the current economic climate may negatively impacts tenants 
we expect that the impact of the current state of the economy  including high unemployment and potential volatility in the financial and credit markets  could have a dampening effect on the fundamentals of our business  including increases in past due accounts  tenant defaults  lower occupancy and reduced effective rents 
these conditions would negatively affect our future net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we believe that the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet will enable us to raise debt capital  if necessary  in various forms and from different sources  including traditional term or secured loans from banks  pension funds and life insurance companies 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow funds on terms that are economically attractive or at all 
we seek revenue growth throughout our portfolio by increasing occupancy and rental rates 
occupancy at our wholly owned properties at december  was 
the table below summarizes selected operating and leasing statistics of our wholly owned operating properties for the year ended december  year ended december  leasing activity total net rentable square feet owned occupancy percentage end of period average occupancy percentage new leases and expansions commenced square feet leases renewed square feet net absorption square feet percentage change in rental rates per square feet new and expansion rental rates renewal rental rates combined rental rates capital costs committed leasing commissions per square feet tenant improvements per square feet for each period  includes all properties in the core portfolio ie not under development or redevelopment  including properties that were sold during these periods 
includes leasing related to completed developments and redevelopments  as well as sold properties 
rental rates include base rent plus reimbursement for operating expenses and real estate taxes 
calculated on an average basis 
in seeking to increase revenue through our operating  financing and investment activities  we also seek to minimize operating risks  including i tenant rollover risk  ii tenant credit risk and iii development risk 
tenant rollover risk we are subject to the risks that tenant leases  upon expiration  are not renewed  that space may not be relet  and that the terms of renewal or reletting including the cost of renovations may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms 
leases accounting for approximately of our aggregate final annualized base rents as of december  representing approximately of the net rentable square feet of the properties expire without penalty in we maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to maximize lease renewals 
our retention rate for leases that were scheduled to expire in was 
if we are unable to renew leases or relet space under expiring leases  at anticipated rental rates  or if tenants terminate their leases early  our cash flow would be adversely impacted 

table of contents tenant credit risk in the event of a tenant default  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
our management regularly evaluates our accounts receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions 
our accounts receivable allowance was million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  compared to million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  if economic conditions persist or deteriorate further  we may experience increases in past due accounts  defaults  lower occupancy and reduced effective rents 
this condition would negatively affect our future net income and cash flows and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
development risk as of december   we owned approximately acres of undeveloped land  and held options to purchase approximately additional acres of undeveloped land 
as market conditions warrant  we will seek to opportunistically monetize those parcels through sale or development 
for parcels of land that we ultimately develop  we will be subject to risks and costs associated with land development  including building moratoriums and inability to obtain necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental approvals  construction cost increases or overruns and construction delays  and insufficient occupancy rates and rental rates 
we also entered into development agreements related to two parcels of land under option for ground lease that required us to commence development by december  during the current year  we were granted an extension to commence development by december  related to these development agreements  and will incur a million extension fee over the extension period 
if we determine that we will not be able to start the construction by the date specified  or if we determine that development is not in our best economic interest and an additional extension of the development period cannot be negotiated  we will have to write off all costs that we have incurred in preparing these parcels of land for development  amounting to million as of december  we expect to commence development on one of the land parcels during critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on the straight line basis from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to existing leases  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
lease incentives  which are included as reductions of rental revenue are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs 
for certain leases in the portfolio  there are significant assumptions and judgments made by management in determining the lease term such as when termination options are provided to the tenant 
the lease term impacts the period over which minimum rents are determined and recorded and also considers the period over which lease related costs are amortized 
in addition  our rental revenue is impacted by our determination of whether the improvements made by us or the tenant are landlord assets 
the determination of whether an asset is a landlord asset requires judgment and principally considers whether improvements would be utilizable by another tenant upon move out by the existing tenant 
to the extent they are determined not to be landlord assets  and we fund them  they are considered as lease incentives 
to the extent the tenant funds the improvements that we consider to be landlord assets  we treat them as deferred revenue which is amortized to revenue over the lease term 

table of contents real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost 
we record acquisition of real estate investments under the acquisition method of accounting and allocate the purchase price to land  buildings and intangible assets on a relative fair value basis 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful lives of buildings and capital improvements to years and over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset for tenant improvements 
direct construction costs related to the development of properties and land holdings are capitalized as incurred 
capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development and constructions costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  salaries and other project costs during the period of development 
estimates and judgments are required in determining when capitalization of certain costs such as interest should commence and cease 
we expense routine repair and maintenance expenditures and capitalize those items that extend the useful lives of the underlying assets 
real estate ventures when we obtain an economic interest in an entity  we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity vie  and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  in accordance with the accounting standard for the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this accounting standard requires significant use of judgments and estimates in determining its application 
if the entity is not deemed to be a vie  and we serve as the general partner or managing member within the entity  we evaluate to determine if our presumed control as the general partner or managing member is overcome by the kick out rights and other substantive participating rights of the limited partners or non managing members in accordance with the same accounting standard 
we consolidate i entities that are vies and of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we control 
entities that we account for under the equity method ie  at cost  increased or decreased by our share of earnings or losses  less distributions include i entities that are vies and of which we are not deemed the primary beneficiary ii entities that are non vies which we do not control  but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence and iii entities that are non vies which we maintain an ownership interest through our general partner status  but in which the limited partners in the entity have the substantive ability to dissolve the entity or remove us without cause or have substantive participating rights 
we continuously assess our determination of whether an entity is a vie and who the primary beneficiary is  and whether or not the limited partners in an entity have substantive rights  including if certain events occur that are likely to cause a change in original determinations 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment 
our estimates of value for each investment particularly in commercial real estate joint ventures are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and operating costs 
these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  accordingly  the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the long lived asset s use and eventual disposition 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of the investments in long lived assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
operating properties are also evaluated if they have been identified for potential sale 
no impairment was determined  however  if actual cash flows or the estimated holding periods change  an impairment could be recorded in the future and it could be material 
although our strategy is generally to hold our properties over the long term  we will dispose of properties to meet our liquidity needs or for other strategic needs 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized to reduce the property to the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred and the assets are classified as held and used  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 

table of contents where properties have been identified as having a potential for sale  additional judgments are required related to the determination as to the appropriate period over which the undiscounted cash flows should include the operating cash flows and the amount included as the estimated residual value 
management determines the amounts to be included based on a probability weighted cash flow analysis 
this requires significant judgment 
in some cases  the results of whether an impairment is indicated are sensitive to changes in assumptions input into the estimates  including the hold period until expected sale 
during our impairment review for and  we determined that no impairment charges were necessary 
we also entered into development agreements related to two parcels of land under option for ground lease that required us to commence development by december  during the current year  we were granted an extension to commence development by december  related to these development agreements  and will incur a million extension fee over the extension period 
if we determine that we will not be able to start the construction by the date specified  or if we determine that development is not in our best economic interest and an additional extension of the development period cannot be negotiated  we will have to write off all costs that we have incurred in preparing these parcels of land for development  amounting to million as of december  we expect to commence development on one of the land parcels during income taxes parent company the parent company has elected to be treated as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the internal revenue code 
in addition  the parent company may elect to treat one or more of its subsidiaries as reits 
in order to continue to qualify as a reit  the parent company and each of its reit subsidiaries are required to  among other things  distribute at least of their reit taxable income to their stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of their income and assets 
as reits  the parent company and its reit subsidiaries are not subject to federal income tax with respect to the portion of their income that meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to the stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the operations of these reits 
the parent company and its reit subsidiaries  if any  intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows them to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as reits 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the parent company or one of its reit subsidiaries were to fail to meet these requirements  they would be subject to federal income tax 
the parent company may elect to treat one or more of its subsidiaries as a taxable reit subsidiary  or trs 
in general  a trs may perform additional services for our tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or the provision to any person  under a franchise  license or otherwise  of rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated 
a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax 
the parent company has elected to treat certain of its corporate subsidiaries as trss  these entities provide third party property management services and certain services to tenants that could not otherwise be provided 
operating partnership in general  the operating partnership is not subject to federal and state income taxes  and accordingly  no provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the partners of the operating partnership are required to include their respective share of the operating partnership s profits or losses in their respective tax returns 
the operating partnership s tax returns and the amount of allocable partnership profits and losses are subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities 
if such examination results in changes to the operating partnership profits or losses  then the tax liability of the partners would be changed accordingly 
the operating partnership may elect to treat one or several of its subsidiaries as reits under sections through of the internal revenue code 
each subsidiary reit has met or intends to meet the requirements for treatment as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code  and  accordingly  no provision has been made for federal and state income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if any subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  that subsidiary reit will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a reit for the four subsequent taxable years 
also  each subsidiary reit may be subject to certain local income taxes 
the operating partnership has elected to treat several of its subsidiaries as taxable trss  which are subject to federal  state and local income tax 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents an estimate of losses that may be incurred from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
the allowance is an estimate based on two calculations that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have determined that a tenant may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these situations  we use our judgment  based on the facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that tenant against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to collect 
these reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
second  a reserve is established for all tenants based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
for accrued rent receivables  we consider the results of the evaluation of specific accounts as well as other factors including assigning risk factors to different industries based on our tenants standard industrial classification 
considering various factors including assigning a risk factor to different industries  these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience adjusted for current market conditions 
deferred costs we incur direct costs related to the financing  development and leasing of our properties 
management exercises judgment in determining whether such costs  particularly internal costs  meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed 
capitalized financing fees are amortized over the related loan term on a basis that approximates the effective interest method while capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related lease term 
management re evaluates the remaining useful lives of leasing costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants and economic and market conditions change 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on fair values 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancellable term of the lease includes the below market fixed renewal period  if applicable 
capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases 
capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases  including any fixed rate renewal periods 
other intangible assets also include amounts representing the value of tenant relationships and in place leases based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
we estimate the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in place leases  include leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
this intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases and any fixed rate bargain renewal periods 
we estimate fair value through methods similar to those used by independent appraisers or by using independent appraisals 
factors that we consider in our analysis include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from three to twelve months 
characteristics that we consider in allocating value to our tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our business relationship with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized over the remaining initial lease term and expected renewals  but in no event longer than the remaining depreciable life of the building 
the value of in place leases is amortized over the remaining non cancellable term of the respective leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
in the event that a tenant terminates its lease prior to the end of the lease term  the unamortized portion of each intangible  including market rate adjustments  in place lease values and tenant relationship values  would be charged to expense 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and we believe that presentation of our consolidated financial information  without a breakdown by segment  will effectively present important information useful to our investors 

table of contents net operating income noi as presented in the comparative analysis below is defined as total revenue less property operating expenses  real estate taxes and third party management expenses 
property operating expenses that are included in determining noi consist of costs that are necessary and allocable to our operating properties such as utilities  property level salaries  repairs and maintenance  property insurance  management fees and bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses that are not reflected in noi primarily consist of corporate level salaries  amortization of share awards and professional fees that are incurred as part of corporate office management 
noi is a non gaap financial measure that we use internally to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate assets by segment  as presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  and of our business as a whole 
we believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level 
while noi is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance 
noi also does not reflect general and administrative expenses  interest expenses  real estate impairment losses  depreciation and amortization costs  capital expenditures and leasing costs 
trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations are also not included in noi 
we believe that net income  as defined by gaap  is the most appropriate earnings measure 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of noi to our consolidated net income loss 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same store property portfolio and the total portfolio 
the same store property portfolio consists of properties containing an aggregate of approximately million net rentable square feet  and represents properties that we owned for the twelve month periods ended december  and the same store property portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to january  and owned through december  the total portfolio includes the effects of other properties that were either placed into service  acquired or redeveloped after january  or disposed prior to december  a property is excluded from our same store property portfolio and moved into the redevelopment column in the period that we determine that a redevelopment would be the best use of the asset  and when said asset is taken out of service or is undergoing re entitlement for a future development strategy 
this table also includes a reconciliation from the same store property portfolio to the total portfolio net income ie  all properties owned by us during the twelve month period ended december  and by providing information for the properties which were acquired  placed into service  under development or redevelopment and administrative elimination information for the three month periods ended december  and in thousands 
the total portfolio net income presented in the table is equal to the net income of the parent company and the operating partnership

this also includes two properties that were contributed to an unconsolidated real estate venture in which the company has a ownership interest 
d pertains to properties that are part of our core portfolio ie not under development  redevelopment  or re entitlement 

table of contents total revenue cash rents from the total portfolio decreased by million from to primarily reflecting a decrease of million of rental income as a result of contributing two properties to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures during the fourth quarter of this decrease was offset by an increase of million due to an increase in same store occupancy of basis points from to  an increase of million related to the placement into service of the juniper street garage and allendale road during the third quarter of  the acquisition of market street during the third quarter of  and the acquisition of west at lantana during the fourth quarter of  and  an increase of million related to the the redevelopment of west germantown pike and market street during straight line rents increased by million from to  consistent with the factors described above an increase of million due to an increase in same store occupancy of basis points from to  and an increase of million due to the placement in service  acquisition  and redevelopment of the above mentioned properties 
this increase was offset by million as a result of contributing two properties to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures during the fourth quarter of tenant reimbursements decreased million from to as a direct result of the million decrease in operating expenses over the same period 
please see the property operating expenses explanations below and note that certain costs  such as snow removal costs  carry a higher tenant reimbursement percentage 
termination fees at our total portfolio increased by million due to timing and volume of tenant move outs during when compared to other income at our total portfolio increased by million during compared to as a result of real estate tax refunds received related to prior years tax assessment appeals 
property operating expenses property operating expenses across our total portfolio decreased by million from to  mainly attributable to the following i a decrease of million in snow removal costs as a result of the mild winter experienced in our pennsylvania and new jersey submarkets during as compared to  ii a decrease of million related to lower utility costs  iii a decrease of million as a result of contributing two properties to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures during the fourth quarter of  iv a decrease of million in repairs and maintenance expenses  directly attributable to timing and tenant needs  and v a decrease of million in contracted janitorial and landscaping expenses as a result of entering into contracts at more favorable rates during as compared to these decreases were offset by i an increase of million in salaries  bonuses and related benefits from to  ii an increase of million due to the acquisition or placement in service of certain properties throughout and  as mentioned above  and iii an increase of million in state and local taxes during  consistent with an increase in tax rates during the year 
real estate taxes real estate taxes across our total portfolio increased by million  primarily as a result of an increase in real estate tax rates across our same store portfolio during compared to of million 
the increase was offset by a million decrease in real estate tax expenses for the two properties contributed to an unconsolidated real estate venture in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million from to  mainly attributable to an increase in the amortization of performance based compensation of million 
this increase is due to the fact that we accelerated the amortization of such compensation subsequent to certain of our executive personnel meeting qualifying retirement conditions during  causing their associated performance based compensation to fully vest please refer to footnote of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
this increase is offset by a decrease in acquisition costs of million from to 
table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million  mainly attributable to a decrease of million as a result of contributing two properties to one of our unconsolidated joint ventures during the fourth quarter of during  we also recorded a million out of period adjustment for intangible assets representing tenant relationships and in place leases that should have been written off in prior years 
the remaining decreases are due to decreases related to asset write offs related to early move outs and fully amortized assets in  without comparable expenses in these decreases were offset by an increase of million related to the additional depreciation and amortization expense from the aforementioned properties that we acquired  placed into service  or redeveloped during interest income interest income increased by million primarily due to the recognition of million of accrued interest income related to the payoff of the trenton note receivable during the year ended december  the installment sale method was used to account for the transaction as a result of the note receivable  and therefore interest income is recognized on a cash basis 
we recognized all of the interest income accrued to date during the year ended december  upon receipt of payment from the borrower 
see discontinued operations section below 
interest expense the increase in interest expense of million is primarily due to the following an increase of million as a result of the incurrence of million in new term loans which closed on february   an increase of million in swap interest expense 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements related to all of our variable rate debt except million of term loan indebtedness and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  an increase of million related to our million guaranteed notes due issued in april  and  an increase of million related to our million guaranteed notes due issued in december the increase of million in interest expense described above was offset by the following decreases in interest expense during compared to decrease of million related to our million guaranteed notes that matured and were repaid in full during april decrease of million in mortgage interest expense which is directly related to the million decrease in mortgage indebtedness during and the million decrease during  decrease of million related to the repurchases of debt subsequent to the fourth quarter of  including i million of our guaranteed notes due  ii million of our guaranteed notes due  and iii million of our guaranteed notes due  decrease of million related to the extinguishment of our prior term loans  and  decrease in interest expense of million related to an increase in capitalized interest 
interest expense deferred financing costs deferred financing costs increased million during compared to mainly due to the write off of costs related to repurchases of debt during  which included  i million of our guaranteed notes due  ii million of our guaranteed notes due  iii million of our guaranteed notes due  iv million of our guaranteed notes due and v million of term loan indebtedness 
recognized hedge activity recognized hedge activity increased million during due to the recognition of million of early termination fees related to the termination of interest rate swap contracts 
the interest rate swap contracts were terminated in connection with the repayment of the company million fixed portion of its four year term loan due february  during the fourth quarter of see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details of these transactions 
there were no comparable charges incurred during 
table of contents interest expense financing obligation financing obligation interest expense relates to a property that we contributed to a joint venture in the fourth quarter of that did not qualify for sale accounting  and therefore increased by million during as compared to the interest primarily represents our partner share of the net operating income of the property

liquidity and capital resources of the parent company the parent company conducts its business through the operating partnership and the parent company only material asset is its ownership of interests in the operating partnership 
the parent company  other than acting as the sole general partner of the operating partnership  issues equity from time to time  the proceeds of which it contributes to the operating partnership in exchange for additional interests in the operating partnership  and guarantees debt obligations of the operating partnership 
the parent company s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common shares and preferred shares 
the parent company s source of funding for its dividend payments and other obligations is the distributions it receives from the operating partnership 
as of december   the parent company owned a interest in the operating partnership 
the remaining interest of approximately pertains to common limited partnership interests owned by non affiliated investors who contributed property 
table of contents to the operating partnership in exchange for their interests 
as the sole general partner of the operating partnership  the parent company has full and complete responsibility for the operating partnership s day to day operations and management 
as noted above  the parent company s only source of capital other than proceeds of equity issuances which the parent company contributes to the operating partnership is distributions it receives from the operating partnership 
the parent company believes that the operating partnership s sources of working capital  particularly its cash flows from operations and borrowings available under its credit facility  are adequate for the operating partnership to make its distributions to the parent company  which in turn enables the parent company to make dividend payments to its shareholders 
the parent company s ability to sell common shares and preferred shares is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about the company as a whole and the current trading price of the parent company shares 
the parent company regularly analyzes which source of capital is most advantageous to it at any particular point in time 
in march  the parent company commenced a continuous equity offering program the offering program  under which it may sell  in at the market offerings  up to an aggregate amount of  common shares until march  the parent company may sell common shares in amounts and at times to be determined by the parent company 
actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the parent company  including market conditions  the trading price of its common shares and determinations by the parent company of the appropriate sources of funding 
in conjunction with the offering program  the parent company engages sales agents who receive compensation  in aggregate  of up to of the gross sales price per share sold 
during the twelve months ended december   the parent company did not sell any shares under the offering program 
from inception of the offering program through december   the parent company has sold  shares under the program at an average sales price of per share  resulting in  remaining shares available for sale 
the parent company contributed the net proceeds from the sales to the operating partnership  which the operating partnership in turn used to repay its debt and for general corporate purposes 
the parent company is currently evaluating an extension of the offering program subsequent to its scheduled expiration date 
on april   the parent company closed on a registered public offering of  shares of series e preferred shares at a price to the public of per share 
dividends on the series e preferred shares are payable quarterly in arrears on or about the th day of each january  april  july  and october  commencing july   at a rate per annum of of the liquidation value of per share equivalent to per share per annum 
net proceeds from this offering totaled approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount and our related expenses 
on may   the parent company used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of series e preferred shares to redeem all  shares of its then outstanding series c preferred shares at a redemption price of million plus million of dividends accrued through the redemption date 
on december  the parent company used available cash balances to redeem all  shares of its then outstanding series d cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a redemption price of million plus million of dividends accrued through the redemption date 
the company recognized million of redemption costs million and million related to the series c and series d redemptions  respectively associated with the total aforementioned redemptions as a reduction in net earnings to arrive at net income applicable to common shares 
these costs are shown within the company consolidated statements of operations as preferred share redemption charge 
there were no comparable charges for the prior year 
on december   the parent company declared a distribution of per common share  totaling million  which it paid on january  to its shareholders of record as of january  in addition  the parent company declared distributions on its series e preferred shares to holders of record as of december   and paid the declared distributions on january  in the aggregate amount of million 
the parent company also maintains a share repurchase program under which its board of trustees has authorized the parent company to repurchase its common shares from time to time 
as of december   there were approximately million shares remaining to be repurchased under this program 
the parent company s board of trustees has not limited the duration of the program and it may be terminated  or replenished by the board of trustees  at any time 
together with the operating partnership  the parent company maintains a shelf registration statement that has registered the offering and sale of common shares  preferred shares  depositary shares  warrants and unsecured debt securities 
subject to the company s ongoing compliance with securities laws  and if warranted by market conditions  the parent company and the operating partnership may offer and sell equity and debt securities from time to time under the shelf registration statement 

table of contents the parent company unconditionally guarantees the operating partnership s secured and unsecured obligations  which  as of december   amounted to million and  million  respectively 
if the operating partnership fails to comply with its debt requirements  the parent company will be required to fulfill the operating partnership s commitments under such guarantees 
however  the parent company only material asset is its interest in the operating partnership 
as of december   the operating partnership was in compliance with all of its debt covenant and requirement obligations 
in order to maintain its qualification as a reit  the parent company is required to  among other things  pay dividends to its shareholders of at least of its reit taxable income 
the parent company has historically satisfied this requirement 
overall  and as discussed above  the liquidity of the parent company is dependent on the operating partnership s distributions to the parent company and thus is dependent on the operating partnership s access to sources of capital 
liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership general the operating partnership s principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are as follows fund normal recurring expenses  fund capital expenditures  including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund principal payments on our secured debt  fund current development and redevelopment costs  and fund distributions to the parent company 
the operating partnership believes that with uncertain economic conditions  vacancy rates may increase  effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may decrease and tenant installation costs  including concessions  may increase in most or all of its markets throughout and possibly beyond 
as a result  the operating partnership s revenues and cash flows could be insufficient to cover operating expenses  including increased tenant installation costs over the short term 
if this situation were to occur  the operating partnership expects that it would finance cash deficits through borrowings under the new credit facility and other sources of debt and equity financings 
the operating partnership believes that its liquidity needs will be satisfied through available cash balances and cash flows generated by operations  financing activities and selective property sales 
rental revenue  expense recoveries from tenants  and other income from operations are its principal sources of cash that it uses to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain its reit qualification 
the operating partnership seeks to increase cash flows from its properties by maintaining quality standards for its properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
the operating partnership s revenue also includes third party fees generated by its property management  leasing  development and construction businesses 
the operating partnership believes that its revenue  together with proceeds from property sales and debt financings  will continue to provide funds for its short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in its operating or financing activities may adversely affect its net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect its ability to fund distributions to the parent company  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in cash provided by operations would affect the financial performance covenants under its credit facility  unsecured term loans and unsecured notes  and the availability of borrowings under the credit facility 
financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty 
the operating partnership s ability to fund development projects  as well as its ability to repay or refinance debt maturities could be adversely affected by its inability to secure financing at reasonable terms beyond those already completed 
it is possible  in these unusual and uncertain times that one or more lenders in its credit facility could fail to fund a borrowing request 
such an event could adversely affect its ability to access funds from its credit facility when needed 
the operating partnership s liquidity management remains a priority 
the operating partnership regularly pursues new financing opportunities to ensure an appropriate balance sheet position 
as a result of these dedicated efforts  the operating partnership is comfortable with its ability to meet future debt maturities and development or property acquisition funding needs 
the operating partnership believes that its current balance sheet is in an adequate position at the date of this filing  despite the volatility in the credit and financial markets 
the operating partnership uses multiple financing sources to fund its long term capital needs 
when needed  it will use borrowings under its new credit facility for general business purposes  including the acquisition  development and redevelopment of properties 
table of contents and the repayment of other debt 
it will also consider other properties within its portfolio as necessary  where it may be in its best interest to obtain a secured mortgage 
the operating partnership s ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including its credit ratings  the value of its unencumbered assets  its degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by its current lenders 
if more than one rating agency were to downgrade its credit rating  the operating partnership access to capital in the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under its new credit facility and the new term loans would increase 
the ability of the parent company and the operating partnership to sell their equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about the company and the current trading price of the parent company s shares 
the parent company contributes the proceeds it receives from its equity issuances to the operating partnership in exchange for partnership units of the operating partnership in accordance with the operating partnership s partnership agreement 
the operating partnership uses the net proceeds from the sales contributed by the parent company to repay its debt and for general corporate purposes 
the operating partnership  from time to time  also issues its own partnership units as consideration for property acquisitions and developments 
the operating partnership will also consider sales of selected properties as another source of managing its liquidity 
asset sales during and through have been a source of cash 
during  the parent company sold properties containing million in net rentable square feet for net cash proceeds of million 
during  the parent company also contributed million to fund the acquisition of three office buildings  containing million in net rentable square feet  to an unconsolidated joint venture in silver spring  maryland  as well as a acre parcel of land to an unconsolidated joint venture in plymouth meeting  pennsylvania  receiving a interest in each of the respective ventures 
the operating partnership has used proceeds from asset sales to repay existing indebtedness  provide capital for its development activities and strengthen its financial condition 
there is no guarantee that it will be able to raise similar or even lesser amounts of capital from future asset sales 
cash flows the following discussion of the operating partnership s cash flows is based on the consolidated statement of cash flows and is not meant to be a comprehensive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented 
as of december  and  the operating partnership maintained cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively

the operating partnership does not restate its cash flow for discontinued operations

the operating partnership sold a total of properties during the timing of cash receipts and cash expenditures in the normal course of operations 
the net increase of million in cash used in investing activities of the operating partnership during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the following an increase of million of investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures during the year ended december   primarily reflecting million that was contributed to fund our share of an acquisition of three office properties by the brandywine ai venture  million that was contributed to two real estate ventures to repay our share of their mortgage indebtedness  and million that was contributed to a real estate venture to fund our share of its operations

interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the operating partnership s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates 
the range of changes chosen reflects its view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen 

table of contents the operating partnership s financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   its consolidated debt consisted of million of mortgage loans and  million of unsecured notes  all of which are fixed rate borrowings 
we also have variable rate debt consisting of million in borrowings under our new credit facility  million in trust preferred securities and million of unsecured term loans  both of which are swapped to fixed except for million of unsecured term loans which bear interest at a variable rate of interest 
all financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
if market rates of interest increase by basis points  the fair value of the operating partnership s outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decrease by basis points  the fair value of its outstanding fixed rate mortgage debt would increase by approximately million 
as of december   based on prevailing interest rates and credit spreads  the fair value of the operating partnership s  million of unsecured notes was  million 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of the operating partnership s debt of approximately million at december  from time to time or as the need arises  the operating partnership uses derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk exposures and not for speculative purposes 
the total carrying value of the operating partnership s variable rate debt including variable swapped to fixed was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the total fair value of the operating partnership s debt was approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of its debt of million at december  and a basis point change in the discount rate equates to a change in the total fair value of its debt of approximately million at december  at december   the operating partnership s outstanding variable rate debt based on libor totaled approximately million  of which million remained variable  with the remaining million being swapped to fixed 
at december   the interest rate on the operating partnership variable rate debt was approximately 
if market interest rates on its variable rate debt were to change by basis points  total interest expense would have changed by approximately million for year ended december  these amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the operating partnership s financial instruments 
due to the uncertainty of specific actions it may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases  this analysis assumes no changes in its financial structure 
funds from operations ffo pursuant to the revised definition of ffo adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  we calculate ffo by adjusting net income loss attributable to common unit holders computed in accordance with gaap for gains or losses from sales of properties  impairment losses on depreciable consolidated real estate  impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated real estate ventures 
ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
the operating partnership believes that the use of ffo combined with the required us gaap presentations  has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reits operating results more meaningful 
the operating partnership considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and real estate depreciation and amortization  ffo can help the investing public compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies 
the operating partnership s computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently 
the operating partnership considers net income  as defined by us gaap  to be the most comparable earnings measure to ffo 
while ffo and ffo per unit are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of reits  ffo does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by us gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to those measures in evaluating the company s liquidity or operating performance 
the operating partnership believes that to further understand 
table of contents our performance  ffo should be compared with its reported net income loss attributable to common unit holders and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with gaap  as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents a reconciliation of net income loss attributable to common unit holders to ffo for the years ended december  and year ended year ended december  december  amounts in thousands  except share information net income loss attributable to common unitholders add deduct amount allocated to unvested restricted unitholders net gain on sale of interests in real estate net gain on sale of undepreciated real estate loss on real estate venture formation net gain on disposition of discontinued operations depreciation and amortization real property continuing operations leasing costs including acquired intangibles continuing operations real property discontinued operations leasing costs including acquired intangibles discontinued operations company s share of unconsolidated real estate ventures funds from operations funds from operations allocable to unvested restricted shareholders funds from operations available to common share and unit holders ffo weighted average shares units outstanding fully diluted item a
