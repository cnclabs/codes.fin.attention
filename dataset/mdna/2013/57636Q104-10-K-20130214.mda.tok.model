net revenue generated in the united states was  and of total net revenue in  and  respectively 
no individual country  other than the united states  generated more than of total revenues in any period  but differences in market growth  economic health  and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time 
while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries  the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 
the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business 
unprecedented events which began during impacted the financial markets around the world  including continued distress in the credit environment  continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention 
the economies of the united states and numerous countries around the world were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil 
countries have experienced credit ratings actions by ratings agencies  including several in europe as well as the united states 
in addition  some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments 
many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence  including potential further changes in laws and regulations 
many of our financial institution customers  merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 
mastercard s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies 
the condition of the economic environments may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance 
as a result  our revenue may be negatively impacted  or the company may be impacted in several ways 
mastercard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry 
for example  in our asia pacific and latin american regions  we continue to see significant increases in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in those regions while in the united states and europe we have experienced growth in dollar volume despite mixed economic indicators 
notwithstanding recent encouraging trends  the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business

impact of foreign currency rates our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real 
the functional currency of mastercard europe  our principal european operating subsidiary  is the euro  and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real 
accordingly  the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the us dollar 
for as compared to  the us dollar strengthened against both the euro and the brazilian real 
for compared to  the us dollar weakened against both the euro and the brazilian real 
accordingly  the net foreign currency impact of changes in the us dollar average exchange rates against the euro and brazilian real decreased net income in compared to by percentage points 
conversely  net income in was positively impacted by currency by approximately percentage points 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gdv and gross euro volume gev  which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments  cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives 
in most non european regions  gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period 
in europe  gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period 
as a result  our domestic assessments  cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus primarily non european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus primarily european local currencies 
the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv growth on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on a local currency basis 
in  gdv on a us dollar converted basis increased  versus gdv growth on a local currency basis of

table of contents financial results revenues revenue description mastercard s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders  merchants  issuers the cardholders financial institutions and acquirers the merchants financial institutions 
our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands  the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other payment related services we provide to our customers 
our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers 
our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar  euro and brazilian real 
our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes  types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers 
the following factors impact pricing domestic or cross border signature based credit and debit or pin based debit  including automated teller machine atm cash withdrawals and retail purchases tiered rates that fluctuate based on volume transaction hurdles geographic region or country retail purchase or cash withdrawal processed or not processed by mastercard in general  a cross border transaction generates higher revenue than a domestic transaction since cross border fees are higher than domestic fees  and in most cases also include fees for currency conversion 
we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis 
in addition  standard pricing varies among our regions  and such standard pricing can be modified for our customers through customer specific incentive and rebate agreements 
the company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories domestic assessments domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards and other devices that carry our brands where the merchant country and the issuer country are the same 
a portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage purchases  cash disbursements  balance transfers and convenience checks from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price 
in addition  domestic assessments include items such as card assessments  which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes  such as acceptance development or market development programs 
acceptance development fees are charged primarily to us issuers based on components of volume  and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale

cross border volume fees also include fees charged to issuers for performing currency conversion services 

table of contents transaction processing fees transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions

authorization refers to the process by which a transaction is routed to the issuer for approval and then a decision whether or not to approve the transaction is made by the issuer or  in certain circumstances such as when the issuer systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted  by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer instructions or applicable rules also known as stand in 
our standards  which may vary across regions  establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions

mastercard clears transactions among customers through our central and regional processing systems 
fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers 
settlement 
once transactions have been authorized and cleared  mastercard helps to settle the transactions by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties 
once clearing is completed  a daily reconciliation is provided to each customer involved in settlement  detailing the net amounts by clearing cycle and a final settlement position 
fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers 
connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access  equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages 
these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company s network 
other revenues other revenues for other payment related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors  such as contractual agreements 
examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions 
this includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants

rebates and incentives contra revenue rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra revenue in the same period that revenue is earned or performance occurs 
performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive  including commitments to the agreement term  hurdles for volumes  transactions or issuance of new cards  launch of new programs  or the execution of marketing programs

payments due by period total and thereafter in millions capital leases operating leases other long term obligations sponsorship  licensing and other employee benefits total the capital lease for the global technology and operations center located in o fallon  missouri has been excluded from this table  since the company holds refunding revenue bonds equal to the payments due on the lease 
see note property  plant and equipment included in part ii  item of this report for further information 
the table does not include the million provision as of december  related to the proposed settlement of the us merchant class litigation since the company has made a payment into escrow to fund the settlement 
see note legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report for further discussion 
amounts primarily relate to sponsorships to promote the mastercard brand and amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements that are fixed and non cancelable 
future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are contingent on future performance 
mastercard has accrued billion as of december  related to customer and merchant agreements 
the company has recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million at december  and estimates that approximately million of this liability is expected to be settled within the next months 
these amounts have been excluded from the table since the settlement period for the non current portion of this liability cannot be reasonably estimated 
the timing of these payments will ultimately depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various authorities 
seasonality the company does not experience meaningful seasonality 
no individual quarter in  or accounted for more than of net revenues 
critical accounting estimates the application of us gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect the company reported financial condition 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period 
the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to its financial statements 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to the company financial condition 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the company board of directors 
the company significant accounting policies  including recent accounting pronouncements  are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available  can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors 
the amounts used to assess sensitivity eg  percent are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management predictions of variability 
for all of these estimates  it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and estimates require regular review and adjustment 
rebates and incentives rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates of each customer future performance according to the terms of the related customer agreements 
we consider various factors in estimating customer performance  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience with that customer and market and economic conditions 
differences between actual results and the company estimates are adjusted in the period the customer reports actual performance 

table of contents if our customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  contra revenues may be materially different than initially estimated 
if the company estimate of customer performance was higher  net revenue would have been reduced by approximately million in loss contingencies the company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
the company regularly reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  the company reassesses the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 
income taxes in calculating our effective tax rate  we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions 
through our interpretation of local tax regulations  adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results may be materially different than the estimated amounts 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset  we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such a determination is made  with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
we consider all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and  if so  how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements 
if upon examination  we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained  this would decrease or increase earnings in the period 
in certain situations  the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 
we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations 
we consider business plans  planning opportunities  and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations 
if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations  us income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period 
valuation of assets the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to estimate the fair value of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill 
impairment testing for assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required  an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets 
the company s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these valuations require the use of management s assumptions  which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist 
in the fourth quarter of  the company early adopted new financial accounting standards board fasb guidance that simplifies how an entity tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  allowing a qualitative assessment to be performed  which is similar to the fasb guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment 
in performing these qualitative assessments  we consider relevant events and conditions  including but not limited to  macroeconomic trends  industry and market conditions  overall financial performance  cost factors  company specific events  legal and regulatory factors and the company market capitalization 
if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit 
table of contents or indefinite lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts  the company must perform a quantitative impairment test 
after performing the annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment qualitative reviews during the fourth quarter of  the company determined it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk 
our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity price risk is limited 
management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our funding  investments and use of derivative financial instruments 
we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 
the effect of a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates could result in a fair value loss of approximately million on our foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at december  related to the hedging program 
a basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company financial assets or liabilities at december  and in addition  there was no material equity price risk at december  or the dodd frank act includes provisions related to derivative financial instruments and the company is determining what impact  if any  such provisions will have on the company financial position or results of operations 
foreign exchange risk we enter into forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies 
we also enter into forward contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity holding the assets and liabilities 
the objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies  principally the us dollar and euro 
the notional value of commitments to sell foreign currency increased to billion at december  compared to million at december  due to the hedging of an increase in assets denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity holding the assets and an expanded hedging program to offset the company foreign currency exposures arising from anticipated receipts and disbursements 
the terms of the forward contracts are generally less than months 
as of december   all forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency had been entered into with customers of mastercard 
mastercard s derivative contracts are summarized below december  december  notional estimated fair value notional estimated fair value in millions commitments to purchase foreign currency commitments to sell foreign currency our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
this risk is typically limited to the one business day between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions 

table of contents interest rate risk our interest rate sensitive assets are our investments in debt securities  which we generally hold as available for sale investments 
our general policy is to invest in high quality securities  while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure 
the fair value and maturity distribution of the company available for sale investments as of december was as follows maturity fair market value at december  and there after financial instrument summary terms in millions municipal securities fixed variable interest corporate securities fixed variable interest us government and agency securities fixed variable interest taxable short term bond funds fixed variable interest asset backed securities fixed variable interest auction rate securities variable interest other fixed variable interest total short term bond funds of million have no contractual maturity

at december   we have a credit facility which provides liquidity for general corporate purposes  including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by the company customers 
this credit facility has variable rates  which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in the agreement 
see note debt to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for additional information on the company current and prior credit facilities 
we had no borrowings under the current or prior credit facilities at december  or equity price risk the company did not have significant equity price risk as of december  and
