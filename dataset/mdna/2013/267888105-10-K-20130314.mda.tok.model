item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes  as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
unless stated otherwise  all dollar figures in this discussion are presented in thousands s 
executive overview our business is organized into three segments explosive metalworking which we also refer to as nobelclad  oilfield products and amk welding 
in  explosive metalworking accounted for of our net sales and of our income from operations before consideration of unallocated corporate expenses and stock based compensation expense  which are not allocated to our business segments 
our oilfield products and amk welding segments accounted for and  respectively  of our net sales  and and  respectively  of our income from operations before unallocated corporate expenses and stock based compensation expense 
in and  explosive metalworking accounted for and of our net sales  respectively  and and  respectively  of income from operations before unallocated corporate expenses and stock based compensation expense 
our net sales decreased by  or  compared to net sales 
this sales decline includes an unfavorable foreign exchange translation adjustment of  that relates principally to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro during excluding the impact of this foreign exchange adjustment  the decrease in our consolidated net sales was negligible 
the year to year consolidated net sales decrease reflects sales decreases of  and  for our explosive metalworking and amk welding segments  respectively  that were partially offset by a sales increase of  for our oilfield products segment 
as a result of an improvement in our consolidated gross margin rate to in from in  our consolidated gross profit increased by  or  despite the drop in our consolidated net sales 
this increase in gross profit was offset by a  or  increase in our total operating expenses  resulting in a slight decrease in our consolidated income from operations to  in from  in the same period of this decrease reflects increases of  and in the operating income reported by our explosive metalworking and oilfield products segments  respectively  which were offset by a  decrease in amk welding s operating income of and increases in unallocated corporate expenses and stock based compensation expense of and  respectively 
reported consolidated operating income for and for includes amortization expense of  and  respectively  relating to purchased intangible assets associated with several acquisitions executed between november and january we reported net income of  in compared to  in impact of current economic situation on the company 
we were only minimally impacted in by the global economic slowdown 
however  during and  we experienced a significant slowdown in explosive metalworking sales to some of the markets we serve 
the explosion welded clad plate market is dependent upon sales of products for use by customers in a number of heavy industries  including oil and gas  chemicals and petrochemicals  aluminum production  power generation  shipbuilding  industrial refrigeration  alternative energy and hydrometallurgy 
these industries tend to be cyclical in nature and the uneven worldwide economic recovery has affected many of these markets 
while certain sectors continue to be slow  including alternative energy  hydrometallurgy and power generation  quoting activity in other end markets remains healthy  and we continue to track an extensive list of projects 
while timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict  our explosive metalworking segment benefited from the modest improvement during and in some of the industries it supplies and we believe that it is well positioned to further benefit as global economic conditions improve 
as a result of acquisitions made during  and and strong organic sales growth beginning in the third quarter of and continuing through the second quarter of  our oilfield products segment has grown into a second core business for us  generating of our consolidated net sales in as compared to only of our consolidated net sales in our explosive metalworking backlog was  at december  compared to  at december  based upon the december  explosive metalworking backlog  recent quoting activity for this segment and expected year over year sales increases for both our oilfield products and amk welding business segments  we believe 
table of contents that our consolidated net sales could increase by to from the  in consolidated net sales that we reported in net sales explosive metalworking s revenues are generated principally from sales of clad metal plates and sales of transition joints  which are made from clad plates  to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries  including oil and gas  petrochemicals  alternative energy  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  industrial refrigeration  and similar industries 
while a large portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by new plant construction and large plant expansion projects  maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing  oil refining  and aluminum smelting facilities also account for a significant portion of total demand 
oilfield products revenues are generated principally from sales of shaped charges  detonators and detonating cord  and bidirectional boosters and perforating guns to customers who perform the perforation of oil and gas wells and from sales of seismic products to customers involved in oil and gas exploration activities 
amk welding s revenues are generated from welding  heat treatment  and inspection services that are provided with respect to customer supplied parts for customers primarily involved in the power generation industry and aircraft engine markets 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis  to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
we attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing aggressively on the basis of price 
gross profit and cost of products sold cost of products sold for explosive metalworking includes the cost of metals and alloys used to manufacture clad metal plates  the cost of explosives  employee compensation and benefits  freight  outside processing costs  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
cost of products sold for oilfield products includes the cost of metals  explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges  detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
amk welding s cost of products sold consists principally of employee compensation and benefits  welding supplies wire and gas  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  outside services and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
backlog we use backlog as a primary means of measuring the immediate outlook for our explosive metalworking business 
we define backlog at any given point in time as consisting of all firm  unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time 
generally speaking  we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following months 
from experience  most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized 
our backlog with respect to the explosive metalworking segment increased slightly to  at december  from  at december  forward looking statements this annual report and the documents incorporated by reference into it contain certain forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigations reform act of these statements include information with respect to our anticipated future financial condition and results of operations and businesses

these forward looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include the ability to obtain new contracts at attractive prices  the size and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in customer demand  general economic conditions  both domestically and abroad  and their effect on us and our customers  competitive factors  the timely completion of contracts  the timing and size of expenditures  the timely receipt of government approvals and permits  the adequacy of local labor supplies at our facilities  the availability and cost of funds  and fluctuations in foreign currencies 
the effects of these factors are difficult to predict 
new factors emerge from time to time and we cannot assess the potential impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date of this annual report  and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events

our beginning of the year explosive metalworking backlog decreased to  at the beginning of from  at the beginning of the  decrease in year to year sales follows this  decrease in beginning of the year backlog 
the backlog at the beginning of was favorably impacted by two large orders that we booked in december of we did not see similar large order activity near the end of either or when our year end backlog stood at  and  respectively 
oilfield products contributed  to sales in of total sales compared to  in of total sales  which represents a sales increase of 
excluding incremental sales of  from our acquisition of trx  oilfield products sales decreased  or 
this decrease is principally attributable to a decline in rig count in both the united states and canada during last the first six months of which negatively affected our north america sales for this same period 

table of contents amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales  a decrease of 
this decrease reflects a  or  decline in ground power sales that is attributable to a customer s decision to discontinue new production work on a ground turbine platform that has accounted for a major portion of amk s historical ground power revenues 
we believe that amk can replace this lost revenue stream over time by developing new business opportunities with both existing and new customers in the aircraft engine  ground turbine  and oil and gas industries 
gross profit percentage change change gross profit consolidated gross profit margin rate gross profit increased by to  in from  in  including the negative impact of  in unfavorable foreign exchange translation adjustments relating principally to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 
our consolidated gross profit margin rate increased to from in the gross profit margin for explosive metalworking increased from in to in oilfield products gross margin increased to in from in the gross profit margin for amk welding decreased to in from in the significant improvement in the gross profit margin rate for our explosive metalworking segment relates to favorable changes in product mix as compared to combined with an improved pricing environment 
as has been the case historically  we expect to see continued fluctuations in explosive metalworking s quarterly gross margin rates in the future that result from fluctuations in quarterly sales volume and changes in product mix 
the modest increase in oilfield products gross margin rate in relates principally to favorable changes in product customer mix 
the decrease in amk welding s reported gross margin relates principally to differences in the rate at which amk welding absorbed its fixed manufacturing overhead costs based on the sales decrease discussed above 
based upon the expected contribution to consolidated net sales by each of our three business segments  we expect our consolidated full year gross margin to be in a range of to as compared to the gross margin that we reported for general and administrative expenses percentage change change general and administrative expenses percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in this increase includes increases of  in salaries and accrued incentive compensation due principally to the addition of kevin longe  chief operating officer  in july and the hiring of other administrative personnel during the year  an increase in stock based compensation of and a net increase of in all other expense categories

our consolidated selling and distribution expenses include  and  for our explosive metalworking and oilfield products business segments  respectively 
the higher level of selling and distribution expenses for our oilfield products segment relative to its contribution to our consolidated net sales reflects the need  particularly in north america  to maintain a number of strategically located distribution centers that are in close proximity to areas which contain a large concentration of oilfields and enjoy a high volume of related oil and gas drilling activities

these aggregate non cash charges represent a significant percentage of the consolidated operating income that we reported for these periods 
we use non gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda in our operational and financial decision making and believe that these non gaap measures are a reliable indicator of our ability to generate cash flow from operations and facilitate a more meaningful comparison of the operating performance of our three business segments than do certain gaap measures 
research analysts  investment bankers and lenders also use ebitda and adjusted ebitda to assess operating performance

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow  revolving credit borrowings  various long term debt arrangements  and the issuance of common stock 
we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital  debt service  and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
nevertheless  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies 
if we are unable to i realize sales from our backlog  ii secure new customer orders at attractive prices  and iii continue to implement cost effective internal processes  our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities could be impacted 
furthermore  any restriction on the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements 
we are constructing new production facilities in russia and the united states and are anticipating total capital expenditures of approximately million on these two projects 
approximately million of this total has been spent through december  and additional spending of more than million is expected during debt facilities on december   we entered into a five year syndicated credit agreement  which provides revolving loan availability of   euros and  canadian dollars through a syndicate of four banks  and amends and restates in its entirety our prior syndicated credit agreement entered into on november  our prior syndicated credit agreement provided for revolving loan availability of  and  euros  and also had a remaining balance of  outstanding under a  term loan

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our historical consolidated financial statements and notes to our historical consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity 
existing rules must be interpreted and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us 
in management s opinion  the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are revenue recognition  asset impairments  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income taxes 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  and actual results could differ from the estimates  as additional information becomes known 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of clad metal products and welding services are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used  services performed and the results of any non destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed 
all issues of conformity of the product to specifications are resolved before the product is shipped and billed 
products related to the oilfield products segment  which include detonating cords  detonators  bi directional boosters and shaped charges  as well as  seismic related explosives and accessories  are standard in nature 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
for contracts that require multiple shipments  revenue is recorded only for the units included in each individual shipment 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a probable loss  we will account for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments we review our long lived assets to be held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  we estimate the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
business combinations we account for our business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the total cost of the acquisition to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
as part of this allocation process  we identify and attribute values and estimated lives to the intangible assets acquired 
these determinations involve significant estimates and assumptions regarding multiple  highly subjective variables  including those with respect to future cash flows  discount rates  asset lives  and the use of different valuation models and therefore require considerable judgment 
our estimates and assumptions are based  in part  on the availability of listed market prices or other transparent market data 
these determinations affect the amount of amortization expense recognized in future periods 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually to assess impairment because it is not amortized 
additionally  we review the carrying value of any intangible asset or goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances  many of which are subjective in nature  include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy  a significant decrease in the market 
table of contents value of the asset  and a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset 
if an impairment indicator is present  we perform an analysis to confirm whether an impairment has actually occurred and if so  the amount of the required impairment charge 
we assess impairment by comparing the fair value of an identifiable intangible asset or goodwill with its carrying value 
the determination of fair value involves significant management judgment and assumptions  including assumptions regarding estimated useful lives  revenue growth  operating margins  future market conditions and discount rates 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level on at least an annual basis 
a reporting unit is a group of businesses i for which discrete financial information is available and ii that have similar economic characteristics 
we test goodwill for impairment first by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and then comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if carrying value exceeds fair value for any reporting unit  then we calculate and compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill and record an impairment charge for any excess of carrying value over implied fair value 
our impairment testing has not resulted in a determination that any of our goodwill was impaired 
a future impairment is possible and could occur if i operating results underperform what we have estimated or ii additional volatility of the capital markets or other factors should cause us to raise the percent discount rate utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis or decrease the multiples utilized in our market based analysis 
the use of different estimates or assumptions within our discounted cash flow model when determining the fair value of our reporting units or using methodologies other than as described above could result in different values for reporting units and could result in an impairment charge 
finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators are present 
we compare the expected undiscounted future operating cash flows associated with these finite lived assets to their respective carrying values to determine if they are fully recoverable 
if the expected future operating cash flows of an asset are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  we estimate the fair value of the asset 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and when the carrying value exceeds fair value 
the projected cash flows require several assumptions related to  among other things  relevant market factors  revenue growth  if any  and operating margins 
income taxes we are required to recognize deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in our financial statements but not our tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on income tax credits and on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine if they will  more likely than not  be recovered from future projected taxable income  if not  we record an appropriate valuation allowance 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations  assets or liabilities other than those appearing or disclosed in our financial statements forming part of this annual report  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
recent accounting pronouncements please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their anticipated effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates 
periodically  we use interest rate swaps to stabilize funding costs by managing the 
table of contents exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of our assets and liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rate risk management 
foreign currency risk our consolidated financial statements are expressed in us dollars  but a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
changes in the exchange rates for such currencies into us dollars can affect our revenues  earnings  and the carrying value of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  either positively or negatively 
sales made in currencies other than us dollars accounted for   and of total sales for the years ended   and  respectively
