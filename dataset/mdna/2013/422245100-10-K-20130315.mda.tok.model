we also provide services to commercial healthcare businesses and or government entities in brazil  australia and france 
we operate domestic and international well being improvement call centers staffed with licensed health professionals 
our fitness center network encompasses approximately  us locations 
we also maintain an extensive network of over  complementary  alternative and physical medicine practitioners  which offers convenient access to the significant number of individuals who seek health services outside of the traditional healthcare system 
our guiding philosophy and approach to market is predicated on the fundamental belief that healthier people cost less and are more productive 
as described more fully below  our programs are designed to improve well being by helping people adopt or maintain healthy behaviors  reduce health related risk factors  and optimize their care for identified health conditions 
first  our programs are designed to help people adopt or maintain healthy behaviors by fostering wellness and disease prevention through total population screening  well being assessments and supportive interventions  and engaging people in health improvement programs  such as fitness  weight management  chiropractic  and complementary and alternative medicine 
our prevention programs focus on education  physical fitness  health coaching  and behavior change techniques and support 
we believe this approach improves the well being status of member populations and reduces the short and long term health related costs for participants  including associated costs from the loss of employee productivity 
second  our programs are designed to help people reduce health related risk factors by promoting personal change and improvement in the lifestyle behaviors that lead to poor health or chronic conditions  and providing educational materials and personal interactions with highly trained nurses and other healthcare professionals to create and sustain healthier behaviors for those individuals at risk or in the early stages of chronic conditions 
we enable our customers to engage everyone in their covered populations through specific interactions that are sensitive to each individual s health risks and needs 
our programs are designed to motivate people to make positive lifestyle changes and accomplish individual goals  such as increasing physical activity for seniors through the healthways silversneakers fitness solution  overcoming nicotine addiction through the quitnet on line smoking cessation community  or generating sustainable weight loss through our innergy solution 
finally  our programs are designed to help people optimize care for identified health conditions by incorporating the latest  evidence based clinical guidelines into interventions to optimize patient health outcomes  developing care support plans and motivating members to set attainable goals for themselves  providing local market resources to address acute episodic interventions  coordinating members care with their healthcare providers  providing software licensing and management consulting in support of well being improvement services  and providing high risk care management for members at risk for hospitalization due to complex conditions 
our approach is to use proprietary  analytic models to identify individuals who are likely to incur future high costs  including those who have specific gaps in care  and through evidence based interventions drive adherence to proven standards of care  medication regimens and physicians plans of care to reduce disease progression and related medical spending 
we recognize that each individual plays a variety of roles in his or her pursuit of improved well being  often simultaneously 
by providing the full spectrum of services to meet each individual s needs  we believe our interventions can be delivered at scale and in a manner that reflects those unique needs over time 
we believe that real and sustainable behavior change generates measurable  long term cost savings and improved individual and business performance

risk factors 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies we describe our accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding the estimates and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition our fees are generally billed on a per member per month pmpm basis or upon member participation 
for pmpm fees  we generally determine our contract fees by multiplying the contractually negotiated pmpm rate by the number of members covered by our services during the month 
we typically set pmpm rates during contract negotiations with customers based on the value we expect our programs to create and a sharing of that value between the customer and the company 
in addition  some of our services  such as the healthways silversneakers fitness solution  include fees that are based upon member participation 
our contracts with health plans and integrated healthcare systems generally range from three to five years with a number of comprehensive strategic agreements extending up to ten years in length 
contracts with self insured employers typically have two to four year terms 
some of our contracts allow the customer to terminate early 
some of our contracts place a portion of our fees at risk based on achieving certain performance metrics  cost savings  and or clinical outcomes improvements performance based 
approximately of revenues recorded during the year ended december  were performance based and were subject to final reconciliation as of december  we recognize revenue as follows we recognize the fixed portion of pmpm fees and fees for service as revenue during the period in which we perform our services  and we recognize performance based revenue based on the most recent assessment of our performance  which represents the amount that the customer would legally be obligated to pay if the contract were terminated as of the latest balance sheet date 
we generally bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due for the prior month s enrollment  which typically includes the amount  if any  that is performance based and may be subject to refund should we not meet performance targets 
fees for service are typically billed in the month after the services are provided 
deferred revenues arise from contracts that permit upfront billing and collection of fees covering the entire contractual service period  generally months 
a limited number of our contracts provide for certain performance based fees that we cannot bill until we reconcile them with the customer 
we generally assess our level of performance for our contracts based on medical claims and other data that the customer is contractually required to supply 
a minimum of four to nine months data is typically required for us to measure performance 
in assessing our performance  we may include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and a medical cost trend compared to a baseline year 
in addition  we may also provide contractual allowances for billing adjustments such as data reconciliation differences as appropriate 
if data is insufficient or incomplete to measure performance  or interim performance measures indicate that we are not meeting performance targets  we do not recognize performance based fees subject to refund as revenues but instead record them in a current liability account entitled contract billings in excess of earned revenue 
only in the event we do not meet performance levels by the end of the measurement period  typically one year  are we contractually obligated to refund some or all of the performance based fees 
we would only reverse revenues that we had already recognized if performance to date in the measurement period  previously above targeted levels  subsequently dropped below targeted levels 
historically  any such adjustments have been immaterial to our financial condition and results of operations 
during the settlement process under a contract  which generally occurs six to eight months after the end of a contract year  we settle any performance based fees and reconcile healthcare claims and clinical data 
as of december   cumulative performance based revenues that have not yet been settled with our customers but that have been recognized in the current and prior years totaled approximately million  all of which were based on actual data received from our customers 
of this amount  million was settled with customers after december   and million remains subject to final reconciliation 
data reconciliation differences  for which we provide contractual allowances until we reach agreement with respect to identified issues  can arise between the customer and us due to customer data deficiencies  omissions  and or data discrepancies 
performance related adjustments including any amounts recorded as revenue that were ultimately refunded  changes in estimates  or data reconciliation differences may cause us to recognize or reverse revenue in a current fiscal year that pertains to services provided during a prior fiscal year 
during  and  we recognized a net increase in revenue of million  million  and million that related to services provided prior to each respective year 
impairment of intangible assets and goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if we conclude during the qualitative assessment that this is the case  we perform a quantitative review as described below 
otherwise  we do not perform a quantitative review 
if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment  then we proceed to the quantitative review described below 
during a quantitative review of goodwill  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market based approach  and we reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our consolidated market capitalization 
estimating fair value requires significant judgments  including management s estimate of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term growth rate for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital  as well as relevant comparable company earnings multiples for the market based approach 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value and potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired based upon an impairment review  we calculate any impairment using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required by us gaap 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received upon a sale of the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
except for a trade name that has an indefinite life and is not subject to amortization  we amortize identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technologies and customer contracts  over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  we calculate any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we review intangible assets not subject to amortization  which consist of a trade name  on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we estimate the fair value of the trade name using a present value technique  which requires management s estimate of future revenues attributable to this trade name  estimation of the long term growth rate for these revenues  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value for the trade name 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and or other intangible assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
accounting for income taxes requires significant judgment in determining income tax provisions  including determination of deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities  and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets  and in evaluating tax positions 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
us gaap also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and expected stock option exercise behavior 
in addition  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
results of operations the following table sets forth the components of the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended december   and expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended december  revenues cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization included below selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization impairment loss restructuring and related charges operating income loss gain on sale of investment interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss figures may not add due to rounding 
revenues revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  over fiscal  primarily due to decreases in revenue from the wind down of our contract with cigna healthcare  inc cigna in advance of the contract s expiration in february  as well as certain other contract or program terminations with three smaller health plan customers 
these decreases were somewhat offset by the following the commencement of contracts with new customers  an increase in participation in our fitness solutions  as well as in the number of members eligible to participate in such solutions  and an increase in performance based revenues due to our ability to measure and achieve performance targets on certain contracts during the year ended december  revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  over fiscal  primarily due to the following the recognition of revenues in in connection with a final settlement with cms associated with our participation in two mhs programs  and contract and program terminations and restructurings with certain customers 
these decreases were somewhat offset by revenue from new and expanded contracts and an increase in participation in our fitness solutions  as well as in the number of members eligible to participate in such solutions 
cost of services cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for fiscal increased to compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following the wind down of our contract with cigna and certain other contract or program terminations with three smaller health plan customers to whom we provided traditional disease management services  all of which carried a lower than average cost of services as a percentage of revenues  increased costs related to the implementation of a significant number of new contracts and the launch of new business in the evolving health systems market  and an expanded and extended contract during the year ended december  which moved from a cost plus model to a volume based model in which revenues are expected to ramp over time  while the underlying cost structure remained consistent with the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by decreases in cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues due to the following an increase in performance based revenues wherein a significant portion of the related costs were incurred and recognized in a prior period  costs associated with implementing a new and innovative contract in for which we weren t able to recognize revenue until  and efficiencies gained in our fitness solutions through certain cost management initiatives 
cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for fiscal increased to compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following costs associated with implementing certain significant new and innovative contracts  an increase in implementation expenses primarily related to our embrace platform  an increased portion of our revenue generated by fitness solutions  which typically have a higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue than our other programs  changes in the contract structure of certain incentive based wellness programs from a utilization model to a pmpm model  as well as an increase in the number of members eligible for these programs and their utilization of such programs  and costs associated with an initiative to promote member participation in our fitness solutions 
these increases were somewhat offset by the following decreases in cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues a decrease in the level of short and long term performance based incentive compensation based on the company s financial performance against established internal targets for these periods  a decrease in salaries and benefits expense  primarily due to a restructuring of the company  which was completed during the fourth quarter of  and cost savings related to certain operational efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to certain cost reductions from a restructuring of the company in that was largely completed during the fourth quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following a decrease in the level of long term performance based incentive compensation during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   based on the company s financial performance against established internal targets for these periods  and cost savings realized during from a restructuring of the company that was largely completed during the fourth quarter of these decreases were somewhat offset by increased costs involved in pursuing business in evolving markets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased depreciation expense related to our embrace platform  partially offset by decreased amortization expense due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during depreciation and amortization expense decreased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily related to certain computer software that became fully depreciated during  slightly offset by increased depreciation expense resulting from the implementation of our embrace platform restructuring and related charges and impairment loss during fiscal  we incurred net charges of million related to a restructuring of the company in the fourth quarter of  which primarily consisted of termination benefits related to capacity realignment 
during fiscal  we incurred net charges of million related to a restructuring of the company in the fourth quarter of  which primarily consisted of termination benefits and costs associated with capacity reductions following cigna s decision to wind down its contract beginning in also during fiscal  we incurred charges of million primarily related to an impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of gain on sale of investment in january  a private company in which we held preferred stock was acquired by a third party 
during the second quarter of  we recognized a gain of million related to the receipt of a final escrow payment as a result of this sale 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal  primarily due to the write off of previously deferred loan costs as a result of entering into the fifth amended credit agreement in june interest expense for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in floating interest rates on outstanding borrowings during fiscal compared to fiscal income tax expense our effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december   primarily due to routine reconciliations of estimated amounts and the relatively small base of pretax income for in relation to certain unrecognized tax benefits and non deductible expenses 
in we had positive income tax expense of million despite a pre tax loss of million primarily due to an impairment loss of million  the majority of which was not deductible for tax purposes 
in our effective tax rate was 
outlook despite the loss of our contract with cigna and one other terminated health plan contract  we anticipate that revenues for will increase over primarily due to increased revenues from new and expanded contracts and from our fitness solutions 
we expect cost of services as a percentage of revenues for to increase slightly compared to primarily due to the wind down of our contract with cigna and one other terminated health plan contract  both of which carried a lower than average cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
in addition  we anticipate that  due to the nature of recent significant new and expanded contracts  costs on these contracts may be incurred before revenues are fully expressed 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for to decrease compared to primarily due to our ability to more effectively leverage our selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of expected growth in our operations 
we anticipate depreciation and amortization expense for will increase compared to primarily due to continued investment in our embrace platform 
we anticipate that quarterly revenues and net income loss will improve sequentially throughout as staged services and new contracts are implemented  as lives being served expand  and as performance based revenue is measured and recognized 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  a significant portion of our long term debt is subject to fixed interest rate swap agreements  however  we cannot predict the potential for changes in interest rates  which would impact our variable rate debt 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities for fiscal provided cash of million compared to million for fiscal the decrease in operating cash flow resulted primarily from the following a decrease in gross margins  an increase in days sales outstanding from days at december  to days at december   an increase in certain long term incentive and other benefit payments during  and an increase in severance payments in made as a result of a restructuring of the company that was largely completed during the fourth quarter of these decreases in operating cash flow were slightly offset by an increase in operating cash flow due to reduced tax payments in as compared to investing activities during fiscal used million in cash  which primarily consisted of capital expenditures associated with our embrace platform 
financing activities during fiscal provided million in cash primarily due to net borrowings under the fifth amended credit agreement 
on june   we entered into the fifth amended credit agreement 
the fifth amended credit agreement provides us with a million revolving credit facility that expires on june  and includes a swingline sub facility of million and a million sub facility for letters of credit 
the fifth amended credit agreement also provides a million term loan facility that matures on june   million of which remained outstanding on december   and an uncommitted incremental accordion facility of million 
as of december   availability under the revolving credit facility totaled million as calculated under the most restrictive covenant 
borrowings under the fifth amended credit agreement generally bear interest at variable rates based on a margin or spread in excess of either the one month  two month  three month or six month rate or with the approval of affected lenders  nine month or twelve month rate for eurodollar deposits libor or the greatest of a the suntrust bank prime lending rate  b the federal funds rate plus  and c one month libor plus the base rate  as selected by the company 
the libor margin varies between and  and the base rate margin varies between and  depending on our leverage ratio 
the fifth amended credit agreement also provides for an annual fee ranging between and of the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility 
extensions of credit under the fifth amended credit agreement are secured by guarantees from all of the company s active domestic subsidiaries and by security interests in substantially all of the company s and such subsidiaries assets 
we are required to repay outstanding revolving loans under the revolving credit facility on june  we are required to repay term loans in quarterly principal installments aggregating of the original aggregate principal amount of the term loans during each of the eight quarters beginning with the quarter ended september   of the original aggregate principal amount of the term loans during each of the next four quarters beginning with the quarter ending september   of the original aggregate principal amount of the term loans during each of the remaining quarters prior to maturity on june   at which time the entire unpaid principal balance of the term loans is due and payable 
the fifth amended credit agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios or levels of total funded debt to ebitda and fixed charge coverage 
the fifth amended credit agreement also limits repurchases of the company s common stock and the amount of dividends that the company can pay to holders of its common stock 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenant requirements of the fifth amended credit agreement 
the fifth amended credit agreement contains various other affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for financings of this type 
on february   we entered into a first amendment to the fifth amended credit agreement  which provided for  among other things  a temporary increase in the libor margin and base rate margin of through december   only in the event that our total funded debt to ebitda ratio is greater than or equal to 
in order to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our floating rate debt commitments  we maintain interest rate swap agreements that effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed obligations  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
under these agreements  we receive a variable rate of interest based on libor  and we pay a fixed rate of interest with interest rates ranging from to plus a spread 
we maintain interest rate swap agreements with current notional amounts of million and termination dates ranging from june  to december  of this amount  million was effective at december   million became effective in january  million will become effective in june  million will become effective in november  and million will become effective in  as older interest rate swap agreements expire 
we have designated these interest rate swap agreements as qualifying cash flow hedges 
we currently meet the hedge accounting criteria under us gaap in accounting for these interest rate swap agreements 
in october  our board authorized a share repurchase program  which allowed for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions through october  no shares were repurchased during pursuant to the program 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities  our available cash  and our anticipated available credit under the fifth amended credit agreement will continue to enable us to meet our contractual obligations and to fund our current operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if our operations require significant additional financing resources  such as capital expenditures for technology improvements  additional well being improvement call centers and or letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance to guarantee our performance under the terms of new contracts  or if we are required to refund performance based fees pursuant to contract terms  we may need to raise additional capital by expanding our existing credit facility and or issuing debt or equity securities 
if we face a limited ability to arrange such financing  it may restrict our ability to effectively operate our business 
we cannot assure you that we would always be able to secure additional financing if needed and  if such funds were available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us 
if contract development accelerates or acquisition opportunities arise  we may need to issue additional debt or equity securities to provide the funding for these increased growth opportunities 
we may also issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions or strategic alliances 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to issue additional debt or equity securities on terms that would be acceptable to us 
any material commitments for capital expenditures are included in the contractual obligations table below 
contractual obligations the following schedule summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by year ended december  in thousands and after total deferred compensation plan payments long term debt and related interest operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations outsourcing obligations other contractual cash obligations total contractual cash obligations consists of payments under a non qualified deferred compensation plan and performance cash awards 
consists of scheduled principal payments  repayment of outstanding revolving loans  and estimated interest payments on outstanding borrowings under the fifth amended credit agreement 
estimated interest payments are million for  million for and combined  and million for and combined 
excludes total sublease income of million 
consists of scheduled principal payments and estimated interest payments on capital lease obligations 
estimated interest payments are immaterial 
outsourcing obligations primarily include a ten year applications and technology services outsourcing agreement with hp enterprise services  llc entered into in may that contains minimum fee requirements 
total payments over the remaining term  including an estimate for future contractual cost of living adjustments  must equal or exceed a minimum level of approximately million  however  based on initial required service and equipment level assumptions  we estimate that the remaining payments will be approximately million 
the agreement allows us to terminate all or a portion of the services after the first two years provided we pay certain termination fees  which could be material to the company 
other contractual cash obligations primarily include million of severance payments  which are payable in  as well as a year strategic relationship agreement with gallup that we entered into in january and a year global joint venture agreement with gallup that we entered into in october we have minimum remaining contractual cash obligations of million related to these agreements  million of which will occur during   and  million which will occur in and and the remaining million of which will occur ratably over the following years 
we have excluded long term liabilities of million related to uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of these payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu no 
permits an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
if the entity concludes that this is the case  it must perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value 
otherwise  the quantitative impairment test is not required 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after september   with earlier adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  cash flows  or notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
which requires companies to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci by component 
in addition  entities are required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the accompanying notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  entities are required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail on those amounts 
asu no 
is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  cash flows  or notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk related to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of the fifth amended credit agreement 
borrowings under the fifth amended credit agreement generally bear interest at variable rates based on a margin or spread in excess of either one month  two month  three month or six month libor or with the approval of affected lenders  nine month or twelve month libor or the greatest of a the suntrust bank prime lending rate  b the federal funds rate plus  and c the base rate as previously defined  as selected by the company 
the libor margin varies between and  and the base rate margin varies between and  depending on our leverage ratio 
in order to reduce our interest rate exposure under the fifth amended credit agreement  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements effectively converting a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed obligations with interest rates ranging from to plus a spread
