item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
although we believe that we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies  including simulation analysis and the use of interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments  to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations  any substantial  unexpected and or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on us 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate 
our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the markets in which we operate 
we have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our branches are located the rocky mountains and northwest  the great lakes and the northeast as well as potential exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint 
for example  the nonowner occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate portfolio has exposures in markets outside of our footprint 
the delinquencies  nonperforming loans and charge offs that we have experienced since have been more heavily weighted to these specific markets 
real estate values and cash flows have been negatively affected on a national basis due to weak economic conditions 
certain markets  such as florida  southern california  phoenix  arizona  and las vegas  nevada  experienced more significant deterioration during the recession  while values have stabilized over the past year  they remain well below peak levels across markets 
the regional economic conditions in areas in which we conduct our business have an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources  and  in turn  may have a material adverse effect on us 
ii 
compliance risks we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision  which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the dodd frank act and other financial reform initiatives 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  the dif and the banking system as a whole  not our debtholders or shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy  ability to repurchase our common shares  and growth  among other things 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation  and or continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices  requirements or expectations  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes may subject us to additional compliance costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer  affect the investments we make and the manner in which we operate our businesses  increase our litigation and regulatory costs should we fail to appropriately comply with such laws  regulations or policies  and increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 
see supervision and regulation in item of this report for further information 
additionally  federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution affiliated parties 
these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
if we were the subject of an enforcement action  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
the regulatory environment for the financial services industry is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the united states  including the dodd frank act and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
the united states and other governments have undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry 
we have faced increased regulation of our industry  and will continue to face such regulation into  as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide economic stimulus  financial market stability  and enhancement of the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions 
we have also faced increased regulation as a result of new efforts designed to protect consumers and investors from financial abuse 
we also expect more intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels particularly due to both keybank s and keycorp s status as covered institutions for the enhanced prudential standards promulgated under the dodd frank act 
although many parts of the dodd frank act are now in effect  other parts are still in the implementation stage  which is likely to continue for several years 
accordingly  some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon key of the dodd frank act as fully implemented 
compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase our costs and reduce our revenue and may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities and to take certain types of corporate actions 
for more detailed information on the regulatory environment and the laws  rules and regulations that may affect us  see supervision and regulation in item of this report 
iii 
credit risks should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market further deteriorate  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector are improving but remain relatively weak  under continuing pressure by reduced asset values  high vacancies and reduced rents 
commercial real estate values peaked in the fall of according to moody s real estate analytics  llc commercial property index  commercial real estate values were down approximately from their peak as of november a portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans 
these properties are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan  but the borrower may be reliant upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments 
if we experienced weaknesses similar to those experienced at the height of the economic downturn  then we would experience a slowing in the execution of new leases  which may also lead to existing lease turnover 
the us economy remains highly vulnerable  and any reversal in broad macro trends would threaten the nascent recovery in commercial real estate 
the improvement of certain economic factors  such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents  has continued to lag behind the overall economy  or not occur at all 
these economic factors typically affect certain industries  such as real estate and financial services  more significantly 
to illustrate this point  improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by to months 
our clients include entities active in these industries 
furthermore  financial services companies with a substantial lending business  like ours  are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans 
should unemployment or real estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of time  or fundamentals deteriorate as a result of further decline in asset values and the instability of rental income  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
declining asset prices could adversely affect us 
during the recession from december to june  the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels 
the severe market dislocations in led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions  causing widespread liquidation of assets and further constraining of the credit markets 
these asset sales  along with asset sales by other leveraged investors  including some hedge funds  rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes 
asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet  and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable 
for example  a further recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on us 
various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase 
we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense  that represents our estimate of losses within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks incurred in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan and lease loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions  and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to  such as unemployment and real estate values  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses ie  if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate  we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses 
should such additional provisions become necessary  they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to credit risk  in the form of changes in interest rates  changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate  and or changes in the financial condition of our counterparties  which changes could adversely affect us 
there are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate 
increases in interest rates and or further weakening of economic conditions caused by another recession or otherwise could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial  financial and agricultural loans  commercial real estate loans  including commercial mortgage and construction loans  and commercial leases 
these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans 
we also do business with environmentally sensitive industries and in connection with the development of brownfield sites that provide appropriate business opportunities 
we monitor and evaluate our borrowers for compliance with environmental related covenants  which include covenants requiring compliance with applicable law 
should political or other changes make it difficult for certain of our customers to maintain compliance with applicable covenants  our credit quality could be adversely affected 
the deterioration of a larger loan or a group of our loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans  which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge offs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us 
additionally  in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse effect on us 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries  and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
financial services institutions  however  are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to  and may cause  market wide liquidity problems and losses 
many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on us 
iv 
capital and liquidity risks capital requirements imposed by the dodd frank act  together with new capital and liquidity standards adopted by the basel committee  will result in banks and bhcs needing to maintain more and higher quality capital than has historically been the case 
new and evolving capital standards  both as a result of the dodd frank act and the implementation of new capital standards adopted by the basel committee  including basel iii  will have a significant impact on banks and bhcs  including key 
for a detailed explanation of basel iii and possible revisions to current capital rules  see the sections titled supervision and regulation and capital 
the full effect of the federal reserve s possible revisions to the basel iii liquidity standards on key is uncertain at this time 
the need to maintain more and higher quality capital as well as greater liquidity going forward could limit our business activities  including lending  and our ability to expand  either organically or through acquisitions 
it could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders 
in addition  the new liquidity standards could require us to increase our holdings of highly liquid short term investments  thereby reducing our ability to invest in longer term assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective 
in addition  the federal reserve requires bank holding companies to obtain approval before making a capital distribution  such as paying or increasing dividends  implementing common stock repurchase programs  or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments 
the federal reserve has set forth the processes that bank holding companies should have in place to ensure they hold adequate capital under adverse conditions to maintain ready access to funding before engaging in any of these activities 
these rules could limit key s ability to make distributions  including paying out dividends or buying back shares 
see supervision and regulation in item of this report there can be no assurance that the legislation and other initiatives undertaken by the united states government will continue to support increased stability in the us financial system 
since  the federal government has intervened in an unprecedented manner in an effort to provide stability and liquidity to the financial markets 
the federal reserve is currently maintaining a variety of monetary policy measures to stabilize the economy  these policy measures have been maintained by the fomc over the last few years as economic growth  unemployment and inflation have not been at levels mandated for the fomc to achieve 
market liquidity issues have been alleviated somewhat  but us growth still lags levels mandated for the fomc to achieve  and the us economy remains vulnerable 
in addition  while the situation in europe has stabilized somewhat  the region s recession and ongoing fiscal challenges remain important risks to the us economy 
there can be no assurance regarding the actual impact that these government initiatives will have on the financial markets 
the failure of the us government programs to sufficiently contribute to financial market stability and put the us economy on a stable path for an economic recovery could result in a worsening of current financial market conditions  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in the event that any of the various forms of turmoil experienced in the financial markets return or become exacerbated  there may be a material adverse effect on us from i continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets  ii continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our transaction counterparties specifically  iii limitations resulting from further governmental action to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system  or iv further recessionary conditions 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our funds 
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries 
with the exception of cash raised from debt and equity issuances  we receive substantially all of our cash flow from dividends from our subsidiaries 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity securities and interest and principal on our debt 
federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that keybank keycorp s largest subsidiary can pay 
for further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by keybank  see supervision and regulation in item of this report 
in the event keybank is unable to pay dividends to us  we may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on our equity securities 
our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
the inability to receive dividends from keybank could have a material adverse effect on us 
our credit ratings affect our liquidity position 
our rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of keycorp and keybank  and their ratings of our long term debt and other securities are based on a number of factors  including our financial strength  ability to generate earnings  and other factors  some of which are not entirely within our control  such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy 
in light of the difficulties in the financial services industry  the financial markets and the economy  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings 
on october   s p maintained its positive outlook rating for each of keycorp and keybank 
s p s ratings for keycorp s short term borrowings and senior long term debt are a and bbb  respectively  and keybank s short term borrowings  senior long term debt and subordinated debt are rated a  a  and bbb  respectively 
in light of the various changes in the ratings methodologies underway as a result of the dodd frank act  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings 
if the securities of keycorp and or keybank suffer ratings downgrades  such downgrades could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds  trigger additional collateral or funding requirements  and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us  thereby reducing our ability to generate income 
downgrades of the credit ratings of securities  particularly if they are below investment grade  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to liquidity risk  which could negatively affect our funding levels 
market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding  affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  meet contractual obligations  and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 
although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions  any substantial  unexpected and or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on us 
certain credit markets that we participate in and rely upon as sources of funding were significantly disrupted and volatile from the third quarter of through the third quarter of credit markets have improved since then  and we have significantly reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources 
part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves promoting customer deposit growth  exiting certain noncore lending businesses  diversifying our funding base  maintaining a liquid asset portfolio  and strengthening our capital base to reduce our need for debt as a source of liquidity 
many of these disrupted markets have shown signs of recovery throughout nonetheless  if further market disruption or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness and or the availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged period of time  should our funding needs necessitate it  we may need to expand our use of other potential means of accessing funding and managing liquidity such as generating client deposits  securitizing or selling loans  extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings  purchasing deposits from other banks  borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities  and utilizing relationships developed with fixed income investors in a variety of markets  as well as increased management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other management tools 
there can be no assurance that these alternative means of funding will be available  under certain stressed conditions experienced in the liquidity crisis during  some of these alternative means of funding were not available 
should these forms of funding become unavailable  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
v 
operational risks we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including among others  our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives 
our strategic priorities include growing revenue and reducing expenses through targeted investments  technology enhancements and streamlining our operations 
as part of our efficiency initiative  we have committed to achieving an annual expense run rate reduction of to million by december and a cash efficiency ratio in the target range of to by the first quarter of there may be unanticipated difficulties in implementing our efficiency initiative  and there can be no assurance that we will ultimately realize the full benefits of  or be able to sustain the annual cost savings anticipated by  our efficiency initiative 
our inability to achieve the anticipated outcomes of our stated strategies may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability 
our strategic priorities also include developing  maintaining and building long term customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices 
our failure to execute our strategic initiatives relating to any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position and have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to operational risk 
we are subject to operational risk  which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error  inadequate or failed internal processes and systems  and external events 
operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees  clerical and record keeping errors  nonperformance by vendors  threats to cybersecurity  and computer telecommunications malfunctions 
operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk  which is the risk of loss from violations of  or noncompliance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices or ethical standards  as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations 
we are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements  and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business  such as certain loan processing functions 
for example  break downs or failures of our vendors systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us 
additionally  some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and  therefore  are subject to political risks unique to the regions in which they operate 
resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges  increased operational costs  harm to our reputation  inability to secure insurance  litigation  regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities  any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
we regularly review and update our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
we also maintain an erm program 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or a failure to establish appropriate controls or to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on us 
our methods of reducing risk exposure might not be effective 
instruments  systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance  credit  liquidity  operational and business risks and enterprise wide risk could be less effective than anticipated 
as a result  we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications  information systems both internal and provided by third parties and the internet to conduct our business 
our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal  regulatory and internal standards and specifications 
in addition  a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing  storage and transmission of personal and confidential information  such as the personal information of our customers and clients 
these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internet based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web based products and applications 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a possible failure  interruption or breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that such action will not occur or  if any does occur  that it will be adequately addressed 
for example  although we maintain commercially reasonable measures to ensure the cybersecurity of our information systems  other financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems 
in addition  several us financial institutions  including key  have recently experienced significant distributed denial of service attacks  some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems 
other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data  often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware  cyberattacks and other means 
to date  none of these efforts has had a material effect on our business or operations 
such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources  including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments 
those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees  customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients 
although we have adjusted our cybersecurity program to anticipate that a breach is more likely and have placed a greater focus on detection and incident response  our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks 
we are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information 
an interception  misuse or mishandling of personal  confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability  remediation costs  regulatory action and reputational harm 
we are also increasingly reliant on third party service providers to perform significant operational services on our behalf 
these third party providers are subject to the same risks relating to cybersecurity  break downs or failures of their own systems or employees 
while we make every effort to mitigate these risks through specific contractual obligations relating to security and strong oversight of these service providers  there can be no assurance that one or more of our third party service providers will not experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and  if any such event does occur  that it will be adequately addressed 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those of our third party service providers could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
these risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our offerings of mobile payments and other internet or web based products 
notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity  a disruptive event impacting the infrastructure that supports our business  such as a failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  could adversely affect our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to claims and litigation 
from time to time  customers  vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal actions against us 
we maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable  consistent with applicable accounting guidance 
at any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation 
resolution of a legal action can often take years 
whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
we are also involved  from time to time  in other reviews  investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding our business  including  among other things  accounting and operational matters  certain of which may result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions or other relief 
the number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the dodd frank act  the creation of the cfpb  and the uncertainty as to whether federal preemption of certain state consumer laws remains intact for federally chartered financial institutions like keybank and keycorp 
a weakening of federal pre emption would potentially increase our compliance and operational costs and risks since we are a national bank with multi state operations and customers and we would potentially face state and local enforcement activity 
there have also been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years  and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur 
it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
any financial liability for which we have not adequately maintained reserves  and or any damage to our reputation from such claims and legal actions  could have a material adverse effect on us 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
although we have established disaster recovery plans and procedures  and monitor for significant environmental effects on our properties or our investments  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on us 
vi 
strategic and reputation risks we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national and super regional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings associations  credit unions  mortgage banking companies  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  investment management firms  investment banking firms  broker dealers and other local  regional and national financial services firms 
in recent years  competition has intensified due to substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry  a trend that may continue 
the competitive landscape was also affected by the liquidity crisis  which led to the conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding companies due to the access it provides to government sponsored sources of liquidity 
in addition  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks 
we expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intensified as a result of legislative  regulatory  structural and technological changes 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among others  our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives  developing  maintaining and building long term customer relationships based on quality service  competitive prices  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  and industry and general economic trends 
increased competition in the financial services industry  and our failure to perform in any of these areas  could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability and have a material adverse effect on us 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense  and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want and or need 
to attract and retain qualified employees  we must compensate such employees at market levels 
typically  those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense 
various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the dodd frank act and other legislation and regulations 
in addition  our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by the federal reserve  which may identify deficiencies in the structure  causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals 
our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments  or any new executive compensation limits and regulations  and such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on us 
maintaining or increasing our market share may depend upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences  while maintaining competitive prices for our products and services 
the continuous  widespread adoption of new technologies  including internet services and smart phones  requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to adapt our products and services  as well as our distribution of them  to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences 
new technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks  while new services allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits 
the increasing pressure from our competitors  both bank and non bank  to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expenditures 
we may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services  modifying our existing products and services  adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits  achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval  sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors 
these risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest margin and fee based products and services  all factors which may have a material adverse effect on us 
our failure to effectively cross sell our products and services to customers could have a negative effect on our revenue growth and financial results 
selling more products or services to our customers  or cross selling  is an integral part of our business model and is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings during the current period of slow economic growth and regulatory reform 
many of our competitors also focus on cross selling  especially in retail banking and mortgage lending 
this can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us to sell our products at lower prices  reducing our net interest income and revenue from our fee based products 
it could also affect our ability to retain our existing customers 
as our competitors increase their cross selling efforts and new technologies require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers  we may face difficulties in increasing our cross selling ratio  or the average number of products sold to existing customers 
our failure to sell additional products or services to our existing or new customers who instead purchase such products from our competitors could have a material adverse effect on us 
damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses 
our ability to attract and retain customers  clients  investors and highly skilled management and employees is impacted by our reputation 
public perception of the financial services industry declined since the recent downturn in the us economy 
we continue to face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn 
significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources  including employee misconduct  actual or perceived unethical behavior  litigation or regulatory outcomes  failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality  compliance failures  disclosure of confidential information  and the activities of our clients  customers and counterparties  including vendors 
actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry can also significantly adversely affect our reputation 
we could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest 
management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions  obligations and interests with and among our clients 
the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us  which could adversely affect our businesses 
our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues gives rise to reputational risk that could cause significant harm to us and our business prospects  and may have a material adverse effect on us 
potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company  difficulty in estimating the value ie  the assets and liabilities of the target company  difficulty in estimating the fair value of acquired assets  liabilities and derivatives of the target company  and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company 
we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  failure to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on us 
vii 
risks to our common shares an investment in our common shares is not an insured deposit 
our common shares are not a bank deposit and  therefore  are not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common shares in any company 
as a result  if you acquire our common shares  you may lose some or all of your investment 
our articles of incorporation and regulations  as well as certain banking laws  may have an anti takeover effect 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and federal banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders 
the combination of these provisions may inhibit a non negotiated merger or other business combination  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

european sovereign debt exposure throughout the notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we use certain acronyms and abbreviations 
these terms are defined in note summary of significant accounting policies which begins on page introduction this section generally reviews the financial condition and results of operations of keycorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years 
some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth 
when you read this discussion  you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report 
the page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents 
terminology throughout this discussion  references to key  we  our  us and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of keycorp and its subsidiaries 
keycorp refers solely to the parent holding company  and keybank refers to keycorp s subsidiary bank  keybank national association 
we want to explain some industry specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows 
we use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business and austin 
results for the education lending business and austin have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations 
these portfolios  which are in a run off mode  stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy 
these exit loan portfolios are included in other segments 
we engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our key corporate bank segment 
these activities encompass a variety of products and services 
among other things  we trade securities as a dealer  enter into derivative contracts both to accommodate clients financing needs and to mitigate certain risks  and conduct transactions in foreign currencies both to accommodate clients needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates 
for regulatory purposes  capital is divided into two classes 
federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one half of a bank or bank holding company s total risk based capital must qualify as tier capital 
both total and tier capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy  which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition 
as described in the section entitled supervision and regulation under item business of this report  the regulators are required to conduct a supervisory capital assessment of all bhcs with assets of at least billion  including keycorp 
as part of this capital adequacy review  banking regulators evaluate a component of tier capital  known as tier common equity 
the section entitled capital under item business provides more information on total capital  tier capital and tier common equity and describes how the three measures are calculated

f this figure has been revised from what has previously been disclosed in our earnings release on january  economic overview the economy continued to tread water in  with overall gdp and payroll growth remaining modest and in line with and levels 
the quarterly flow of data also followed a similar pattern as that of the prior two years  with a relatively solid start  mid year slump  and modest recovery by year end 
in both and  slowing growth in the middle of the year was largely due to a series of external shocks the sovereign debt crisis and bp oil spill in  and the arab spring and japanese tsunami in the recovery was further challenged in by the debt ceiling debate and subsequent credit rating downgrade 
in  the story was less about shocks and more about constant  and at times strengthening  headwinds 
once again  the economy had a strong start  but paused heading into the summer as the debt crisis and renewed recession in europe  along with slowing growth in the emerging markets  grabbed headlines and sapped export demand 
in addition to these global concerns  rising political and policy uncertainty in the us led to a sharp pullback in business investment 
central banks around the world  including the fed and the european central bank  came to the rescue with a range of policy tools  which stabilized financial markets and set the stage for a moderate uptick in growth in the second half of the year 
the s p equity index managed to avoid a major market correction and ended the year up  compared to relatively no change during for the year  million new jobs were added  up from the total of million jobs added 
the unemployment rate fell further  from to 
while job growth was a factor  improvement in this measure was also driven by a steady decline in the participation rate  which stood at a year low at year end 
with substantial labor market slack remaining  wage growth deteriorated through much of the year and income growth was weak 
consumer spending  meanwhile  held up reasonably well  resulting in a falling savings rate 
a slowing rate of inflation supported incomes  and therefore spending  through the first half of the year  but shifted to a drag at mid year due to a sharp rise in energy prices 
by year end  inflation fell again as energy prices retreated  with headline cpi of just in december of compared to one year earlier 
core inflation also moderated through the year  ending at down from in 
the housing market shifted from a drag to a boost in  with solid improvement in nearly all metrics 
with the economy continuing its modest expansion  and home prices appearing to stabilize  demand for for sale housing posted steady gains 
sales of existing homes rose to an annualized pace of million in december  down slightly from the previous month  but up from new home sales also improved  reaching a pace of  as with existing homes  sales were down month over month  but up over levels 
as the share of distressed transactions fell  prices stabilized in the first half of the year and registered consistent gains in the second half  with the median price for existing homes up year over year in december housing starts accelerated further  up over the prior year s pace  driven by substantial gains in both multifamily and single family construction 
the federal reserve remained active and accommodative in  keeping the federal funds target rate near zero  expanding their balance sheet further  and making significant changes to their communications 
after remaining on hold in the first half of the year  the fed announced additional policy actions in june as growth deteriorated 
at that time  operation twist  the federal reserve s process of buying and selling short and long term bonds  was extended through year end 
in september  the fed announced a third round of quantitative easing  with billion in mortgage backed securities purchased each month 
importantly  the fed left the program open ended both in quantity and time 
also in september  the fed extended their federal funds interest rate guidance to mid in november  the fed capped a busy year with additional asset purchases and the adoption of numerical thresholds 
based on these thresholds  the federal funds rate will be kept near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above percent and the inflation forecast remains below percent 
the movement in rates through the year partially reflected fed actions  but also clearly tracked the economy and perception of risk 
looking at the year us treasury  the yield moved from at the beginning of the year  approached in march as the economy appeared to take off and fed commentary turned more hawkish  and then fell below in july as the economy stumbled and the european debt crisis reignited 
as europe stabilized and economic data improved  the year yield moved higher  ending the year at  even as fed accommodation grew 
long term financial goals our long term financial goals are as follows target a loan to core deposit ratio range of to  return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge off ratio range of

we will work closely with our board of directors and regulators to manage capital to support our clients needs and create shareholder value 
our capital remains a competitive advantage for us in both the intermediate and long term 
strategic developments we initiated the following actions during and to support our corporate strategy we continued to show solid profitability in the results for were primarily due to loan growth  continued repricing of our interest bearing liabilities to from current market rates  additional payment capabilities in the form of credit cards and improved mobile banking  and moving forward with our efficiency initiative  as our leadership team continues our strategy of focused execution 
on july   we completed our acquisition of retail branches in western new york  adding approximately billion in assets and deposits 
on september   associated with this acquisition we acquired approximately million of credit card receivables 
this acquisition provides an opportunity to utilize our existing cost structure across a larger base 
on august   approximately million in key branded credit card assets were acquired from elan financial services as part of our strategy to diversify our revenue stream and to provide opportunities for future growth 
we committed to lend billion to small and medium sized businesses by the end of we began this program in september of  and we have already met our goal well ahead of our pledge 
during  we continued to benefit from improved asset quality 
from one year ago  nonperforming loans declined by million to million  and nonperforming assets decreased by million to million 
net loan charge offs during declined to million  or 
of average loan balances  compared to million  or of average loan balances during during  we took advantage of the low interest rate environment and nontaxable treatment of gains pursuant to a previous settlement with the irs through the early termination of leveraged leases 
these terminations resulted in gains in noninterest income of million  offset by million in net interest income write offs of fees and capitalized loan origination costs 
we made progress on our previously announced efficiency initiative goal during we are committed to achieving an expense run rate reduction of to million by december  of which million annualized was achieved during for the year ended december   our cash efficiency ratio was 
using our current levels of revenue and expense  these initiatives are intended to move us toward our cash efficiency ratio target range of to by the first quarter of on july   we redeemed trust preferred securities issued by keycorp capital vii and keycorp capital x totaling approximately million 
during  we continued our commitment to disciplined capital management 
the repurchase program was also included in our capital plan submitted to the federal reserve as part of ccar and not objected to by the federal reserve 
with the repurchases completed through december   we have remaining authority to repurchase up to million of our common shares for general repurchase and repurchases in connection with employee elections under our compensation and benefit programs 
our existing repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
common share repurchases under the current authorization are expected to be executed through the first quarter of at december   our capital ratios remained strong with a tier common equity ratio of  our loan loss reserves were adequate at to period end loans and we were core funded with a loan to deposit ratio of 
our strong capital position provides us with the flexibility to support our clients and our business needs and to evaluate other appropriate capital deployment opportunities 
in may  our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend and declared a quarterly cash dividend of

on an annualized basis in accordance with our capital plan 
we were recognized in a survey by american customer satisfaction index  published in december of  for exceeding bank industry averages in measures such as customer expectations  customer satisfaction  customer loyalty  and overall quality

in  our full year result reflects success in executing our strategies to grow loans  add payment capabilities to our product line in the form of credits cards and improved mobile banking  and moving forward on our efficiency initiative 
our efficiency initiative ended with annual run rate savings of approximately million 
we continue to invest in the future revenue growth of our company by upgrading our technology to meet the needs of our clients 
we remain committed to delivering on our goal of achieving a cash efficiency ratio in the range of to as we enter the net interest margin from continuing operations was for this was an increase of five basis points from this increase was primarily attributable to lower funding costs and increased loan fees 
we continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher cost certificates of deposit and growing lower cost transaction accounts 
our current expectation  assuming the policy of low interest rates by the federal reserve continues  is for the net interest margin to be in the range for the first quarter of and for continued downward pressure in the one to three basis point range per quarter thereafter during average total loans increased billion  or during compared to the average balances of commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased from billion to billion  or approximately which led our year over year average loan growth 
we have continued to have success in growing our commercial loan portfolio by acquiring new clients in our focus industries as well as expanding existing relationships 
for  we anticipate average total loans to grow in the mid to upper single digit range  continuing to be led by growth in our commercial and industrial loans 
we originated new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses of approximately billion during  compared to approximately billion in our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was at december   compared to at december  our trend of improving the mix of deposits continued during as we experienced a billion or increase in non time deposits 
approximately billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at december   with a average cost are scheduled to mature over the next twelve months 
the maturation of these certificates of deposit and other liability repricing opportunities will continue help to offset repricing pressure on our assets 
this improved funding mix reduced the cost of interest bearing deposits  during compared to our asset quality statistics continued to improve during net charge offs declined to million  or 
of average loan balances for  compared to million  or for in addition  our nonperforming loans declined to million  or of period end loans at december   compared to million  or at december  our allowance for loan losses stood at million  or of period end loans  compared to billion  or at december   and represented and coverage of nonperforming loans at december   and december   respectively 
information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled credit risk management 
our expectation for net charge offs and provision expense during is to remain within our long term targeted range of to basis points 
our tangible common equity ratio and tier common ratio both remain strong at december   at and respectively  as compared to and at december  these ratios have placed us in the top quartile of our peer group for these measures 
we have identified four primary uses of capital 
the first is investing in our businesses  supporting our clients and our loan growth 
second is maintaining or increasing our common stock dividend 
third is to return capital in the form of share repurchase to our shareholders 
fourth is to be disciplined and opportunistic about how we invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitions over time 
our capital management remains focused on value creation 
to that end  in  we returned approximately of our net income to shareholders through both common share repurchases and dividends 
we also used our capital to acquire market share in western new york and to develop new revenue streams in the credit card and payment systems businesses 
the federal reserve is currently conducting a review of our capital plan under the ccar process 
until such time as they have completed their review and have no objection to our plan  we are not permitted to take any further actions to implement our plan for quarters subsequent to the first quarter of for the ccar process  the federal reserve has advised that it will provide us  and each bhc subject to ccar  with the initial results of the federal reserve s post stress capital analysis on march  we will then have the opportunity to make a one time downward adjustment to our capital plan  if necessary  before the federal reserve renders its final public objection or no objection decision 
in the event the federal reserve would  in whole or in part  object to our plan in its final public decision  we may submit a request for reconsideration of our plan within days  which the federal reserve is required to respond to within days 
in such circumstances  absent receipt of a no objection following a request for reconsideration  we would be required to re submit our plan within days 
upon receipt of a re submitted capital plan  the federal reserve has days to notify the bhc of its objection or no objection 
should we receive an objection  it would likely delay any actions on capital management until later in the calendar year 
we continue to look for opportunities to rationalize and optimize our existing branch network 
in  our focus related to our branch network shifted more toward relocations and consolidations to reposition our branch footprint into more attractive markets 
during  we closed underperforming branches as part of our plan 
another to branch closures are planned for  with the majority of these closures planned for the second quarter of figure presents certain non gaap financial measures related to tangible common equity  return on tangible common equity and tier common equity 
tier common equity  a non gaap financial measure  is a component of tier risk based capital 
tier common equity is not formally defined by gaap or prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations 
however  since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and tier common equity  we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases 
figure also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding non gaap measures 
traditionally  the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital  the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations 
since early  the federal reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier common equity 
because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders equity essentially tier risk based capital less preferred stock  qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier risk based capital  this focus on tier common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories 
the basel committee s final basel iii framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation  which us regulators propose to implement in the near future  also makes tier common equity a priority 
finally  the enactment of the dodd frank act also changed the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier eligible capital 
at the end of a three year phase out period that commenced on january   our trust preferred securities will be treated only as tier capital 
the supervision and regulation section in item business of this report contains more information about these regulatory initiatives 
the table also shows the computation for pre provision net revenue  which is not formally defined by gaap 
management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our ability to absorb loan losses by presenting our results on a more comparable basis  period to period 
the cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation 
management believes this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks 
additionally  this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis 
non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited

results of operations net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loan related fee income  and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings 
there are several factors that affect net interest income  including the volume  pricing  mix and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the volume and value of net free funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits and equity capital  the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk  interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace  and asset quality 
to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable  some not  we present net interest income in this discussion on a taxable equivalent basis ie  as if it were all taxable and at the same taxable rate 
for example  of tax exempt income would be presented as  an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of would yield figure shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense  and their respective yields or rates over the past six years 
this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years 
the net interest margin  which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding  is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 
taxable equivalent net interest income for was billion  and the net interest margin was 
these results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of billion and a net interest margin of for the prior year 
total net interest income remained flat compared to the prior year as a reduction in interest income on earning assets was offset by interest expense savings on deposits and borrowings 
the decrease in interest income is primarily attributable to a lower level and change in mix of average earning assets  resulting from pay downs on higher yielding loans and investments 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to continued improvement in the mix of deposits through the maturity of higher costing certificates of deposit and the growth of low cost non time and noninterest bearing deposit balances 
we also have benefitted from a reduction of long term debt 
average earning assets for totaled billion  which was billion  or  lower than the level 
the reduction reflects a billion reduction in our investments portfolio as securities were only partially reinvested to accommodate loan growth of billion and debt maturities and redemptions

also shown in figure  at december   of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner occupied properties  compared to at december  approximately and of these loans were construction loans at december   and  respectively 
typically  these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan 
the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the construction loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments 
a significant decline in economic growth  and in turn  in rental rates and occupancy  would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans

this compares to a decrease of million during since december   our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately million  or  as many of our clients have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates 
if the economic recovery stalls  it may weaken the commercial real estate market fundamentals ie  vacancy rates  the stability of rental income and asset values  leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments 
reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments 
accordingly  the value of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected 
commercial lease financing 
we conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our key equipment finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business 
commercial lease financing receivables represented of commercial loans at december   and at december  commercial loan modification and restructuring we modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients 
loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower 
in many cases  borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital  collateral  guarantees or income sources 
modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients financing needs 
modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  a loan is classified as a tdr only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 
our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions  forgiveness of principal  and other modifications 
loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types 
because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower  certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performanced under the restructured loan terms over the past year 
if the loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements  we transfer the loans to the asset recovery group for resolution 
during  there were million of new restructured loans  of which million related to commercial loans and million to consumer loans 
for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs  see note asset quality 
figure quantifies restructured loans and tdrs 
as of december   million of secured loans discharged through chapter bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower were reclassified as consumer tdrs 
regardless of delinquency status  these loans were accounted for at the fair market value of the collateral less selling costs  are classified as nonaccrual  and are included in nonperforming loans 
figure commercial tdrs by note type and accrual status december  in millions commercial tdrs by note type tranche a tranche b total commercial tdrs commercial tdrs by accrual status nonaccruing accruing held for sale total commercial tdrs total commercial and consumer tdrs we use an a b note structure for our tdrs  breaking the existing loan into two tranches 
first  we create an a note 
as the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well rated a note  we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards 
this note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest  and principal amortization of generally not more than years 
these metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long term markets and take out underwriting standards of our various lines of business 
appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status  allowing us to resume recognizing interest income 
as the borrower s payment performance improves  these restructured notes typically also allow for upgraded internal quality risk rating classification 
moreover  the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral typically  commercial real estate  the borrower s capital structure is strengthened often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction  and local markets are spared distressed fire sales 
the b note typically is an interest only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow 
this excess cash flow customarily is applied directly to the principal of the a note 
we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status 
in many cases  the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status 
alternatively  both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive 
restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current  well documented evaluation of the credit  which would include analysis of the borrower s financial condition  prospects for repayment under the modified terms  and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral 
we wait a reasonable period generally a minimum of six months to establish the borrower s ability to sustain historical repayment performance before returning the loan to accrual status 
sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account 
the primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid 
although our policy is a guideline  considerable judgment is required to review each borrower s circumstances 
all loans processed as tdrs  including a notes and any non charged off b notes  are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place 
extensions 
project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity  but sometimes they are modified and extended 
extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship  the status of the project  and near term prospects for both the client and the collateral 
in all cases  pricing and loan structure are reviewed and  where necessary  modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk 
typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal paydown  increased amortization  additional collateral  increased guarantees  and a cash flow sweep 
some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in  in those cases  pricing and loan terms cannot be altered 
loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor  if any 
therefore  pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market 
we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs  particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made 
in the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made  we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr 
extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 
guarantors 
we conduct a detailed guarantor analysis for all new extensions of credit  at the time of any material modification extension  and typically annually  as part of our on going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures 
this analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements  including balance sheets  income statements  tax returns  and real estate schedules 
while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary  the high level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities  including size  quality  and nature of asset base  net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value  leverage  standing liquidity  recurring cash flow  contingent and direct debt obligations  and near term debt maturities 
borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within days of the calendar fiscal year end 
income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly 
we may require certain information  such as liquidity  certifications  status of asset sales or debt resolutions  and real estate schedules to be provided more frequently 
we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent 
we may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor s verified financial condition 
we often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss  cost and the expense of collections 
as of december   we had million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than  and were accounted for as performing loans 
these loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors i underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization  ii a satisfactory borrower payment history  and iii acceptable guarantor support 
consumer loan portfolio consumer loans outstanding increased by billion  or  from one year ago 
the home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio 
approximately of this portfolio at december   is derived from our key community bank 
the remainder of the portfolio  which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of  was originated from the consumer finance line of business and is now included in other segments 
home equity loans in key community bank increased by million  or  over the past twelve months as a result of stabilized home values  improved employment  and favorable borrowing conditions 
as shown in figure  we hold the first lien position for approximately of the key community bank home equity portfolio at december   and at december  for consumer loans with real estate collateral  we track borrower performance monthly 
regardless of the lien position  credit metrics are refreshed quarterly  including recent fair isaac corporation scores as well as original and updated loan to value ratio 
this information is used in establishing the alll 
our methodology is described in note summary of significant accounting policies 
regulatory guidance issued in january addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans 
at december   of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages 
during the second quarter of  approximately billion of second lien home equity loans were reviewed by a third party service to determine the payment status of the associated first lien 
the resulting data identified approximately million of second lien home equity loans with an associated first lien that is either days or more past due or in foreclosure  or for which the first mortgage delinquency timeframe is unknown 
in accordance with the above mentioned regulatory guidance  these loans were classified as nonperforming in the second quarter of the classification of these identified second liens as nonperforming loans did not have an impact on the alll during the second quarter of or subsequent quarters because  as noted above  we have previously considered the risk characteristics of this portfolio of loans in our loss estimation methodology 
on at least a quarterly basis  we will continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate 
this regulatory guidance related to the classification of second lien home equity loans was implemented prospectively  and therefore prior periods were not adjusted 
in conjunction with the updated regulatory guidance that was issued in the third quarter of  at december   home equity loans include million of performing secured loans that were discharged through chapter bankruptcy and not formally re affirmed

all of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at december  our capital and liquidity are intended to position us well to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients needs  as well as to adjust to the regulations currently being proposed by the federal banking agencies to implement basel iii and provisions of the dodd frank act 
our shareholders equity to assets ratio was at december   compared to at december  our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was at december   compared to at december  banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bhcs and their banking subsidiaries 
risk based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of risk weighted assets 
risk weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off balance sheet and market risk items  subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors 
currently  banks and bhcs must maintain  at a minimum  tier capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of and total capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of 
as of december   our tier risk based capital ratio and our total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december  another indicator of capital adequacy  the leverage ratio  is defined as tier capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets 
bhcs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve s risk adjusted measure for market risk as we have must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 
as of december   our leverage ratio was  compared to at december  the enactment of the dodd frank act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bhcs by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible tier capital 
the three year phase out period  which commenced january   will ultimately result in our trust preferred securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts being treated only as tier capital 
these changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to bhcs  savings and loan holding companies  and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important

federal bank regulators group fdic insured depository institutions into five categories  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
a well capitalized institution must meet or exceed the prescribed threshold ratios of for tier risk based capital  for tier leverage capital  and for total risk based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement  order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
if these provisions applied to bhcs  we believe we would qualify as well capitalized at december   and we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause a change in capital category 
analysis on an estimated basis  accounting for the phase out of our trust preferred securities as tier eligible and therefore as tier instead as of december   also determines that we would qualify as well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines basel i  with the estimated tier risk based capital ratio  estimated leverage ratio  and estimated total risk based capital ratio being   and  respectively 
the revised prompt corrective action standards table in the supervision and regulation section in part business of this report discloses the proposed new threshold capital ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution 
the regulatory defined capital categories serve a limited supervisory function 
investors should not use our estimated ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp 
a discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in item business in the supervision and regulation section of this report under the heading capital 
traditionally  the banking regulators have assessed bank and bhc capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital  the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations 
as a result of the financial crisis  the federal reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier risk based capital  known as tier common equity  and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies  including keycorp 
the capital modifications mandated by the dodd frank act and set forth in basel iii  which the federal banking agencies have recently proposed to implement  are consistent with the renewed focus on tier common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks  bhcs  and covered nonbank financial companies  which resulted from the financial crisis 
tier common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations  this measure is considered to be a non gaap financial measure

our tier common equity ratio was at december   compared to at december  generally  for risk based capital purposes  deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on its projected future taxable income for the year  or ii of the amount of an institution s tier capital 
as we anticipated  at december   and december   we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from tier capital and risk weighted assets 
at december   for key s consolidated operations  we had a federal net deferred tax asset of million and a state deferred tax liability of million compared to a federal deferred tax asset of million and a state deferred tax liability of million at december  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards 
basel iii a detailed discussion of current rulemaking underway in the us to implement basel iii is in the supervision and regulation section in item business of this report 
the new minimum capital requirements table in the supervision and regulation section discloses the proposed new minimum capital ratios together with the estimated capital ratios of key at december   calculated on a fully phased in basis under the basel iii and standardized approach nprs 
given our strong capital position  we expect to be able to satisfy the basel iii capital framework when us capital regulations corresponding to it are finalized 
while we also have a strong liquidity position  the basel iii liquidity framework could require us and other us banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives  including adding additional liquid assets  issuing term debt  and modifying our product pricing for loans  commitments  and deposits

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we are party to various types of off balance sheet arrangements  which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 
variable interest entities a vie is a partnership  limited liability company  trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria the entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party 
the entity s investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the entity s equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns 
the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity  and substantially all of the entity s activities involve  or are conducted on behalf of  investors with disproportionately few voting rights 
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations  we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity  ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie  we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading basis of presentation and in note variable interest entities 
we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity s operating and financing decisions usually defined as a voting or economic interest of to  but not controlling 
unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than generally are carried at cost 
investments held by our registered broker dealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 
commitments to extend credit or funding loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria 
these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments 
since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized  the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay 
further information about our loan commitments at december   is presented in note commitments  contingent liabilities and guarantees under the heading commitments to extend credit or funding 
figure shows the remaining contractual amount of each class of commitment to extend credit or funding

risk management overview like all financial services companies  we engage in business activities and assume the related risks 
the most significant risks we face are credit  liquidity  market  compliance  operational  strategic  and reputation risks 
our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify  measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability 
certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 
the keycorp board of directors serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that key s risks are managed in a manner that is effective  balanced and adds value for the shareholders 
the keycorp board of directors understands key s risk philosophy  approves the risk appetite  inquires about risk practices  reviews the portfolio of risks  compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks  both actual and emerging  and determines whether management is responding appropriately 
the board challenges management and ensures accountability 
the keycorp audit committee assists the board in oversight of financial statement integrity  regulatory and legal compliance  independent auditors qualifications and independence and all risk review functions including internal audit 
the audit committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance 
the audit committee has responsibility over financial reporting  compliance risk and legal matters  the implementation  management and evaluation of operational risk controls and information  security and fraud risk  and associated reputation and strategic risks 
the keycorp risk committee assists the board in oversight of strategies  policies  procedures and practices relating to the management of credit risk  market risk  interest rate risk  and liquidity risk  including the actions taken to mitigate these risks  as well as reputational and strategic risks 
the risk committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital  reviews the enterprise risk management erm reports  and approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee 
the audit and risk committees meet jointly  as appropriate  to discuss matters that relate to each committee s responsibilities 
in addition to regularly scheduled bi monthly meetings  the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases 
committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting 
all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 
our erm committee  chaired by the chief executive officer and comprising other senior level executives  is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite 
the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy  policy  framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company 
the erm committee reports to the risk committee of our board of directors 
annually  the board of directors reviews and approves the erm program  as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories 
we use a risk adjusted capital framework to manage risks 
this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 
tier risk governance committees support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends  escalating emerging risks and discussing forward looking assessments 
membership of the risk governance committees includes representatives from each of the three lines of defense 
the first line of defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept  own  proactively identify  monitor and manage risk 
the second line of defense comprises risk management representatives who provide independent  centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating  analyzing and reporting risk information 
risk review provides the third line of defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness  appropriateness and adherence to keycorp s risk management policies  practices and controls 
the chief risk officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions  ensures appropriate ownership of risks  provides input into performance and compensation decisions  assesses aggregate enterprise risk  monitors capabilities to manage critical risks  and executes appropriate board and stakeholder reporting 
federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution 
we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks  and comport with regulatory expectations 
market risk management the cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market rates or prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices  credit spreads  volatilities or equity prices 
these factors influence prospective yields  values  or prices associated with the instrument 
for example  the value of a fixed rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase  while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase 
the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors 
interest rate risk management most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk  which is inherent in the banking industry  is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve 
such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite  and within board approved policy limits 
interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products  economic conditions  the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging  investing  funding and capital positions 
the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and option risk 
gap risk is the exposure to changes in interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest bearing liabilities and the volume of interest earning assets they fund for example  deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities reprice at the same time  but in response to different market factors or indexes 
yield curve risk is the exposure to non parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interest bearing liabilities and the interest earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve 
option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterparty s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets  liabilities or off balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty 
option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or early prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation 
net interest income simulation analysis 
the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and off balance sheet positions  accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity 
the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments  including a most likely macro economic scenario 
simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite 
typically  the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by basis points over the next twelve months  and term rates were to move in a similar fashion 
in light of the low interest rate environment  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months 
after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes  we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment 
we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments 
one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures 
assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve  including a sustained flat yield curve  an inverted slope yield curve  changes in credit spreads  an immediate parallel change in market interest rates  and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates 
another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures 
assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities  changes in lending spreads  prepayments on loans and securities  other loan and deposit balance shifts  investment  funding and hedging activities  and liquidity and capital management strategies 
simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model 
we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled  and validate those assumptions on a regular basis 
our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and off balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile 
however  actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition  customer behavior  product pricing  market interest rates  investment  funding and hedging activities  and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 
figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at december   and at december   our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive 
alco policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 
as shown in figure  we are operating within these limits 
figure simulated change in net interest income december  basis point change assumption short term rates alco policy limits interest rate risk assessment december  basis point change assumption short term rates alco policy limits interest rate risk assessment the fomc has indicated it anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late we continued to execute investment and hedging activities to migrate toward a more modest asset sensitive position 
hedging activities reflect the changes in the growth  mix  and maturity of customer deposits 
our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume  mix  maturity  and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows 
as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy  management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile 
the results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished  and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in figure net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing  magnitude  frequency  and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit repricing relationships  lending spreads  and the balance behavior of transaction accounts 
we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three year horizon 
these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve month horizon 
to capture longer term exposures  we calculate exposures to changes to the eve as discussed in the following section 
economic value of equity modeling 
eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve  twenty four and thirty six month horizons 
eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates 
eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  measuring the resulting change in the values of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and comparing those amounts with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment 
because the calculation of eve under an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points  we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate basis point decrease 
this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities 
those assumptions are based on historical behaviors  as well as our expectations 
we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
we are operating within these guidelines 
management of interest rate exposure 
we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate a lm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures 
specifically  we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities  issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates  and using derivatives predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps  which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 
figure shows all swap positions that we hold for a lm purposes 
these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed upon amounts of assets and liabilities ie  notional amounts to another interest rate index 
for example  fixed rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixed pay variable interest rate swap 
the volume  maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader a lm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged

b excludes accrued interest of million and million for december   and  respectively 
management of other market risks key also incurs market risk as a result of trading  investing and client facilitation activities  principally within our investment banking and capital markets lines of business 
key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates  and commodity prices  as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads 
our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these products 
we maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow  make markets in securities  and hedge certain risks 
the majority of our positions are traded in active markets 
we use a statistical technique known as var as one of the tools to measure  monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios 
we use a var simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  and credit spreads on the fair value of our trading portfolios 
our market risk management group calculates and distributes daily var based measurements to management in various lines of business 
using two years of historical information  the model estimates the maximum potential one day loss with a confidence level 
statistically  this means that losses will exceed var  on average  five out of trading days  or three to four times each quarter 
we perform back testing procedures to evaluate the accuracy of our var model and continue to enhance the modeling techniques and inputs and assumptions used to ensure proper measurement and monitoring of market risks 
we manage exposure to market risk in accordance with var limits for trading activity that have been approved by our market risk committee as part of our erm program 
at december   the aggregate one day trading limit set by the committee was million for all trading portfolios 
we are operating within these constraints 
during  our aggregate period end  daily average  minimum and maximum var amounts were 
million  million  
million and million  respectively 
during  our aggregate period end  daily average  minimum and maximum var amounts were million  million  million and million  respectively 
in addition to comparing var exposure against limits on a daily basis  we monitor loss limits  use sensitivity measures  and conduct stress tests and scenario analysis 
we report our market risk exposure and results of monitoring activities to the risk committee of the board of directors and to the market risk committee 
liquidity risk management we define liquidity as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  meet contractual obligations  and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 
liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned  as well as unanticipated  changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 
governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis 
this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity  as well as each entity s capacity to manage through adverse conditions 
the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 
oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the risk committee of the keycorp board of directors  the keybank board of directors  the erm committee and the alco 
these groups regularly review various liquidity reports  including liquidity and funding summaries  liquidity trends  peer comparisons  variance analyses  liquidity projections  hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports 
the reviews generate a discussion of positions  trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions 
when liquidity pressure is elevated  positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive 
we communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues 
factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events 
an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency 
examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war  natural disasters  political events  or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation  mutual fund or hedge fund 
similarly  market speculation  or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 
on march   fitch a credit rating agency downgraded keycorp s series a preferred stock to bb and keycorp s trust preferred securities to bb 
these rating downgrades were a result of a change in fitch s rating criteria that similarly affected securities ratings for many financial institutions 
our credit ratings at december   are shown in figure we believe that these credit ratings  under normal conditions in the capital markets  will enable the parent company or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 
figure credit ratings december  short term borrowings senior long term debt subordinated long term debt capital securities series a preferred stock keycorp the parent company standard poor s a bbb bbb bbb bbb moody s p baa baa baa ba fitch f a bbb bb bb dbrs r high bbb high bbb bbb bb low keybank standard poor s a a bbb n a n a moody s p a baa n a n a fitch f a bbb n a n a dbrs r low a low bbb high n a n a managing liquidity risk we regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding 
in the normal course of business  we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank 
in a heightened monitoring mode  we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently  and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment 
our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies 
erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods 
ultimately  they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations 
to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures  we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 
we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis 
the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions 
it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period 
as part of the plan  we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio 
during a problem period  that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer term strategy 
the liquid asset portfolio at december   totaled billion  consisting of billion of unpledged securities  billion of securities available for secured funding at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  and billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account 
the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity  heightened risk  or prefunding of expected outflows  such as debt maturities 
additionally  as of december   our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and billion at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati 
long term liquidity strategy our long term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits 
however  we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio  meet daily cash demands  and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives 
key s client based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which  in conjunction with intermediate and long term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base  supports our liquidity risk management strategy 
we use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies 
our target loan to deposit ratio is at december   our loan to deposit ratio was  which we calculate as total loans  loans held for sale  and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits  wholesale funding and liquid assets 
if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances  we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets 
conversely  excess cash generated by operating  investing and deposit gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 
liquidity programs we have several liquidity programs  described in note long term debt  that enable the parent company and keybank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally 
the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed 
there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 
in august  keybank adopted a billion global bank note program 
this program is similar to prior keybank note programs and allows keybank to issue notes  domestically and abroad  with original maturities of seven days or more for senior notes or five years or more for subordinated notes 
these notes may be denominated in us dollars or in foreign currencies 
each note will be the sole obligation of keybank 
on january   key issued billion of senior bank notes due february  under the global bank note program 
these notes have a coupon of per annum and are not redeemable prior to maturity 
in  key s outstanding note balance decreased by billion 
maturities of billion in medium term notes and million in subordinated notes occurred for keybank  while keycorp had maturities of million in medium term notes and payoffs totaling million related to redeemed trust preferred securities 
liquidity for keycorp the parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt  support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions  support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner  and without adverse consequences  and pay dividends to shareholders 
we use three primary measures to assess parent company liquidity net cash position  a cash coverage metric  and the liquidity gap 
the net cash position measures the ability to fund debt maturing in months or less with existing liquid assets 
the cash coverage metric measures the ability to meet all projected obligations 
the liquidity gap represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over several time horizons 
we generally issue term debt to manage our liquidity position within targeted ranges 
the parent company generally maintains cash and short term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next months 
at december   keycorp held billion in short term investments  which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations  including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our policies 
typically  the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank 
federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval 
a national bank s dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors  including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year  up to the date of dividend declaration 
in  keybank paid the parent billion in dividends  while nonbank subsidiaries did not make any dividend payments to the parent 
the parent did not make any capital infusions to keybank in as of january   keybank had fully utilized its regulatory capacity to pay dividends to keycorp 
during the first quarter of  keycorp completed a million equity offering at a price of per common share 
at the same time  keycorp issued billion  senior medium term notes  series i 
the proceeds from the sale of common shares and medium term notes were used  along with other available funds  to repurchase the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury 
the repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of million and discount amortization non cash of million  or million on an annual basis  related to these preferred shares 
our liquidity position and recent activity over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio  which includes overnight and short term investments  as well as unencumbered  high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios  has decreased as a result of debt maturities  trust preferred securities redemptions  and net customer loan and deposit flows 
however  the liquid asset portfolio still continues to exceed the amount we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer term solution 
on january   key issued billion of senior bank notes due february  under the global bank note program 
this issuance provided additional liquidity to support normal business flows and maintain our liquid asset portfolio within target levels 
from time to time  keycorp or keybank may seek to retire  repurchase or exchange outstanding debt  capital securities  preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase  privately negotiated transactions or other means 
we periodically repurchase common shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
additional information on keycorp s common share repurchase program is included in part ii  item unregistered sales of equity securities or use of proceeds of this report 
such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity and capital requirements  contractual restrictions  regulatory requirements and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material  individually or collectively 
we generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities 
we have approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december  as we consider alternative long term strategic and liquidity plans  opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately million in taxes to be paid 
if we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions  the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase by approximately million 
accordingly  we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at december  the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each year ended december   and credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms 
like other financial services institutions  we make loans  extend credit  purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts  all of which have related credit risk 
credit policy  approval and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program 
the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies 
these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 
our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval  is independent of our lines of business  and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans 
only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies 
it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate  but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level 
loan grades are assigned at the time of origination  verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter 
most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring 
this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling 
commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings 
the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation  the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility 
default probability is determined based on  among other factors  the financial strength of the borrower  an assessment of the borrower s management  the borrower s competitive position within its industry sector  and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook 
types of exposure  transaction structure and collateral  including credit risk mitigants  affect the expected recovery assessment 
our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans 
these models  known as scorecards  forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant 
the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system  which allows for real time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products 
we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 
we maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios 
for individual obligors  we employ a sliding scale of exposure  known as hold limits  which is dictated by the strength of the borrower 
our legal lending limit is approximately billion for any individual borrower 
however  internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than of that amount 
as of december   we had five client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than million 
the average amount outstanding on these five individual net obligor commitments was million at december  in general  our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 
we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate credit risk 
we utilize credit default swaps to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party 
at december   we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations 
we may also sell credit derivatives primarily single name credit default swaps to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity 
at december   the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of reducing our net credit default swap position was million 
credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
related gains or losses  as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection  are included in the trading income component of noninterest income 
we may also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales 
our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality 
allowance for loan and lease losses at december   the alll was million  or of loans  compared to billion  or  at december  the allowance includes million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of million at december   compared to million that was allocated for impaired loans of million one year ago

we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis 
the methodology used is described in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses 
briefly  we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in credit policies or underwriting standards  and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
for all commercial and consumer tdrs  regardless of size  as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than million  we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate 
we estimate the extent of impairment by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its expected cash flows  the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan s observable market price 
a specific allowance also may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full 
on at least a quarterly basis  we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses 
the alll at december   represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 
as shown in figure  our alll decreased by million  or  during the past twelve months 
this contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio  which has trended more favorably over the past twelve months 
asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance 
our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving 
we attribute this improvement to improving economic activity  more favorable conditions in the housing market  and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio 
our liability for credit losses on lending related commitments decreased by million to million at december   compared to the same period one year ago

these events include  among other things  threats to our cybersecurity  as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities 
operational risk also encompasses compliance risk  which is the risk of loss from violations of  or noncompliance with  laws  rules and regulations  prescribed practices  and ethical standards 
under the dodd frank act  large financial companies like key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance 
this heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk 
we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the dodd frank act 
resulting operational risk losses and or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges  increased operational costs  harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities 
we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk  alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance  and a system of internal controls and reporting 
we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws  rules and regulations 
for example  an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses 
this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action 
we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes 
this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board of directors 
the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure  governance  roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key 
primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business 
the operational risk committee  a senior management committee  oversees our level of operational risk and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities 
this committee and the operational risk management function are an integral part of our erm program 
our risk review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management program and our system of internal controls 
risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee  and independently supports the audit committee s oversight of these controls

net interest income our taxable equivalent net interest income was million for the fourth quarter of  and the net interest margin was 
these results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of million and a net interest margin of for the fourth quarter of the increase in net interest income and the net interest margin was primarily a result of a change in funding mix from the redemption of certain trust preferred securities  maturity of long term debt  and maturity of higher costing certificates of deposit during the past year 
noninterest income our noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of  compared to million for the year ago quarter 
net gains losses from loan sales increased million from the year ago quarter due to an increase in volume in our commercial mortgage banking business

the fourth quarter of included a million charge resulting from visa s announcement of a planned increase to its litigation escrow deposit 
noninterest expense our noninterest expense was million for the fourth quarter of  compared to million for the same period last year 
personnel expense increased million due to several factors an increase in contract labor for technology investments attributable to the previously announced credit card portfolio acquisitions and related implementation of new payment systems and merchant services processing  higher employee benefits due to an increase in medical claims expense and an adjustment to the annual retirement contribution accrual  and severance expense associated with our efficiency initiative 
nonpersonnel expense for the fourth quarter of decreased million from one year ago 
operating lease expense  oreo  and marketing expense decreased from the year ago quarter 
these declines were partially offset by an increase of million related to the amortization of the intangible assets associated with the third quarter acquisitions of the previously announced credit card portfolio as well as the branches in western new york

d eps may not foot due to rounding 
e this figure has been revised from what has previously been disclosed in our earnings release on january  critical accounting policies and estimates our business is dynamic and complex 
consequently  we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies 
these choices are critical  not only are they necessary to comply with gaap  they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance 
all accounting policies are important  and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 
in our opinion  some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility 
these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance  or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances  they may prove to be inaccurate  or we may find it necessary to change them 
as described below  we rely heavily on the use of judgment  assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee 
allowance for loan and lease losses the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet 
we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses 
for example  we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions  lending policies  underwriting standards  and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 
for all commercial and consumer troubled debt restructurings  regardless of size  as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than million  we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate 
for example  a specific allowance may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full 
we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the allowance for loan and lease losses when appropriate 
the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly  and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower 
however  since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects  and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating  we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 
in addition to adjusting the allowance for loan and lease losses to reflect market conditions  we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses 
for example  class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg  one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment 
conversely  the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile 
in either case  historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 
even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management s determination of the appropriate allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio 
to illustrate  an increase in estimated losses equal to one tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december   would indicate the need for a million increase in the allowance 
the same increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a million increase in the allowance 
such adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses can materially affect financial results 
following the above examples  a million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after tax basis by approximately million  or 
per share  a million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after tax basis by approximately million  or 
per share 
as we make decisions regarding the allowance  we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes 
nonetheless  if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate  the allowance for loan and lease losses would likely need to be adjusted  possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses 
valuation methodologies we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models  which are based on third party data as well as our judgment  assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality  liquidity  interest rates and other relevant market available inputs 
we describe our application of this accounting guidance  the process used to determine fair values  and the fair value hierarchy in note under the heading fair value measurements and in note fair value measurements 
valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment  particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued 
to determine the values of assets and liabilities  as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired  we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates  asset returns  prepayment rates and other factors 
the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results 
the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  including loans held for sale  principal investments  goodwill  and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
at december   billion  or  of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
substantially all of these assets were classified as level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
at december   billion  or  of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level or level at december   million  or  of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
approximately of these assets were classified as level or level at december   there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note under the heading loans held for sale 
our principal investments include direct and indirect investments  predominantly in privately held companies 
the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors  including the target company s financial condition and results of operations  values of public companies in comparable businesses  market liquidity  and the nature and duration of resale restrictions 
the fair value of principal investments was million at december  a positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our earnings by approximately million million after tax  or 
per share 
the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note under the heading goodwill and other intangible assets 
new accounting guidance that was effective january   for us permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required 
we did not choose to utilize this qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of therefore  the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank 
fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable 
however  if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used  the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 
the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value  suggesting goodwill impairment 
in such a case  we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit s net assets excluding goodwill 
any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
because the strength of the economic recovery remained uncertain during  we continued to monitor the impairment indicators for goodwill and other intangible assets  and to evaluate the carrying amount of these assets quarterly 
the acquisition of retail banking branches in western new york resulted in a million increase in the goodwill at the key community bank unit 
at december   the key community bank reporting unit had million in goodwill  while the key corporate bank reporting unit had no recorded goodwill 
additional information is provided in note goodwill and other intangible assets 
the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses  including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions  are presented in note employee benefits 
when potential asset impairment is identified  we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie  temporary or other than temporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment 
for example  unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders equity  those deemed other than temporary are recorded in either earnings or shareholders equity based on certain factors 
additional information regarding temporary and other than temporary impairment on securities available for sale at december   is provided in note securities 
derivatives and hedging we use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes 
these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance  which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value  after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements 
accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance  as well as to assess hedge effectiveness  identify similar hedged item groupings  and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items 
we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices 
however  interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve 
in the future  these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities 
although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition  a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note under the heading derivatives and note derivatives and hedging activities 
contingent liabilities  guarantees and income taxes note commitments  contingent liabilities and guarantees summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor  and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations 
we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee  but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount 
see note for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december  it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake 
in the normal course of business  we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities 
we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate 
however  if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate  the tax reserves may need to be adjusted  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 
additionally  we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized  and therefore recorded 
the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods  projected future taxable income  potential tax planning strategies  and projected future reversals of deferred tax items 
these assessments are subjective and may change 
based on these criteria  and in particular our projections for future taxable income  we currently believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods 
however  if our assessments prove incorrect  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur
