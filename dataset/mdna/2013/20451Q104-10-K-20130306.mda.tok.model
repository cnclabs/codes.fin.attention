overview compass diversified holdings  a delaware statutory trust  was incorporated in delaware on november  compass group diversified holdings  llc  a delaware limited liability company  was also formed on november  in accordance with the trust agreement  the trust is sole owner of of the trust interests as defined in the llc agreement of the company and  pursuant to the llc agreement  the company has outstanding  the identical number of trust interests as the number of outstanding shares of the trust 
the manager is the sole owner of the allocation interests of the company 
the company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities  similar to that of a delaware corporation 
the trust and the company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle market businesses headquartered in north america 
we characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to million 
we focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more susceptible to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow 
in pursuing new acquisitions  we seek businesses with the following characteristics north american base of operations  stable and growing earnings and cash flow  maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche ie  has a reason to exist  solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives  low technological and or product obsolescence risk  and a diversified customer and supplier base 
our management team s strategy for our subsidiaries involves utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract  recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses  regularly monitoring financial and operational performance  instilling consistent financial discipline  and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals  assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies both revenue and cost related  identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities  and forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives 

table of contents based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions  we believe we are well positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses 
our management team has a large network of approximately  deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions 
through this network  as well as our management team s active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts  we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets 
in consummating transactions  our management team has  in the past  been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions  including corporate spin offs  transitions of family owned businesses  management buy outs and reorganizations 
we believe the flexibility  creativity  experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with a strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target 
in addition  because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our revolving credit facility  we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing  as is typically the case in such acquisitions 
we believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate 
initial public offering and company formation on may   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of the trust at an offering price of per share the ipo 
subsequent to the ipo the company s board of directors engaged our manager to externally manage the day to day operations and affairs of the company  oversee the management and operations of the businesses and to perform those services customarily performed by executive officers of a public company

the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility 
we recorded a loss on the sale of halo of million 
distributions for the fiscal year we declared distributions to our shareholders totaling per share 
areas of focus in the areas of focus for  which are generally applicable to each of our businesses  include taking advantage  where possible to increase market share in each of our market niche leading companies at the expense of less well capitalized competitors  achieving sales growth  technological excellence and manufacturing capability through global expansion  continuing to grow through disciplined  strategic acquisitions and rigorous integration processes  continuing to pursue expense reduction and cost savings through contraction in discretionary spending  and reductions in workforce and production levels in response to lower production volume  and driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management enabling continued investment in our businesses  strategic acquisitions  and enabling us to return value to our shareholders 
middle market deal flow during was mixed  with tax driven transactions increasing offset by the impact that uncertain macroeconomic and political environments had on potential sellers 
valuation levels for high quality acquisitions were robust due to well capitalized strategic and financial buyers seeking to deploy equity capital coupled with the availability of debt financing with attractive terms 
despite current softness  we are cautiously optimistic that will reverse this trend of fewer transactions and believe that acquisition opportunities may increase for us in the latter half of as the overall acquisition environment improves  as well as due to certain marketing initiatives we are currently undertaking

net sales on a consolidated basis  net sales increased million for the year ended december  compared to  and million for the year ended december  compared to the increases for both years are due principally to increased revenues and in the case of arnold magnetics and camelbak  incremental revenues at each of our segments with the exception of american furniture and tridien

table of contents we do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own 
we may generate interest income on the investment of available funds  but expect such earnings to be minimal 
our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the company to such businesses  as well as equity interests in those businesses 
cash flows coming to the trust and the company are the result of interest payments on those loans  amortization of those loans and  in some cases  dividends on our equity ownership 
however  on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated

gross profit as a percentage of net sales totaled approximately for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales for both the year ended december  compared to the same period in and the year ended december  compared to the same period in is principally attributable to the inclusion of the incremental camelbak net sales in and and the inclusion of twelve months of ergobaby net sales in compared to three months in camelbak gross profit margin during the year ended december  was approximately and ergobaby s gross profit margin in was approximately

selling  general and administrative expense on a consolidated basis  selling  general and administrative expense increased approximately million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  and increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the majority of these increases are due to increases in costs directly tied to sales  such as commissions and direct customer support services  and incremental selling  general and administrative costs over the prior year at ergobaby s orbit baby segment  arnold magnetics and camelbak during million and camelbak and ergobaby during over the prior year million 
at the corporate level  general and administrative costs increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in and decreased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the year over year increase in is due principally to i a non cash charge totaling approximately million related to the decrease in the fair value of a call option granted to the former ceo of tridien during  ii increased audit fees in connection with the arnold acquisition million  and increased salaries and wages million

we accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis 
for the years ended december   and we incurred approximately million  million and million respectively  in expense for these fees 
the increase in management fees for the year ended december  compared to the same period in is due principally to the increase in consolidated adjusted net assets as of december  in connection with the arnold magnetics acquisition in march the increase in management fees in compared to is due principally to the inclusion of the acquisition of camelbak in our consolidated adjusted net assets  offset in part by the million impairment charge at american furniture

this expense represents that portion of the estimated increase decrease in the fair value of our businesses over our original basis in those businesses that our manager is entitled to if the msa were terminated or those businesses were sold 
the annual charges in each of the years   and reflect a net increase in fair value of our majority owned subsidiaries compared to the previous year

impairment expense we incurred an impairment charge at american furniture in the years ended december  and december  totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
american furniture incurred an impairment charge to its goodwill million  trade name million  and long lived assets million aggregating million during the year ended december   which was triggered based on results of operations which had deteriorated significantly during the year 
in addition  in connection with the cessation and outsourcing of afm s internal trucking operations we reclassified a number of trucks  trailers and a warehouse from property  plant and equipment to assets held for sale 
in connection with this we wrote these assets down from their net book value to an amount equal to their net realizable value less disposal costs with the difference  aggregating approximately million  being charged to impairment expense 
during the year ended we wrote down the value of goodwill by million and the value of its trade name by million 
in all cases the write downs were triggered by a significant deterioration in american furniture s operations and profitability caused by an unprecedented drop in the promotional furniture market and demand for its product 
the combination of increased unemployment  together with significant decreases in home purchases and availability of consumer credit has created the worst market for promotional furniture sales over the last two years that has been experienced over the last two decades 
the remaining noncurrent asset subject to fair value testing at american furniture is its trade name totaling approximately million and property and equipment totaling million 
we do not anticipate any further write downs to american furniture s assets going forward 
we completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of march  and there was no indication of goodwill impairment at any of our reporting units 
results of operations our businesses as previously discussed  we acquired our businesses on various acquisition dates beginning may  see table above 
as a result  our consolidated operating results only include the results of operations since the acquisition date associated with each of our businesses

adjustments to depreciation and amortization resulting from purchase allocations that are not pushed down to a business are not included as a component of operating results 
we believe this presentation enhances the discussion and provides a more meaningful comparison of operating results 
the following operating results of our businesses are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year  going forward 
advanced circuits overview advanced circuits is a provider of prototype  quick turn and volume production pcbs to customers throughout the united states 
collectively  prototype and quick turn pcbs represent approximately of advanced circuits gross revenues 
prototype and quick turn pcbs typically command higher margins than volume production pcbs given that customers require high levels of responsiveness  technical support and timely delivery of prototype and quick turn pcbs and are willing to pay a premium for them 
advanced circuits is able to meet its customers demands by manufacturing custom pcbs in as little as hours  while maintaining over error free production rates and real time customer service and product tracking hours per day 

table of contents while global demand for pcbs has remained strong in recent years  industry wide domestic production has declined since in contrast  advanced circuits revenues increased steadily through saw a slight reduction and increased again in and  as its customers prototype and quick turn pcb requirements  such as small quantity orders and rapid turnaround  are less able to be met by low cost volume manufacturers in asia and elsewhere 
advanced circuits management anticipates that demand for its prototype and quick turn printed circuit boards will remain strong and anticipates that demand will be impacted less by current economic conditions than by its longer lead time production business  which is driven more by consumer purchasing patterns and capital investments by businesses 
we purchased a controlling interest in advanced circuits on may  on march   advanced circuits acquired circuit express based in tempe  arizona for approximately million 
circuit express focuses on quick turn manufacturing of prototype and low volume quantities of rigid pcbs primarily for aerospace and defense related customers

the increase in sales in all sectors  with the exception of assembly sales  is attributable to incremental sales associated with universal circuits during the year ended december  the increase in promotion and discount charges in compared to the same period of are principally the result of increased discounting and price promotions incurred during in response to competitor s pricing in the long lead sector

gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased during the year ended december  at december  compared to at december  
this decrease in margin is principally the result of i the promotional pricing in long lead pcb sales during the year ended december  noted above impact  ii sales attributable to universal circuits impact  and a larger proportion of assembly sales during the year ended december   compared to  each which carry lower margins 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased approximately million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in due principally to costs incurred at universal circuits for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative costs were of net sales in the year ended december  compared to during the same period in income from operations operating income for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to million earned in the same period in  a decrease of approximately million  principally as a result of those factors described above 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  were approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in gross sales is principally due to increased sales in quick turn million and prototype million production pcbs  offset in part by a decrease in revenues from long lead million and sub contract million production pcbs 
quick turn production pcbs represented approximately of gross sales for the year ended december  compared to approximately for the fiscal year ended december  prototype production represented approximately of gross sales for the year ended december  compared to approximately for the same period in assembly sales which increased approximately million represented approximately of gross sales in compared to approximately in the increase in gross sales in both the quick turn and prototype production in when compared to is partially the result of sales attributable to aci tempe operations circuit express for a full twelve month period in the year ended december  the decrease in sales attributable to sub contract and assembly production is principally attributable to the company s broader service offerings following its acquisition of circuit express and reduced need to sub contract 
cost of sales cost of sales for the fiscal year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
the increase in cost of sales was largely due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  was compared to in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales in is principally the result of a larger portion of revenue being driven from the company s tempe operations which carry a lower gross margin

this increase primarily was the result of increased net sales and other factors described above 
american furniture overview founded in and headquartered in ecru  mississippi  american furniture is a leading us manufacturer of upholstered furniture  focused exclusively on the promotional segment of the furniture industry 
american furniture offers a broad product line of stationary and motion furniture  including sofas  loveseats  sectionals  recliners and complementary products  sold primarily at retail price points ranging between and  american furniture is a low cost manufacturer and is able to ship most products in its line to over customers within hours of receiving an order 
american furniture s products are adapted from established designs in the following categories i motion and recliner  ii stationary  iii occasional chair and  iv accent tables 
american furniture incurred an impairment charge to its goodwill million  trade name million and long lived assets million aggregating million during the year ended december   which was triggered based on results of operations which had deteriorated significantly during the year 
in addition  in connection with the cessation and outsourcing of afm s internal trucking operations we reclassified a number of trucks  trailers and a warehouse from property  plant and equipment to assets held for sale 
in connection with this  we wrote these assets down from their net book value to an amount equal to their net realizable value less disposal costs with the difference  aggregating approximately million  being charged to impairment expense 
during the year ended  we wrote down the value of goodwill by million and the value of its trade name by million 
in all cases the write downs were triggered by a significant deterioration in american furniture s operations and profitability caused by an unprecedented drop in the promotional furniture market and demand for its product 
the combination of increased unemployment  together with significant decreases in home purchases and availability of consumer credit has created the worst market for promotional furniture sales over the last two years than has been experienced over the last two decades 
american furniture implemented a revised standard costing system in the year which required american furniture to reclassify certain costs between cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the change in format consists of reclassifying the trucking fleet expenses from selling  general and administrative expenses into cost of sales as well as re classifying certain manufacturing related expenses including rent  insurance  utilities and workers compensation from selling  general and administrative costs to cost of sales 
the format of reporting cost of sales going forward together with the revised standard costing system and the revaluation of standard costs allows management to more timely react to changes in supply costs  product demand and overall price structure going forward  which in turn has mitigated the accumulation of lower margin product and has allowed for more advantageous product procurement 
the results of operations for the years ended december  and includes the million reclassification from selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of sales in order to make them consistent with current presentation

the decrease in gross sales in the stationary and motion product categories and other products is principally the result of a continued soft current retail environment which has caused increasing competition in pricing in the promotional furniture category during the year ended december  in addition  our inability to ship certain products during the first quarter  due to a delay in receiving fabric kits that we outsource to china that we were not able to replace  contributed approximately million to the decline in sales 
sales to a large national retailer decreased approximately million in compared to we do not expect to recapture these sales in the increase in recliner product sales is the result of supplying product to one of our largest customers for their recliner promotion event 
cost of sales cost of sales decreased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the same period of and is due primarily to the corresponding decrease in sales 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in the year ended december  compared to in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales of approximately during the year ended december  is principally attributable to i a million write off to adjust overhead absorption in inventory resulting from adjustments to its standard costs in july  ii lower direct labor costs  primarily due to increased efficiencies in stationary and recliner production  and  iii increased selling prices on products and fewer closeout offerings over the course of the year due to the improvement of our inventory management 
a number of cost saving initiatives were implemented throughout  including facility consolidation and outsourcing frame cutting that contributed to the increase in gross profit margins in compared to that we believe will continue to have a positive impact on gross profit margins in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december   decreased approximately million compared to the same period of this decrease is primarily due to decreased costs of advertising and marketing million and salaries and benefits million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of impairment expense american furniture incurred an impairment charges aggregating million  during the year ended december  see explanation below 
loss from operations loss from operations totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to a loss from operations of approximately million in the year ended december  the significant decline in operating loss was principally due the factors described above  particularly the impairment charge in fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased approximately million or over the corresponding period in stationary product net sales decreased million for the period while motion and recliner sales decreased million 
occasional chairs  accent tables and rug sales decreased million in compared to the decrease in product sales is the result of the softer furniture retail environment  especially in the more expensive product categories  such as our motion products  and the increasing presence of asian import product which often offers a better overall value proposition to customers 
the decrease in net sales of recliners  chairs  tables and rugs in is due to an overall weaker retail market for promotional furniture offerings in than in the promotional retail furniture market continues to be impacted by downward pressure from lower consumer spending on new furniture due principally to the limited access to credit available to new home buyers 
retail furniture sales rely heavily on consumer spending for new furniture when they move into a new home 
in addition  the weak domestic overall economic environment coupled with high unemployment has had a significant negative effect on the promotional furniture market due to the impact it has had on the consumer who purchases our product 
sales to american furniture s largest customer decreased approximately million in fiscal compared to cost of sales cost of sales decreased by approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the same period of due principally to a corresponding decrease in sales

the increase in non dealer sales in is due in large part to increased sales to liberty s two largest non dealer accounts in connection with their expansion of new stores in liberty is the sole provider of safes to these two accounts

cgm s profit allocation was million and was paid in the fourth quarter of reconciliation of non gaap financial measures from time to time we may publicly disclose certain non gaap financial measures in the course of our investor presentations  earnings releases  earnings conference calls or other venues 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future performance  financial position or cash flow that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts  included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in our financial statements  and vice versa for measures that include amounts  or are subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure as calculated and presented 
gaap refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
non gaap financial measures are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results 
these measures are not meant to be a substitute for gaap  and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
the tables below reconcile the most directly comparable gaap financial measures to ebitda  adjusted ebitda and cash flow available for distribution and reinvestment cad 
reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is calculated as net income loss before interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation expense and amortization expense 
amortization expenses consist of amortization of intangibles and debt charges  including debt issuance costs  discounts  etc 

table of contents adjusted ebitda is calculated utilizing the same calculation as described above in arriving at ebitda further adjusted by i non controlling stockholder compensation  which generally consists of non cash stock option expense  ii successful acquisition costs  which consist of transaction costs legal  accounting  due diligences  etc 
incurred in connection with the successful acquisition of a business expensed during the period in compliance with asc  iii increases or decreases in supplemental put charges  which reflect the estimated potential liability due to our manager that requires us to acquire their allocation interests in the company at a price based on a percentage of the fair value in our businesses over their original basis plus a hurdle rate 
essentially  when the fair value of our businesses increases we will incur additional supplemental put charges and vice versa when the fair value of our businesses decreases  iv management fees  which reflect fees due quarterly to our manager in connection with our msa  v impairment charges  which reflect write downs to goodwill or other intangible assets and vi gains or losses recorded in connection with the sale of fixed assets 
we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide useful information to investors and reflect important financial measures as they exclude the effects of items which reflect the impact of long term investment decisions  rather than the performance of near term operations 
when compared to net income loss these financial measures are limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capital assets used in generating revenues of our businesses or the non cash charges associated with impairments 
this presentation also allows investors to view the performance of our businesses in a manner similar to the methods used by us and the management of our businesses  provides additional insight into our operating results and provides a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition 
we believe these measurements are also useful in measuring our ability to service debt and other payment obligations 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not meant to be a substitute for gaap  and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non gaap financial measures used by other companies

cad is a non gaap measure that we believe provides additional information to our shareholders in order to enable them to evaluate our ability to make anticipated quarterly distributions 
because other entities do not necessarily calculate cad the same way we do  our presentation of cad may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other entities 
we believe that our historic and future cad  together with our cash balances and access to cash via our debt facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated distributions over the next twelve months

cash flows of certain of our businesses are seasonal in nature 
cash flows from american furniture are typically highest in the months of january through april of each year  coinciding with homeowners tax refunds 
revenue and earnings from fox are typically highest in the third quarter  coinciding with the delivery of product for the new bike year 
earnings from camelbak are typically higher in the spring and summer months than other months as this corresponds with warmer weather in the northern hemisphere and an increase in hydration related activities

critical accounting estimates the following discussion relates to critical accounting estimates for the company  the trust and each of our businesses at december  the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap will require management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting estimates are discussed below 
these critical accounting estimates are reviewed by our independent auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors 
supplemental put agreement in connection with our msa  we entered into a supplemental put agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager has the right to cause the company to purchase the allocation interests then owned by our manager upon termination of the msa for a price to be determined in accordance with the supplemental put agreement 
the fair value of the supplemental put is determined using a model that multiplies the trailing twelve month ebitda for each reporting unit by an estimated enterprise value multiple to determine an estimated selling price of that reporting unit 
we then deduct estimated selling and disposal costs in arriving at a net estimated selling price that is then input into an iterative supplemental put calculation which takes into account  among other things  contractually defined cumulative contribution based profit in order to arrive at the estimated manager s profit allocation accrual required  reflected on the balance sheet as the supplemental put liability 
we review the model quarterly and make updates to ebitda and cumulative contribution based profit 
when appropriate we may change the estimated enterprise value multiple if the market for the particular reporting unit has changed 
we review the model and assumptions with our manager each quarter 
since some of our manager s functions are to i identify  evaluate  manage  perform due diligence on  negotiate and oversee the acquisitions of target businesses by us and ii evaluate  manage  negotiate and oversee the disposition of all or any part of our property  assets or investments  including dispositions of all or any part of our reporting units  we feel that our manager is particularly skilled at reviewing and commenting on this data 
annually  we prepare a detailed analysis of the estimated enterprise value multiple for each of our reporting units  which is one of the primary drivers used to calculate the estimated selling price 
in addition  annually  we engage an independent investment banking firm to review the estimated enterprise value multiple for reasonableness taking into account comparable company data  comparable transactions and discounted cash flow analyses dcf 

table of contents the methodology and results employed in the market approach for goodwill impairment testing for each of our reporting units is most similar to the methodology and results reflected in calculating the estimated selling price of each of our reporting units for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the supplemental put 
we typically assign a higher weighting to the market approach as opposed to the dcf in calculating the estimated selling price of the reporting units for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the supplemental put than we do for estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  which accounts for the major differences in value 
the higher weighting is based on the premise that because the manager can unilaterally resign  the company will be required to remit the profit allocation supplemental put value as of a specific point in time 
this one sided put on behalf of the manager is the principle reason that we are required to reflect this liability on our balance sheet 
the impact of over estimating or under estimating the value of the supplemental put agreement could have a material effect on operating results 
in addition  the value of the supplemental put agreement is subject to the volatility of our operations which may result in significant fluctuation in the value assigned to this supplemental put agreement 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
provisions for customer returns and other allowances based on historical experience are recognized at the time the related sale is recognized 
business combinations the acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  to be recorded as identifiable intangibles or goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management team  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information typically includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
this judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets 
the impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and or depreciation expense 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
we are required to perform impairment reviews at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
annual goodwill impairment testing goodwill represents the excess amount of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
we are required to perform impairment reviews of goodwill balances at each of our reporting units ru at least annually and more frequently in certain circumstances 
each of our businesses represents a ru and arnold is comprised of three ru 
each of our ru is subject to impairment review at march   which represents our annual date for impairment testing  with the exception of american furniture 
the balance of american furniture s goodwill was completely written off in the financial accounting standards board issued an accounting standards update asu in september that permits companies to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a ru fair value is less than it carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if a company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount it is not required to perform the two step impairment test for that reporting unit 
this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at march  we elected to use the qualitative assessment alternative to test goodwill for impairment for each of our ru that maintain a goodwill carrying value 

table of contents as prescribed by the asu  factors to consider when making the qualitative assessment prior to performing step of the goodwill impairment test are as follows macroeconomic conditions such as deterioration in general economic conditions  limitations on accessing capital  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  or other developments in equity and credit markets  industry and market considerations such as deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates  an increased competitive environment  a decline both absolute and relative to its peers in market dependent multiples or metrics  a change in the market for an entity s products or services  or a regulatory or political development  cost factor  such as increases in raw materials  labor  or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows  overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods  other relevant entity specific events such as litigation  contemplation of bankruptcy  or changes in management  key personnel  strategy  or customers  events affecting a ru such as change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets  a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing of all or a portion  of a ru  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or a recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit  and sustained decrease both absolute and relative to its peers in share price  if applicable 
in addition to considering the above factors we performed the following procedures as of march  for each of our ru  compared and assessed trailing twelve month ttm net sales as of march  to ttm nets sales as of march  compared and assessed ttm operating income as of march  to ttm operating income as of march   compared and assessed ttm adjusted ebitda as of march  to adjusted ebitda as of march   compared and assessed adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  to budget  compared and assessed adjusted ebitda for the three months ended march  to budget  compared the fair value of each of our ru to its carrying amount using the same metrics as those used in determining the value of the supplemental put as of march  and concluded that in each case the fair value of the ru was in excess of its carrying amount  and performed market cap reconciliation for codi and determined that codi s public market cap was significantly in excess of the fair value of its consolidated equity as derived from the aforementioned supplemental put analysis 
based on our qualitative assessment as outlined above we believe that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our ru is less than its carrying amount at march  in addition there are no triggering events at any of of our ru which would lead us to believe that the fair value of the ru is less than its carrying value 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts on an entity by entity basis with consideration for historical loss experience  customer payment patterns and current economic trends 
the company reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis and adjusts the balance  if necessary 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment by management 
the impact of either over or under estimating the allowance could have a material effect on future operating results 
the consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately million at december  deferred tax assets several of our majority owned subsidiaries have deferred tax assets recorded at december  which in total amount to approximately million 
this deferred tax asset is net of million of valuation allowance primarily associated with afm s inability to utilize loss carryforwards associated with impairments in and and losses in these deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of reserves not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the temporary differences that have resulted in the recording of these tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
based upon the expected future results of operations  we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of existing temporary 
table of contents differences  although there can be no assurance of this 
the impact of not realizing these deferred tax assets would result in an increase in income tax expense for such period when the determination was made that the assets are not realizable 
see note k income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements refer to footnote b to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity at december   we were exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our credit facility because borrowings under this agreement are subject to variable interest rates 
we had outstanding million under the term loan facility at december  our exposure to fluctuation in variable interest on million in outstanding term loan facility is hedged with an interest rate cap effective december  with a term of two years 
this cap fixes the future libor rate to be incurred by us at a maximum of 
we expect to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future in order to finance our short term working capital needs and future acquisitions 
these borrowings will be subject to variable interest rates 
exchange rate sensitivity at december   we were not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate risks that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash equivalents  investments  and trade receivables 
we do not believe that our cash equivalents or investments present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  consists principally of i treasury backed securities  ii insured prime money market funds  iii fdic insured certificates of deposit  and iv cash balances in several non interest bearing checking accounts 
substantially all trade receivable balances of our businesses are unsecured 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is limited by the large number of customers in our customer base and their dispersion across various industries and geographic areas 
although we have a large number of customers who are dispersed across different industries and geographic areas  a prolonged economic downturn could increase our exposure to credit risk on our trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses
