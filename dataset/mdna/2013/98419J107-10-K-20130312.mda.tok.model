item business overview xoma corporation xoma  a delaware corporation  discovers and develops innovative antibody based therapeutics 
our lead drug candidate  gevokizumab formerly xoma  is a potent humanized monoclonal antibody with unique allosteric modulating properties 
gevokizumab binds to the inflammatory cytokine interleukin beta il beta  which we believe to be a primary trigger of pathologic inflammation in multiple diseases 
we have entered into a license and collaboration agreement with les laboratoires servier servier to develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications 
in collaboration with servier we have launched the global phase gevokizumab clinical development program for active and controlled non infectious uveitis niu involving the intermediate and or posterior segment of the eye  and beh et s uveitis 
xoma is conducting both of the niu studies  and servier is sponsoring the phase study in beh et s uveitis 
the study sites are screening and enrolling patients in these separate studies 
separately  we launched a phase proof of concept program for gevokizumab to evaluate additional indications for further development  including a clinical trial in moderate to severe inflammatory acne  for which we reported encouraging top line results in january  a clinical trial in erosive osteoarthritis of the hand  which was opened for enrollment in june  and a clinical trial in scleritis that will be conducted by the national eye institute nei  a part of the us national institutes of health nih 
we anticipate the nei will begin enrolling patients in this study during the first quarter of we expect servier to institute its own proof of concept program for gevokizumab in different indications from ours 
in november  servier began a phase study to determine gevokizumab s potential to treat patients who have experienced a recent acute coronary syndrome 
our proprietary preclinical pipeline includes classes of antibodies that activate  sensitize  or deactivate the insulin receptor in vivo  that we have named xmet 
this portfolio of antibodies represents potential new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of diabetes and several diseases that involve insulin  which we believe may be orphan drug opportunities 

table of contents we have developed these and other antibodies using some or all of our adapt antibody discovery and development platform  our modulx technologies for generating allosterically modulating antibodies  and our optimx technologies for optimizing biophysical properties of antibodies  including affinity  immunogenicity  stability and manufacturability 
our biodefense initiatives include xoma ab  a biodefense anti botulism product candidate comprised of a combination of three antibodies 
xoma ab is directed against botulinum toxin serotype a and has been developed through funding from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid  a part of the nih 
all volunteers have been enrolled and dosed with xoma ab in a phase clinical trial sponsored by niaid 
in january  we announced we will complete niaid biodefense contracts currently in place but will not actively pursue future contracts 
should the government choose to acquire xoma ab or other biodefense products in the future  we expect to be able to produce these antibodies through an outside manufacturer 
we also have developed antibody product candidates with premier pharmaceutical companies including novartis ag novartis and takeda pharmaceutical company limited takeda 
two antibodies developed with novartis  lfa and hcd lucatumumab  are in phase and or phase clinical development by novartis for the potential treatment of breast or prostate cancer and hematological malignancies  respectively 
in january  we announced we had acquired certain us rights to a portfolio of antihypertensive products from servier 
the portfolio includes aceon perindopril erbumine  a currently marketed angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor  and three fixed dose combination fdc product candidates where perindopril is combined with another active ingredient s 
the last to expire proprietary form of perindopril in each fdc product candidate provides patent protection until april we assumed commercialization activities for aceon in january in november  we announced that the patient phase trial for the fdc of perindopril arginine and amlodipine besylate fdc met its primary endpoint 
partial funding for the trial was provided by servier 
we expect to pay the balance of study expenses  consisting primarily of costs generated by our contract research organization  from the profits generated by our aceon sales 
we are working to identify a third party organization that could sublicense this fdc and move it forward toward commercialization in the us market 
in january  we implemented a streamlining and restructuring plan designed to sharpen our focus on value creating opportunities  particularly gevokizumab and our antibody discovery and development capabilities 
the plan included a personnel reduction of positions  or of our staff 
these staff reductions resulted primarily from our decisions to utilize a contract manufacturing organization for phase and commercial antibody production and to eliminate internal research functions that are non differentiating or that can be obtained cost effectively by contract service providers 
in august  servier and we announced xoma had entered into an agreement with boehringer ingelheim to transfer our technology and processes for the validation of our technology and processes in preparation for the commercial manufacture of gevokizumab 
it is our intention that boehringer ingelheim will produce gevokizumab at its facility in biberach  germany for xoma s commercial use 
product development strategy we are advancing a pipeline of antibody product candidates using our proven expertise  technologies and capabilities from antibody discovery through product development 
for products that we have the potential to market on our own in the us with a targeted sales force  we will develop the compound in a lead indication and expand the asset s value by conducting proof of concept studies in additional indications 
we will seek a partner for all non us development and commercial activities 
for product candidates that require a large sales force or an exceptionally large clinical development program  we will seek to out license the candidates on economic terms that reflect the potential commercial value of the asset 
the principal elements of our strategy are to focus on advancing gevokizumab  our lead product candidate 
using our proprietary antibody technologies and allosteric modulating capabilities and expertise  we discovered gevokizumab  an antibody that modulates il beta  a cytokine that triggers inflammatory pathways in the body 
we believe gevokizumab  by targeting il beta  has the potential to address the underlying inflammatory causes of a wide range of unmet medical needs 
in december  we entered into an agreement with servier to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications  which provided for a non refundable upfront payment of million that we received in january in connection with this agreement  servier is funding the first million of gevokizumab global clinical development expenses and the first million of gevokizumab chemistry and manufacturing controls cmc expenses for all development expenses for niu and beh et s uveitis 
all such expenses will be shared by both companies on a basis after these initial amounts are incurred 
we have incurred the first million in cmc expenses in and expect to have incurred the first million in clinical development expenses at some time during 
table of contents servier and we have initiated an expanded gevokizumab clinical development plan 
the plan includes two global phase trials in active and controlled niu involving the intermediate and or posterior segments of the eye and a phase trial outside the us in a subset of niu patients who suffer from beh et s uveitis 
all three phase trials have been initiated the active niu trial in june  named eyeguard a  the beh et s uveitis trial in september  named eyeguard b  and the controlled niu trial in october  named eyeguard c 
in addition to establishing efficacy  these trials have been designed to meet the fda safety requirement for ophthalmic indications at least patients must be treated for at least six months and patients for one year at the to be marketed dose 
we anticipate we will have preliminary top line results from eyeguard a at year end  eyeguard b during the first half of  and eyeguard c during the first quarter of we also initiated a phase proof of concept clinical program to identify additional conditions that may respond to treatment with gevokizumab 
the program is evaluating gevokizumab in three separate diseases that have demonstrated il beta involvement 
the first study in moderate to severe inflammatory acne began enrolling patients in december in january  we announced the top line results from the study  which demonstrated gevokizumab has a dose dependent benefit on moderate to severe acne lesions 
this study also identified a non effective dose  and the information we have generated with this study should allow us to conduct a robust phase study should we choose moderate to severe acne as our next phase indication 
in june  we announced that the second clinical study in the gevokizumab proof of concept program in patients with erosive osteoarthritis of the hand was opened for enrollment 
we anticipate we will have results from this study in the third quarter of in december  we announced the third clinical study in this program  which will study gevokizumab in patients with active non infectious anterior scleritis 
this study will be conducted by the nei 
we anticipate the nei will initiate patient enrollment in this study in the first quarter of  and we anticipate we will have data from this study in late separately  in november  we announced servier had initiated the first servier sponsored phase proof of concept study in patients who had experienced a recent acute coronary syndrome 
in we plan to meet with the us food and drug administration fda to discuss the possibility for xoma and servier to enter into phase clinical studies in one or both of two potential additional indications  neutrophilic dermatoses and schnitzler syndrome 
we believe these two indications are rare diseases  which we consider to be diseases affecting less than one in  persons 
therefore  we intend to pursue orphan drug designations for one or both of these indications 
we believe each represents an attractive market because each may be eligible for accelerated approval pathways with the fda  increasing the potential for shorter development timelines and faster paths to commercialization 
advance our proprietary preclinical pipeline candidates and generate revenues from our proprietary technologies 
we continue to develop our proprietary preclinical pipeline  primarily focusing on the development of allosteric modulating monoclonal antibodies 
our most advanced program  which targets the insulin receptor  has generated three new classes of fully human monoclonal antibodies 
these allosteric modulating antibodies activate xmeta or sensitize xmets or antagonize deactivate xmetd the insulin receptor in vivo 
xmeta and xmets represent the potential for distinct  new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diabetes 
separate preclinical studies of xmeta and xmets have demonstrated reduced fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in mouse models of diabetes 
to increase the value of these assets  we have chosen to continue developing both antibodies internally  which should allow us to negotiate a more substantial return to xoma on any sales that xmeta and xmets may generate 
ultimately  we expect to seek a partner for development and commercialization of these assets at a future date 
in the case of xmetd  we plan to develop this compound internally  as it has potential as a treatment for as many as three rare life threatening or severely debilitating diseases insulinomas  congenital hyperinsulinism and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in post gastric bypass surgery patients 

table of contents historically  we have established technology collaborations with several companies to provide access to xoma s proprietary antibody discovery and optimization technologies 
in addition  we have licensed our bacterial cell expression bce technology to more than companies in exchange for license  milestone and other fees  royalties and complementary technologies 
a number of licensed product candidates developed through these technology collaborations are in clinical development 
we believe we can continue to generate licensing revenue from our proprietary technologies in the future 
complete current biodefense contracts 
to date  we have been awarded four contracts  totaling approximately million  from niaid to support development of xoma ab and several product candidates for the treatment of botulism poisoning 
in addition  our biodefense programs included two subcontracts from sri international totaling million  funded through niaid  for the development of antibodies to neutralize hn and hn influenza viruses and the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
niaid is conducting a phase trial of xoma ab  a novel formulation of three antibodies designed to prevent and treat botulism poisoning 
this double blind  dose escalation study in approximately healthy volunteers is designed to assess the safety and tolerability and determine the pharmacokinetic profile of xoma ab 
all volunteers in this trial have been enrolled and dosed with xoma ab 
in january  we announced we will complete niaid biodefense contracts currently in place but will not actively pursue future contracts 
should the government choose to acquire xoma ab or other biodefense products in the future  we expect to be able to produce these antibodies through an outside manufacturer 
commercialization strategy we are committed to establishing xoma as a commercial organization in the us to capture appropriate value from our product discovery and development programs 
we expect to establish our us commercial presence by utilizing small targeted sales teams that are focused exclusively on marketing our products to specialized physician groups 
for indications that require large numbers of sales representatives  particularly for indications that are treated in the primary care setting  we will seek strategic partnerships with companies that have the expertise in marketing products to this diverse audience 
we announced we acquired us rights and had assumed commercialization activities for the branded antihypertensive product aceon perindopril erbumine  an fda approved ace inhibitor  from servier and its previous us licensee in january in addition to aceon  upon exercise by us of an option with respect to each product  the acquisition includes a portfolio of additional fdc product candidates where perindopril is combined with another active ingredient s  such as a calcium channel blocker 
aceon is subject to competition from multiple approved generic perindopril erbumine products  and our commercialization activities are limited to distribution and post marketing regulatory responsibilities as the current holder of the aceon new drug application nda 
we have contracted with third parties to manufacture and distribute aceon 
proprietary products as part of our strategy  we are focusing our technology and resources on advancing our emerging proprietary pipeline 
below is a summary of our proprietary products gevokizumab is a potent monoclonal antibody with unique allosteric modulating properties and has the potential to treat patients with a wide variety of inflammatory diseases and other diseases 
gevokizumab binds strongly to il beta  a pro inflammatory cytokine involved in niu and beh et s uveitis  moderate to severe inflammatory acne  erosive osteoarthritis of the hand  active non infectious anterior scleritis  cardiovascular disease  neutrophilic dermatoses  schnitzler syndrome  and other diseases 
by binding to il beta  gevokizumab modulates the activation of the il receptor  thereby preventing the cellular signaling events that produce inflammation 
gevokizumab is a humanized igg antibody 
based on its binding properties  specificity for il beta and its half life the time it takes for the amount administered to be reduced by one half in the body  gevokizumab may provide convenient dosing of once per month or less frequently 
in december  we entered into an agreement with servier to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications 

table of contents xoma metabolic activating  sensitizing and antagonizing deactivating antibodies xmet 
insulin receptor activating antibodies  such as xmeta  are designed to provide long acting insulin like activity to diabetic patients who cannot make sufficient insulin  potentially reducing the number of insulin injections needed to control their blood glucose levels 
insulin receptor sensitizing antibodies  such as xmets  are designed to reduce insulin resistance and could enable diabetic patients to use their own insulin more effectively to control blood glucose levels 
insulin receptor antagonizing deactivating antibodies  such as xmetd  are designed to treat several diseases that result from the continuous overproduction of or inappropriate reaction to insulin 
there are three orphan indications that may benefit from xmetd that are of greatest interest to us insulinomas  congenital hyperinsulinism  and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia post gastric bypass surgery 
studies presented on xmeta have demonstrated it reduced fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in a mouse model of diabetes 
after six weeks of treatment  mice treated with xmeta had a statistically significant reduction in hbac levels  a standard measure of average blood glucose levels over time  compared to the control mice 
in addition  there was a statistically significant reduction in elevated non hdl cholesterol levels 
we studied xmets in a mouse model of obesity induced insulin resistance 
in mice treated with xmets  we saw enhanced insulin sensitivity and statistically significant improvements in fasting blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance as compared to the control mice 
in addition  there was a statistically significant reduction in elevated non hdl cholesterol levels 
xoma ab is a multi antibody product designed to neutralize the most potent of the botulinum toxins  type a  which causes paralysis and is a bioterrorism threat 
our anti botulism program also includes additional product candidates and is the first of its kind to combine multiple human antibodies in each product candidate to target a broad spectrum of the most toxic botulinum toxins  including the three most toxic serotypes  types a  b and e 
the antibodies are designed to bind to each toxin and enhance the clearance of the toxin from the body 
the use of multiple antibodies increases the likelihood of clearing the harmful toxins by providing specific protection against each toxin type 
in contrast to existing agents that treat botulism  xoma uses advanced human monoclonal antibody technologies in an effort to achieve superior safety  potency and efficacy and avoid life threatening immune reactions associated with animal derived products 
all volunteers have been enrolled and dosed with xoma ab in a phase clinical trial sponsored by niaid 
xoma is a topical anti bacterial formulation of a peptide derived from bactericidal permeability increasing protein bpi  an integral part of the protective human immune system 
in  xoma entered into a license agreement with margaux biologics  inc margaux  under which xoma transferred its rights  title  and interest in bpi 
as consideration for the transferred assets and licenses  margaux issued to xoma shares of its common stock  representing an amount of capital stock equal to of the outstanding capital stock of margaux 
under the terms of this agreement  we may receive milestone payments aggregating up to million and low to mid single digit royalties on future sales of products subject to this license 
preclinical product pipeline we are pursuing additional opportunities to further broaden our preclinical product pipeline  including internal discovery programs 
partnership products historically  we have provided research and development collaboration services for world class organizations  such as novartis and takeda  in pursuit of new antibody products 
in more recent years  we have evolved our business focus from a service provider model to a proprietary product development model 
however  we will continue to capitalize on partnered product arrangements as opportunities arise 
below is a list of such partnerships therapeutic antibodies with takeda since  takeda has been a collaboration partner for therapeutic monoclonal antibody discovery and development against multiple targets selected by them 
in february  we expanded our existing collaboration to provide takeda with access to multiple antibody technologies  including a suite of research and development technologies and integrated information and data management systems 
we may receive potential milestones and royalties on sales of antibody products in the future 
therapeutic antibodies with novartis in november  we restructured our product development collaboration with novartis  which was entered into in with novartis then chiron corporation 
under the restructured agreement  novartis received control over the two ongoing programs 
we may  in the future  receive milestones and or double digit royalty rates for the programs and options to develop or receive royalties from four additional programs 

table of contents technologies and technology licenses we have a unique set of antibody discovery  optimization and development technologies  including adapt antibody discovery advanced platform technologies proprietary phage display libraries integrated with yeast and mammalian display to enable antibody discovery  modulx technology that enables positive and negative modulation of biological pathways using allosterically modulating antibodies  and optimx technologies used for optimizing biophysical properties of antibodies  including affinity  immunogenicity  stability and manufacturability 
technology licenses below is a summary of certain proprietary technologies owned by us and available for licensing to other companies antibody discovery technologies we use human antibody phage display libraries  integrated with yeast and mammalian display adapt integrated display  in our discovery of therapeutic candidates  and we offer access to this platform  including novel phage libraries developed internally  as part of our collaboration business 
we believe access to adapt integrated display offers a number of benefits to us and our collaboration partners because it enables us to combine the diversity of phage libraries with accelerated discovery due to rapid igg reformatting and facs based screening using yeast and mammalian display 
this increases the probability of technical and business success in finding rare and unique functional antibodies directed to targets of interest 
modulx technology modulx technology allows modulation of biological pathways using monoclonal antibodies and offers insights into regulation of signaling pathways  homeostatic control  and disease biology 
using modulx  xoma is generating product candidates with novel mechanisms of action that specifically alter the kinetics of interaction between molecular constituents eg receptor ligand 
modulx technology enables expanded target and therapeutic options and offers a unique approach in the treatment of disease 
optimx technologies human engineering he he is a proprietary humanization technology that allows modification of non human monoclonal antibodies to reduce or eliminate detectable immunogenicity and make them suitable for medical purposes in humans 
the technology uses a unique method developed by us  based on analysis of the conserved structure function relationships among antibodies 
the method defines which residues in a non human variable region are candidates to be modified 
the result is an he antibody with preserved antigen binding  structure and function that has eliminated or greatly reduced immunogenicity 
he technology was used in development of gevokizumab and is used in the development of certain other antibody products 
targeted affinity enhancement tae tae is a proprietary technology involving the assessment and guided substitution of amino acids in antibody variable regions  enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity and selectivity modulation 
tae generates a comprehensive map of the effects of amino acid mutations in the cdr region likely to impact binding 
the technology is utilized by xoma scientists and has been licensed to a number of our collaborators 
bacterial cell expression the production or expression of antibodies using bacteria is an enabling technology for the discovery and selection  as well as the development and manufacture  of recombinant protein pharmaceuticals  including diagnostic and therapeutic antibodies for commercial purposes 
genetically engineered bacteria are used in the recombinant expression of target proteins for biopharmaceutical research and development  primarily due to the relative simplicity of gene expression in bacteria  as well as many years of experience culturing species  including e 
coli  in laboratories and manufacturing facilities 
our scientists have developed bacterial expression technologies to produce antibodies and other recombinant protein products 
we have granted more than licenses to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to use our patented and proprietary technologies relating to bacterial expression of recombinant pharmaceutical products 
bacterial antibody expression is also a key technology used in multiple systems for high throughput screening of antibody domains 
expression of antibodies by phage display technology  for example  depends upon the expression and secretion of antibody domains from bacteria as properly folded  functional proteins

in january  we announced we will complete niaid biodefense contracts currently in place but will not actively pursue future contracts 
should the government choose to acquire xoma ab or other biodefense products in the future  we expect to be able to provide these antibodies through an outside manufacturer 
servier us perindopril franchise on january   we announced we had acquired certain us rights to a portfolio of antihypertensive products from servier 
the portfolio includes aceon perindopril erbumine  a currently marketed angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor  and three fdc product candidates where a form of proprietary perindopril perindopril arginine is combined with another active ingredient s 
we assumed commercialization activities for aceon in january in november  we announced an patient phase study we conducted with perindopril arginine and amlodipine besylate fdc had demonstrated statistically superior reductions in sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure after six weeks of treatment than either compound alone 
partial funding for the trial was provided by servier  the balance of study expenses  consisting primarily of costs generated by our contract research organization  is expected to be paid over time from the profits generated by our aceon sales 
we are working to identify a third party organization that can sublicense this fdc and move it forward toward commercialization in the us market 
in connection with this arrangement  we paid a million license fee to servier in the third quarter of we are required to pay a royalty on aceon sales at a rate that is tiered based on sales levels and ranges from a mid single digit to a mid teen percentage rate 
if approved  we will pay a royalty on sales of the fdc product candidates in the mid teen percentage rate 
the fdc royalty rate is subject to reduction in the event of generic competition or if other intellectual property rights are required 
we may be required to pay the following milestones development milestones aggregating million assuming we exercise our options on the additional fdc product candidates and sales milestones of up to an aggregate million  in each case for all of the fdc product candidates 
we also may be required to make certain additional payments if the fdc product candidates receive fda approval but certain minimum sales levels are not reached 
we generally will be responsible for its development and commercialization expenses  however  servier partially funded development of fdc by its terms  the arrangement  including our obligation to pay royalties and or development and sales milestones  will continue until the later of july or the expiration of the last to expire servier patent licensed to us under the arrangement  unless terminated earlier 
the agreement contains customary termination rights relating to matters  such as material breach by either party  insolvency of either party or safety issues 
each party has the right to terminate the arrangement if the fdc does not receive fda approval by december  servier also has the right to terminate the arrangement if certain aspects of our commercialization strategy are not successful and servier does not consent to an alternative strategy or  as to the fdc product candidates  if we breach our obligations to certain of our service providers

general electric capital corporation term loan in december  we entered into a loan agreement the gecc loan agreement with general electric capital corporation gecc  under which gecc agreed to make a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million the term loan to us  and upon execution of the gecc loan agreement  gecc funded the term loan 
as security for our obligations under the gecc loan agreement  we granted a security interest in substantially all of our existing and after acquired assets  excluding its intellectual property assets such as those relating to our gevokizumab and anti botulism products 
the term loan accrued interest at a fixed rate of per annum and was to be repaid over a period of consecutive equal monthly installments of principal and accrued interest and was due and payable in full on june  we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately million in connection with the term loan and were required to pay a final payment fee equal to  on the maturity date  or such earlier date as the term loan is paid in full 
the debt issuance costs and final payment fee were being amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest expense over the term of the term loan using the effective interest method 
in connection with the gecc loan agreement  we issued to gecc unregistered warrants that entitle gecc to purchase up to an aggregate of  unregistered shares of xoma common stock at an exercise price equal to per share 
these warrants are exercisable immediately and have a five year term 
we allocated the aggregate proceeds of the gecc term loan between the warrants and the debt obligation based on their relative fair values 
the fair value of the warrants issued to gecc was determined using the black scholes model 
the warrants fair value of million was recorded as a discount to the debt obligation and was being amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
in september  we entered into an amendment to the gecc loan agreement providing for an additional term loan in the amount of million  increasing the term loan obligation to million the amended term loan and providing for an interest only monthly repayment period following the effective date of the amendment through march   at a stated interest rate of per annum

in connection with the amendment  on september  we issued to gecc unregistered stock purchase warrants  which entitle gecc to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of xoma common stock at an exercise price equal to per share 
these warrants are exercisable immediately and have a five year term 
the warrants fair value of million was recorded as a discount to the debt obligation and is being amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
the warrants are classified in permanent equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheets 
the amended term loan does not change the remaining terms of the gecc loan agreement 
the gecc loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  dispose of assets  enter into transactions with affiliates and amend existing material agreements  in each case subject to various exceptions

competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to continuous and substantial technological change 
competition in antibody based technologies is intense and is expected to increase as new technologies emerge and established biotechnology firms and large chemical and pharmaceutical companies continue to advance in the field 
a number of these large pharmaceutical and chemical companies have enhanced their capabilities by entering into arrangements with or acquiring biotechnology companies or entering into business combinations with other large pharmaceutical companies 
many of these companies have significantly greater financial resources  larger research and development and marketing staffs and larger production facilities than ours 
moreover  certain of these companies have extensive experience in undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials 
these factors may enable other companies to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to ours 
in addition  a significant amount of research in biotechnology is being carried out in universities and other non profit research organizations 
these entities are becoming increasingly interested in the commercial value of their work and may become more aggressive in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements 
furthermore  many companies and universities tend not to announce or disclose important discoveries or development programs until their patent position is secure or  for other reasons  later 
as a result  we may not be able to track development of competitive products  particularly at the early stages 
there can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive 
the ace inhibitor market is highly genericized with most treatment options available generically 
the number one product within the ace inhibitor category is lisinopril  formerly marketed by astra zeneca pharmaceuticals lp under the brands zestril or prinivil 
ace inhibitors represent the largest category of anti hypertensive medications and are considered a first line treatment option by the majority of the medical guidelines 
there are multiple options in the fdc market combining ace inhibitors with diuretics  but there are few options combining an ace inhibitor with a calcium channel blocker 
current options with a calcium channel blocker are benazepril amlodipine  formerly marketed by novartis pharmaceuticals as lotrel  and trandolapril verapamil  formerly marketed by abbot laboratories as tarka 

table of contents ace inhibitors are a segment of the larger renin angiotensin aldosterone system  or raas market 
this market is comprised of ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arb 
both classes act on the raas in different ways to control blood pressure 
the most successful of the arbs is valsartan  trade name diovan  which is marketed by novartis 
this compound  along with other arbs  has been developed in multiple fdc products with a diuretic  a calcium channel blocker amlodipine and as a triple combining all three 
our perindopril fdc franchise  if approved  will compete directly with fdcs containing an ace inhibitor and secondarily with fdcs containing an arb 
without limiting the foregoing  we are aware of the following competitors for the products and candidates shown in the table below 
this table is not intended to be representative of all existing competitors in the market product candidate competitors gevokizumab abbott biovitrum ab eli lilly and company lux biosciences  inc medimmune novartis ag regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc santen pharmaceutical co  ltd

daiichi sankyo  inc xoma ab cangene corporation emergent biosolutions  inc government regulation the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development  pre market approval  manufacture  marketing and distribution of biopharmaceutical products 
these agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing  approval  manufacture  quality control  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  recordkeeping  advertising and promotion of products and product candidates 
failure to comply with applicable fda or other regulatory requirements may result in warning letters  civil or criminal penalties  suspension or delays in clinical development  recall or seizure of products  partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market 
the development and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
we must obtain approval of our product candidates from the fda before we can begin marketing them in the united states 
similar approvals are also required in other countries 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
the nature and extent of the governmental review process for our product candidates will vary  depending on the regulatory categorization of particular product candidates and various other factors 
the necessary steps before a new biopharmaceutical product may be sold in the united states ordinarily include preclinical in vitro and in vivo tests  which must comply with good laboratory practices  or glp  submission to the fda of an ind which must become effective before clinical trials may commence  and which must be updated annually with a report on development  completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use  
table of contents submission to the fda of a new drug application  or nda  or a biologics license application  or bla  which must often be accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee  fda pre approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for current good manufacturing practices  or gmp  compliance and fda inspection of select clinical trial sites for good clinical practice  or gcp  compliance  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla and product prescribing information prior to any commercial sale 
the results of preclinical tests which include laboratory evaluation as well as preclinical glp studies to evaluate toxicity for a particular product candidate  together with related manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted as part of an ind to the fda 
the ind automatically becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within the day time period  raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial  including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin 
ind submissions may not result in fda authorization to commence a clinical trial 
a separate submission to an existing ind must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development 
further  an independent institutional review board  or irb  for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed 
the fda  the irb or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
clinical testing also must satisfy extensive gcp regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information 
clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or in some instances  be skipped 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the product into humans  the product is tested to assess safety  metabolism  pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific  targeted indications  determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks 
phase iii and pivotal trials are undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy and safety often in comparison to standard therapies within a broader patient population  generally at geographically dispersed clinical sites 
phase iv  or post marketing  trials may be required as a condition of commercial approval by the fda and may also be voluntarily initiated by us or our collaborators 
phase i  phase ii or phase iii testing may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time  if at all  with respect to any of our product candidates 
similarly  suggestions of safety  tolerability or efficacy in earlier stage trials do not necessarily predict findings of safety and effectiveness in subsequent trials 
furthermore  the fda  an irb or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements  such as on www 
clinicaltrials 
gov 
the results of preclinical studies  pharmaceutical development and clinical trials  together with information on a product s chemistry  manufacturing  and controls  are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda or bla  for approval of the manufacture  marketing and commercial shipment of the pharmaceutical product 
data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data 
the fda may also convene an advisory committee of external advisors to answer questions regarding the approvability and labeling of an application 
the fda is not obligated to follow the advisory committee s recommendation 
the submission of an nda or bla is required to be accompanied by a substantial user fee  with few exceptions or waivers 
the user fee is administered under the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  which sets goals for the timeliness of the fda s review 
a standard review period is twelve months from submission of the application  while priority review is eight months from submission of the application 
the testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time  effort and resources  and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda may deny review of an application by refusing to file the application or not approve an application by issuance of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  require additional testing or information  or require risk management programs and post market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product 
approval may occur with significant risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  or rems  which limit the clinical use in the prescribing information  distribution or promotion of a product 
once issued  the fda may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market 

table of contents orphan drugs are those intended for use in rare diseases or conditions 
as a result of the high cost of development and the low return on investment for rare diseases  governments provide regulatory and commercial incentives for the development of drugs for small disease populations 
in the us  the term rare disease or condition means any disease or condition that affects fewer than  persons in the us applications for united states orphan drug status are evaluated and granted by the office of orphan products development oopd of the fda  and must be requested before submitting an nda or bla 
in the us  orphan drugs are subject to the standard regulatory process for marketing approval but are exempt from the payment of user fees for licensure  may receive market exclusivity for a period of seven years and some tax benefits  and are eligible for oopd grants 
if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity  which means that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication  except in very limited circumstances  for seven years 
competitors  however  may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity 
orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the fda or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor s product for the same indication or disease 
if a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated  it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity 
products manufactured or distributed pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including manufacture  labeling  advertising  distribution  advertising  promotion  recordkeeping  annual product quality review and reporting requirements 
adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the fda in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the fda 
manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements  including cgmps  which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities 
a form notice  if issued at the conclusion of an fda inspection  can list conditions the fda investigators believe may have violated cgmp or other fda regulations or guidance 
failure to adequately and promptly correct the observations s can result in further regulatory enforcement action 
in addition to form notices and warning letters  failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product  injunctive action or possible civil penalties 
we cannot be certain that we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cgmp regulations and other ongoing fda regulatory requirements 
if we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements  the fda may halt our clinical trials  not approve our products  require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the bla or nda for that product 
failure to comply with ongoing regulatory obligations can result in delay of approval or warning letters  product seizures  criminal penalties  and withdrawal of approved products  among other enforcement remedies 
the fda strictly regulates marketing  labeling  advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market 
these regulations include standards and restrictions for direct to consumer advertising  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities  promotional activities involving the internet  and off label promotion 
while physicians may prescribe for off label uses  manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label 
the fda has very broad enforcement authority under the fdca  and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties  including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from fda standards  and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions 
federal and state healthcare laws  including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws  are also applicable to our business 
we could face substantial penalties and our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected 
the laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal anti kickback statute  which prohibits soliciting  receiving  offering or paying remuneration  directly or indirectly  to induce  or in return for  the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program  such as the medicare and medicaid programs  federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws  which prohibit  among other things  individuals or entities from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment from medicare  medicaid  or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent  and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters and was amended by the health information technology and clinical health act  or hitech  and its implementing regulations  which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy  security and transmission of individually identifiable health information 
state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws exist  many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect  thus complicating compliance efforts 
international regulation in addition to regulations in the us  we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any future products 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 

table of contents third party payor coverage and reimbursement the commercial success of aceon and our product candidates  if approved  will depend  in part  upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payors at the federal  state and private levels 
government payor programs  including medicare and medicaid  private health care insurance companies and managed care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments 
the us congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment 
ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care will likely continue to focus on health care reform  the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid payment systems 
while we cannot predict whether any proposed cost containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future  the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices and operate profitably 
patents and trade secrets patent and trade secret protection are important to our business and our future will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
as a result of our ongoing activities  we hold and have filed applications for a number of patents in the us and internationally to protect our products and important processes 
we also have obtained or have the right to obtain exclusive licenses to certain patents and applications filed by others 
however  the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and consistent policy regarding the breadth of allowed claims has not emerged from the actions of the us patent and trademark office patent office with respect to biotechnology patents 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that our patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technologies or others will not obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patent applications 
we have established a portfolio of patents in the us  europe and certain other countries for our gevokizumab program  the longest of which expires in us patent nos 
 and  cover gevokizumab and other antibodies and antibody fragments with similar binding properties for il beta  as well as nucleic acids  expression vectors and production cell lines for the manufacture of such antibodies and antibody fragments 
us patent nos

table of contents we also have established a portfolio of patents related to our mammalian expression technology  including us patent nos 
  and  which relate to methods of producing recombinant proteins using particular vectors  including expression vectors comprising multiple copies of a transcription unit encoding a polypeptide separated by at least one selective marker gene 
we have established a portfolio of patents related to our human engineering technology  including us patent no 
 directed to methods of modifying antibody variable domains to reduce immunogenicity 
we believe our patented human engineering technology provides an attractive alternative to other humanization technologies 
if certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others issue and are upheld  we may require certain licenses from others in order to develop and commercialize certain potential products incorporating our technology 
there can be no assurance that such licenses  if required  will be available on acceptable terms 
where appropriate  we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and collaborators 
these parties may breach these agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that we or our consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others  we may have disputes with our collaborators or consultants or other third parties as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
international operations we believe  because the pharmaceutical industry is global in nature  international activities will be a significant part of our future business activities and  when and if we are able to generate income  a substantial portion of that income may be derived from product sales and other activities outside the us as our strategic goal is to establish xoma as a commercial organization in the us  we will rely upon other companies to market our product outside of the us for the foreseeable future 
our decision to retain the us commercial rights to our product candidates while licensing the rights to our product candidates outside the us  or to license our product candidates globally to one or more partners  depends upon a number of factors  including the primary indication and size of the potential patient population  the size of the clinical trials required to obtain marketing approval in the us and globally  and the size of the sales force required to sell the product 
a number of risks are inherent in international operations 
foreign regulatory agencies often establish standards different from those in the us an inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on our international business  financial condition and results of operations 
international operations may be limited or disrupted by the imposition of government controls  export license requirements  political or economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  restrictions on repatriating profits  taxation or difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
in addition  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully operate in any foreign market

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
because our product candidates are still being developed  we will require substantial funds to continue  we cannot be certain that funds will be available  and if they are not available  we may have to take actions that could adversely affect the price of our common stock and may not be able to continue operations 
we will need to commit substantial funds to continue development of our product candidates  and we may not be able to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our product candidates  grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or enter into a collaboration arrangement for a product candidate at an earlier stage of development or for a lesser amount than we might otherwise choose 
additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on a timely basis  we may terminate or delay clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates  further reduce our headcount and capital or operating expenditures  or curtail our spending on protecting our intellectual property 
we finance our operations primarily through our multiple revenue streams resulting from discovery and development collaborations  biodefense contracts  the licensing of our antibody technologies  and sales of our common stock 
in august  we sold our royalty interest in cimzia for gross proceeds of million  including royalty revenue from the second quarter of as a result  we no longer have a royalty interest in cimzia 
we received revenue from this royalty interest of million in and million in based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december   anticipated spending levels  anticipated cash inflows from collaborations  biodefense contracts and licensing transactions  funding availability including under our loan agreements  and the proceeds from the october public offering  we believe we have sufficient cash resources to meet our anticipated net cash needs into the fourth quarter of any significant revenue shortfalls  increases in planned spending on development programs  more rapid progress of development programs than anticipated  or the initiation of new clinical trials  as well as the unavailability of anticipated sources of funding  could shorten this period or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our ability to finance our continued operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we will be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product development programs and further reduce personnel related costs 
progress or setbacks by potentially competing products also may affect our ability to raise new funding on acceptable terms 
as a result  we do not know when or whether operations will generate meaningful funds  additional agreements for product development funding can be reached  strategic alliances can be negotiated  or adequate additional financing will be available for us to finance our own development on acceptable terms  or at all 
because all of our product candidates still are being developed  we have sustained losses in the past  and we expect to sustain losses in the future 
we have experienced significant losses  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of approximately million  or per share of common stock basic and diluted 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of approximately million  or per share of common stock basic and diluted 

table of contents our ability to achieve profitability is dependent in large part on the success of our development programs  obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates and licensing certain of our preclinical compounds  all of which are uncertain 
our ability to fund our ongoing operations is dependent on the foregoing factors and on our ability to secure additional funds 
because our product candidates still are being developed  we do not know whether we will ever achieve sustained profitability or whether cash flow from future operations will be sufficient to meet our needs 
we are substantially dependent on servier for the development and commercialization of gevokizumab and for other aspects of our business  and if we are unable to maintain our relationship with servier  or servier does not perform under our development and commercialization agreements with servier  our business would be harmed significantly 
we have a number of agreements with servier that are material to the conduct of our business  including in december  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with servier  to jointly develop and commercialize gevokizumab in multiple indications 
under the terms of the agreement  servier has worldwide rights to cardiovascular disease and diabetes indications and rights outside the united states and japan to all other indications  including beh et s uveitis and other inflammatory and oncology indications 
in late  we announced servier agreed to include the niu phase trials under the terms of the collaboration agreement for beh et s uveitis 
we retain development and commercialization rights for niu and other inflammatory disease and oncology indications in the united states and japan and have an option to reacquire rights to cardiovascular disease and diabetes indications from servier in these territories 
should we exercise this option  we will be required to pay an option fee to servier and partially reimburse a specified portion of servier s incurred development expenses 
the agreement contains mutual customary termination rights relating to matters  such as material breach by either party 
servier may terminate for safety issues  and we may terminate the agreement  with respect to a particular country or the european patent organization epo member states  for any challenge to our patent rights in that country or any epo member state  respectively  by servier 
servier also has a unilateral right to terminate the agreement for the european union eu or for non eu countries  on a country by country basis  or in its entirety  in each case with six months notice 
in december  we entered into a loan agreement with servier the servier loan agreement  which provides for an advance of up to million and was funded fully in january with the proceeds converting to approximately million at the january   euro to us dollar exchange rate of 
this loan is secured by an interest in our intellectual property rights to all gevokizumab indications worldwide  excluding the united states and japan 
the loan has a final maturity date in  however  after a specified period prior to final maturity  the loan is required to be repaid at servier s option  by applying up to a significant percentage of any milestone or royalty payments owed by servier under our collaboration agreement and using a significant percentage of any upfront  milestone or royalty payments we receive from any third party collaboration or development partner for rights to gevokizumab in the united states and or japan 
in addition  the loan becomes immediately due and payable upon certain customary events of default 
at december   the million outstanding principal balance under this servier loan agreement would have equaled approximately million using the december  euro to us dollar exchange rate of effective in january  we entered into an amended and restated agreement with servier for the united states commercialization rights to aceon and  upon exercise by us of an option with respect to each product  a portfolio of additional fdc product candidates where perindopril is combined with another active ingredient s  such as a calcium channel blocker 
to date we have exercised this option with respect to one fdc product 
this agreement  together with a related trademark license agreement  provides us with exclusive us rights to aceon and fdc  and options on additional fdcs 
the arrangement also provides that servier will supply to us  and we will purchase exclusively from servier  the active ingredients in aceon and the fdcs  in some cases for a limited period 
the agreement contains customary termination rights relating to matters  such as material breach by  or insolvency of  either party or  as to particular licensed products  for safety issues arising with respect to such products 
each party also has the right to terminate the arrangement if fdc does not receive fda approval by december  servier also has the right to terminate the arrangement if certain aspects of our commercialization strategy are not successful and servier does not consent to an alternative strategy  or as to the fdcs  if we breach our obligations to certain of our service providers 
further  servier also may terminate the agreement if we fail to achieve certain levels of sales of products and do not make a specified payment in such circumstances to maintain our license  or under certain circumstances upon our change in control  if we fail to take certain actions or make certain payments 
because servier is an independent third party  it may be subject to different risks than we are and has significant discretion in  and different criteria for  determining the efforts and resources it will apply related to its agreements with us 
even though we have a collaborative relationship with servier  our relationship could deteriorate or other circumstances may prevent our relationship with servier from resulting in successful development of marketable products 
if we are not able to maintain our working relationship with servier  or if servier does not perform under our agreements with servier  our ability to develop and commercialize gevokizumab and the fdcs would be materially and adversely affected  as would our ability to commercialize aceon 

table of contents we have received negative results from certain of our clinical trials  and we face uncertain results of other clinical trials of our product candidates 
drug development has inherent risk  and we are required to demonstrate through adequate and well controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are effective  with a favorable benefit risk profile for use in their target profiles before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial use 
it is possible we may never receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval  the resulting product may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community 
in march  we announced our patient phase b trial of gevokizumab in type diabetes did not achieve the primary endpoint of reduction in hemoglobin ac hbac after six monthly treatments with gevokizumab compared to placebo 
in june  we announced top line trial results from our six month patient phase a trial of gevokizumab in type diabetes  and there were no differences in glycemic control between the drug and placebo groups as measured by hbac levels 
many of our product candidates  including gevokizumab  xmet  and xoma ab  require significant additional research and development  extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales 
this process is lengthy and expensive  often taking a number of years 
as clinical results frequently are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals  the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly 
as a result  it is uncertain whether our future filings will be delayed  our preclinical and clinical studies will be successful  we will be successful in generating viable product candidates to targets  we will be able to provide necessary additional data  results of future clinical trials will justify further development  or we ultimately will achieve regulatory approval for any of these product candidates 
the timing of the commencement  continuation and completion of clinical trials may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes  including completion of preclinical testing and earlier stage clinical trials in a timely manner  engaging contract research organizations and other service providers  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria  and shortages of available drug supply 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial  the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments 
regardless of the initial size or relative complexity of a clinical trial  the costs of such trial may be higher than expected due to increases in duration or size of the trial  changes in the protocol pursuant to which the trial is being conducted  additional or special requirements of one or more of the healthcare centers where the trial is being conducted  or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the trial or in the standards or guidelines for approval of the product candidate being tested or for other unforeseen reasons 
in addition  we conduct clinical trials in foreign countries  which may subject us to further delays and expenses as a result of increased drug shipment costs  additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of foreign clinical research organizations  as well as expose us to risks associated with foreign currency transactions insofar as we might desire to use us dollars to make contract payments denominated in the foreign currency where the trial is being conducted 
all of our product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development 
preclinical studies may not yield results that satisfactorily support the filing of an investigational new drug application ind or a foreign equivalent with respect to our product candidates 
even if these applications would be or have been filed with respect to our product candidates  the results of preclinical studies do not necessarily predict the results of clinical trials 
similarly  early stage clinical trials in healthy volunteers do not predict the results of later stage clinical trials  including the safety and efficacy profiles of any particular product candidates 
in addition  there can be no assurance the design of our clinical trials is focused on appropriate indications  patient populations  dosing regimens or other variables that will result in obtaining the desired efficacy data to support regulatory approval to commercialize the drug 
preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways 
accordingly  fda officials or officials from foreign regulatory authorities could interpret the data differently than we or our collaboration or development partners do  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 

table of contents administering any of our products or potential products may produce undesirable side effects  also known as adverse effects 
toxicities and adverse effects that we have observed in preclinical studies for some compounds in a particular research and development program may occur in preclinical studies or clinical trials of other compounds from the same program 
such toxicities or adverse effects could delay or prevent the filing of an ind or a foreign equivalent with respect to such products or potential products or cause us to cease clinical trials with respect to any drug candidate 
in clinical trials  administering any of our products or product candidates to humans may produce adverse effects 
these adverse effects could interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of our products and product candidates and could result in the fda or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our products or product candidates for any or all targeted indications 
the fda  other regulatory authorities  our collaboration or development partners or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time 
even if one or more of our product candidates were approved for sale  the occurrence of even a limited number of toxicities or adverse effects when used in large populations may cause the fda to impose restrictions on  or stop  the further marketing of such drugs 
indications of potential adverse effects or toxicities that may occur in clinical trials and that we believe are not significant during the course of such clinical trials may actually turn out later to constitute serious adverse effects or toxicities when a drug has been used in large populations or for extended periods of time 
any failure or significant delay in completing preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates  or in receiving and maintaining regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our product candidates  may severely harm our reputation and business 
in june  novartis announced an advisory committee of the fda had voted in favor of the overall efficacy but not the overall safety of ilaris canakinumab  a fully human monoclonal antibody that  like gevokizumab  targets il beta  to treat gouty arthritis attacks in patients who cannot obtain adequate relief with non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or colchicine 
ilaris was initially approved in june for cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes  an orphan indication 
novartis also stated that in two pivotal phase studies of canakinumab in gouty arthritis patients  a higher percentage of patients had adverse events with canakinumab than with the standard treatment for gouty arthritis  and more serious adverse events were reported by patients treated with canakinumab compared to patients receiving the standard treatment 
in august  novartis announced the fda had issued a complete response letter requesting additional information  including clinical data to evaluate the benefit risk profile of canakinumab in refractory gouty arthritis patients 
we have not yet determined what impact  if any  these developments may have on the development of gevokizumab 
if our therapeutic product candidates do not receive regulatory approval  neither our third party collaborators  our contract manufacturers nor we will be able to manufacture and market them 
our product candidates including gevokizumab  fdc  xmeta  xmetd  xmets  and xoma ab cannot be manufactured and marketed in the united states or any other countries without required regulatory approvals 
the united states government and governments of other countries extensively regulate many aspects of our product candidates  including clinical development and testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  record keeping  promotion and marketing  and importing and exporting 
in the united states  the fda regulates pharmaceutical products under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and other laws  including  in the case of biologics  the public health service act 
at the present time  we believe many of our product candidates including gevokizumab  xmeta  xmetd  xmets  and xoma ab will be regulated by the fda as biologics and some of our product candidates including fdc will be regulated by the fda as drugs 
initiation of clinical trials requires approval by health authorities 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with fda and international conference on harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use good clinical practices and the european clinical trials directive under protocols that detail the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
other national  foreign and local regulations also may apply 
the developer of the drug must provide information relating to the characterization and controls of the product before administration to the patients participating in the clinical trials 
this requires developing approved assays of the product to test before administration to the patient and during the conduct of the trial 
in addition  developers of pharmaceutical products must provide periodic data regarding clinical trials to the fda and other health authorities  and these health authorities may issue a clinical hold upon a trial if they do not believe  or cannot confirm  that the trial can be conducted without unreasonable risk to the trial participants 
we cannot assure you that us and foreign health authorities will not issue a clinical hold with respect to any of our clinical trials in the future 

table of contents the results of the preclinical studies and clinical testing  together with chemistry  manufacturing and controls information  are submitted to the fda and other health authorities in the form of an nda for a drug  and in the form of a biologic license application bla for a biological product  requesting approval to commence commercial sales 
in responding to an nda or bla  the fda or foreign health authorities may grant marketing approvals  request additional information or further research  or deny the application if it determines the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
regulatory approval of an nda  bla  or supplement never is guaranteed  the approval process can take several years  is extremely expensive and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity  and novelty of the products involved  as well as the target indications 
fda regulations and policies permit applicants to request accelerated or priority review pathways for products intended to treat certain serious or life threatening illnesses in certain circumstances 
if granted by the fda  these review pathways can provide a shortened timeline to commercialize the product  although the shortened review timeline is often accompanied with additional post market requirements 
although we may pursue the fda s accelerated or priority review programs  we cannot guarantee the fda will permit us to utilize these pathways or the fda s review of our application will not be delayed 
moreover  even if the fda agrees to an accelerated or priority review of any of our applications  we may not ultimately be able to obtain approval of our application in a timely fashion or at all 
the fda and foreign health authorities have substantial discretion in the drug and biologics approval processes 
despite the time and expense incurred  failure can occur at any stage  and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical  clinical or manufacturing related studies 
changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period  changes in  or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes  or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application 
state regulations may also affect our proposed products 
the fda and other regulatory agencies have substantial discretion in both the product approval process and manufacturing facility approval process  and as a result of this discretion and uncertainties about outcomes of testing  we cannot predict at what point  or whether  the fda or other regulatory agencies will be satisfied with our or our collaborators submissions or whether the fda or other regulatory agencies will raise questions that may be material and delay or preclude product approval or manufacturing facility approval 
in light of this discretion and the complexities of the scientific  medical and regulatory environment  our interpretation or understanding of the fda s or other regulatory agencies requirements  guidelines or expectations may prove incorrect  which also could delay further or increase the cost of the approval process 
as we accumulate additional clinical data  we will submit it to the fda and other regulatory agencies  as appropriate  and such data may have a material impact on the approval process 
given that regulatory review is an interactive and continuous process  we maintain a policy of limiting announcements and comments upon the specific details of regulatory review of our product candidates  subject to our obligations under the securities laws  until definitive action is taken 
we rely on third parties to provide services in connection with our product candidate development and manufacturing programs 
the inadequate performance by or loss of any of these service providers could affect our product candidate development 
several third parties provide services in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  including in vitro and in vivo studies  assay and reagent development  immunohistochemistry  toxicology  pharmacokinetics  clinical trial support  manufacturing and other outsourced activities 
if these service providers do not adequately perform the services for which we have contracted or cease to continue operations and we are not able to find a replacement provider quickly or we lose information or items associated with our product candidates  our development programs may be delayed 
in particular  we have a master services agreement with a contract research organization that provides the majority of our clinical trial services with respect to our collaboration with servier in relation to the fdc products 
under this agreement  which was amended in october  we are obligated to fund the clinical trial services provided by the contract research organization by allocating a specified portion of the revenue received from sales of aceon 
if we do not receive sufficient revenue from sales of aceon to fund such services  and we do not otherwise pay the contract research organization for these services  certain of our rights under the commercialization agreement with servier may terminate  unless servier elects to make such payments on our behalf  in which case we will be required to reimburse servier for such payments within a specified timeframe 
certain rights under the commercialization agreement with servier also will terminate if we fail to reimburse servier within such period 
we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity  or we may not receive the full benefit of orphan drug exclusivity even if we obtain such exclusivity 
the fda has awarded orphan drug status to gevokizumab for the treatment of non infectious  intermediate  posterior or pan uveitis  and chronic non infectious anterior uveitis and beh et s uveitis 
under the orphan drug act  the first company to receive fda approval for gevokizumab for the designated orphan drug indication will obtain seven years of marketing exclusivity  during which time the fda may not approve another company s application for gevokizumab for the same orphan indication 
even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain indications for gevokizumab and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for our future product candidates or other indications  due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products  we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication  or we may not obtain approval for an indication for which we have obtained orphan drug designation 
further  even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product  that exclusivity may not protect the product effectively from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition 
even after an orphan drug is approved  the fda can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is safer  more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care 
orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug  nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process 

table of contents even after fda approval  a product may be subject to additional testing or significant marketing restrictions  its approval may be withdrawn or it may be removed voluntarily from the market 
even if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing regulatory oversight and review by the fda and other regulatory entities 
the fda  the european commission or another regulatory agency may impose  as a condition of the approval  ongoing requirements for post approval studies or post approval obligations  including additional research and development and clinical trials  and the fda  european commission or other regulatory agency subsequently may withdraw approval based on these additional trials 
as the current holder of the aceon nda  we are required to submit annual reports to the fda and are responsible for pharmacovigilance activities related to the product 
even for approved products  the fda  european commission or other regulatory agency may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses  conditions for use  labeling  advertising  promotion  marketing and or production of such product 
in addition  the labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping for our products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
furthermore  a marketing approval of a product may be withdrawn by the fda  the european commission or another regulatory agency or such a product may be withdrawn voluntarily by the company marketing it based  for example  on subsequently arising safety concerns 
in february  the european medicines agency ema announced it had recommended suspension of the marketing authorization of raptiva in the eu and its committee for medicinal products for human use chmp had concluded the benefits of raptiva no longer outweigh its risks because of safety concerns  including the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml in patients taking the medicine 
in the second quarter of  genentech announced and carried out a phased voluntary withdrawal of raptiva from the us market  based on the association of raptiva with an increased risk of pml 
we had participated in the development of raptiva 
the fda  european commission and other agencies also may impose various civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements  including withdrawal of product approval 
we may issue additional equity securities and thereby materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue  without stockholder approval   shares of preferred stock  of which none were issued and outstanding as of march   which may give other stockholders dividend  conversion  voting  and liquidation rights  among other rights  which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock 
in april  the  series b convertible preference shares previously issued to genentech were converted by genentech into  shares of common stock 
in addition  we are authorized to issue  generally without stockholder approval  up to  shares of common stock  of which  were issued and outstanding as of march  if we issue additional equity securities  the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected 
on february   we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement the atm agreement with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc now known as mlv co 
llc  mlv  under which we may sell shares of our common stock from time to time through the mlv  as our agent for the offer and sale of the shares  in an aggregate amount not to exceed the amount that can be sold under our registration statement on form s file no 
filed with the sec on february   and amended on march   june   and january   which was most recently declared effective by the sec on january  mlv may sell the shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in rule of the securities act  including without limitation sales made directly on the nasdaq global market  on any other existing trading market for our common stock or to or through a market maker 
mlv also may sell the shares in privately negotiated transactions  subject to our prior approval 
from the inception of the atm agreement through march   we sold a total of  shares of common stock under this agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
on march   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock  and accompanying warrants to purchase one half of a share of common stock for each share purchased  at a public offering price of per share 
total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately million  before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses totaling approximately million 
the warrants  which represent the right to acquire an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock  are exercisable immediately and have a five year term and an exercise price of per share 
as of march    of these warrants were outstanding 
on october   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock  at a public offering price of per share 
in addition  we granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock on the same terms and conditions  solely to cover over allotments  which option was not exercised within the day option period 
total gross proceeds from the offering were approximately million  before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses totaling approximately million 

table of contents the financial terms of future collaborative or licensing arrangements could result in dilution of our share value 
funding from collaboration partners and others has in the past and may in the future involve issuance by us of our shares 
we cannot be certain how the purchase price of such shares  the relevant market price or premium  if any  will be determined or when such determinations will be made 
any such issuance could result in dilution in the value of our issued and outstanding shares 
our share price may be volatile and there may not be an active trading market for our common stock 
there can be no assurance the market price of our common stock will not decline below its present market price or there will be an active trading market for our common stock 
the market prices of biotechnology companies have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile 
fluctuations in our operating results and general market conditions for biotechnology stocks could have a significant impact on the volatility of our common stock price 
we have experienced significant volatility in the price of our common stock 
from january   through march   the share price of our common stock has ranged from a high of to a low of 
factors contributing to such volatility include  but are not limited to results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  information relating to the safety or efficacy of products or product candidates  developments regarding regulatory filings  announcements of new collaborations  failure to enter into collaborations  developments in existing collaborations  our funding requirements and the terms of our financing arrangements  technological innovations or new indications for our therapeutic products and product candidates  introduction of new products or technologies by us or our competitors  sales and estimated or forecasted sales of products for which we receive royalties  if any  government regulations  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  the number of shares issued and outstanding  the number of shares trading on an average trading day  announcements regarding other participants in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  and market speculation regarding any of the foregoing 
if we are unable to continue to meet the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq global market  then we may be de listed 
in march  we received a staff determination letter from the nasdaq stock market llc nasdaq indicating we had not regained compliance with the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the nasdaq global market  pursuant to nasdaq listing rule a 
on august   we effected a reverse split of our common stock to regain compliance 
we may not be successful in commercializing our products  which could affect our development efforts 
we began commercializing our first product  aceon  in january  and we have limited experience in the sales  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain the arrangements we have with third party suppliers  distributors and other service providers that are necessary for us to perform these activities or our efforts will be successful 
maintaining or expanding these arrangements  or developing our own capabilities  may divert attention and resources from or otherwise negatively affect our development programs 
our rights to commercialize aceon are licensed from servier  and we are obligated to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize the products covered by our agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of that agreement 
our ability to satisfy some of these obligations is dependent on factors that are outside of our control 
our agreement with servier may be terminated by servier if we materially breach our obligations and fail to cure such breach  for our insolvency  or terminated by either party with respect to any individual licensed product in the event of certain safety issues are presented 
each party also has the right to terminate the agreement if fdc does not receive fda approval by december   and servier may terminate the agreement if we fail to achieve certain levels of annual net sales of products and do not make a specified payment to maintain our license 
servier also has the right to terminate the agreement if we do not meet specified commercialization objectives and servier does not consent to an alternative strategy or  as to the fdcs  if we breach our obligations to certain of our service providers 
servier also may terminate under certain circumstances upon our change in control  if we fail to take certain actions or make certain payments 
if our agreement is terminated  we would have no further rights to develop and commercialize these products 

table of contents furthermore  because we intend to use revenues generated by sales of aceon in part to fund development of fdc  lower than expected revenues from such sales could adversely affect our ability to fund the costs of  and progress  such development 
we are subject to various state and federal healthcare related laws and regulations that may impact the commercialization of aceon or our product candidates and could subject us to significant fines and penalties 
our operations may be directly or indirectly subject to various state and federal healthcare laws  including  without limitation  the federal anti kickback statute  the federal false claims act and hipaa hitech 
these laws may impact  among other things  the commercial operations for aceon or any of our product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale 
the federal anti kickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting  offering  receiving or providing remuneration  directly or indirectly  in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual  or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service  for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program  such as the medicare and medicaid programs 
several courts have interpreted the statute s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business  the statute has been violated 
the anti kickback statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry 
penalties for violations of the federal anti kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines  penalties  imprisonment and possible exclusion from medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
many states also have adopted laws similar to the federal anti kickback statute  some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source  not only the medicare and medicaid programs 
the physician payments sunshine act also has several state equivalents  which require  and under which the federal government will require in  disclosure of payments or other transfers of value we make to physicians 
the federal false claims act prohibits persons from knowingly filing  or causing to be filed  a false claim to  or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government 
suits filed under the false claims act  known as qui tam actions  can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals  commonly known as whistleblowers  may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 
the filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical  medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend a false claims act action 
when an entity is determined to have violated the false claims act  it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus civil penalties for each separate false claim 
various states also have enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act 
the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters and was amended by the health information technology and clinical health act hitech  and its implementing regulations  which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy  security and transmission of individually identifiable health information 
we take our obligation to maintain our compliance with these various laws and regulations seriously 
if we are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or other applicable state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws  we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
certain of our technologies are in licensed from third parties  so our capabilities using them are restricted and subject to additional risks 
we license technologies from third parties 
these technologies include but are not limited to phage display technologies licensed to us in connection with our bacterial cell expression technology licensing program 
however  our use of these technologies is limited by certain contractual provisions in the licenses relating to them  and although we have obtained numerous licenses  intellectual property rights in the area of phage display are particularly complex 
if the owners of the patent rights underlying the technologies that we license do not properly maintain or enforce those patents  our competitive position and business prospects could be harmed 
our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain  maintain and enforce our in licensed intellectual property 
our licensors may not be successful in prosecuting the patent applications to which we have licenses  or our licensors may fail to maintain existing patents 
they may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents  or they may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would 
our licensors also may seek to terminate our license  which could cause us to lose the right to use the licensed intellectual property and adversely affect our ability to commercialize our technologies  products or services 

table of contents we do not know whether there will be  or will continue to be  a viable market for the products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest 
even if products in which we have an interest receive approval in the future  they may not be accepted in the marketplace 
in addition  we or our collaborators or licensees may experience difficulties in launching new products  many of which are novel and based on technologies that are unfamiliar to the healthcare community 
we have no assurance healthcare providers and patients will accept such products  if developed 
for example  physicians and or patients may not accept a product for a particular indication because it has been biologically derived and not discovered and developed by more traditional means or if no biologically derived products are currently in widespread use in that indication 
similarly  physicians may not accept a product if they believe other products to be more effective or more cost effective or are more comfortable prescribing other products 
safety concerns also may arise in the course of on going clinical trials or patient treatment as a result of adverse events or reactions 
for example  in february  the ema announced it had recommended suspension of the marketing authorization of raptiva in the eu and emd serono inc  the company that marketed raptiva in canada emd serono announced that in consultation with health canada  the canadian health authority health canada  it would suspend marketing of raptiva in canada 
in march  merck serono australia pty ltd  the company that marketed raptiva in australia merck serono australia  following a recommendation from the therapeutic goods administration  the australian health authority tga  announced it was withdrawing raptiva from the australian market 
in the second quarter of  genentech announced and carried out a phased voluntary withdrawal of raptiva from the us market  based on the association of raptiva with an increased risk of pml  and sales of the product ceased 
furthermore  government agencies  as well as private organizations involved in healthcare  from time to time publish guidelines or recommendations to healthcare providers and patients 
such guidelines or recommendations can be very influential and may adversely affect product usage directly for example  by recommending a decreased dosage of a product in conjunction with a concomitant therapy or a government entity withdrawing its recommendation to screen blood donations for certain viruses or indirectly for example  by recommending a competitive product over our product 
consequently  we do not know if physicians or patients will adopt or use our products for their approved indications 
even approved and marketed products are subject to risks relating to changes in the market for such products 
introduction or increased availability of generic versions of products can alter the market acceptance of branded products  such as aceon 
in addition  unforeseen safety issues may arise at any time  regardless of the length of time a product has been on the market 
our third party collaborators  licensees  suppliers or contractors may not have adequate manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet market demand 
upon approval of any of our product candidates or in the event of increased demand for marketed products  we do not know whether the capacity of the manufacturing facilities of our existing or future third party collaborators  licensees  suppliers or contractors will be available or can be increased to produce sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand 
also  if we or our third party collaborators  licensees  suppliers or contractors need additional manufacturing facilities to meet market demand  we cannot predict that we will successfully obtain those facilities because we do not know whether they will be available on acceptable terms 
in addition  any manufacturing facilities acquired or used to meet market demand must meet the fda s quality assurance guidelines 
in addition to our agreements with servier  our agreements with other third parties  many of which are significant to our business  expose us to numerous risks 
our financial resources and our marketing experience and expertise are limited 
consequently  our ability to develop products successfully depends  to a large extent  upon securing the financial resources and or marketing capabilities of third parties other than servier 
for example in march  we announced we had agreed to collaborate with chiron corporation now novartis for the development and commercialization of antibody products for the treatment of cancer 
in april  we announced the initiation of clinical testing of the first product candidate out of the collaboration  hcd  an anti cd antibody  in patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
in october  we announced the initiation of the second clinical trial of hcd in patients with multiple myeloma 
in november  we announced the restructuring of this product development collaboration  which involved six development programs including the ongoing hcd and lfa programs 
in exchange for cash and debt reduction on our existing loan facility with novartis  novartis has control over the hcd and lfa programs  as well as the right to expand the development of these programs into additional indications outside of oncology 
in march  we entered into a contract with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid to produce three monoclonal antibodies designed to protect us citizens against the harmful effects of botulinum neurotoxin used in bioterrorism 
in july  we entered into an additional contract with niaid for the development of an appropriate formulation for human administration of these three antibodies in a single injection 
in september  we announced we had been awarded an additional contract with niaid to support our on going development of drug candidates toward clinical trials in the treatment of botulism poisoning 
in october  we announced we had been awarded an additional contract with niaid to develop broad spectrum antitoxins for the treatment of human botulism poisoning 

table of contents in december  we entered into a loan agreement with gecc the gecc loan agreement  under which gecc agreed to make a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of million to xoma us llc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and upon execution of the gecc loan agreement  gecc funded the term loan 
the term loan is guaranteed by us and our two other principal subsidiaries  xoma ireland limited and xoma technology ltd 
as security for our obligations under the gecc loan agreement  we  xoma us llc  xoma ireland limited and xoma technology ltd 
each granted a security interest pursuant to a guaranty  pledge and security agreement in substantially all of our existing and after acquired assets  excluding our intellectual property assets such as those relating to our gevokizumab and anti botulism products 
we were required to repay the principal amount of the term loan over a period of installments of principal and accrued interest  but we amended the gecc loan agreement on september   as described below 
the gecc loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  dispose of assets  enter into transactions with affiliates and amend existing material agreements  in each case subject to various exceptions 
in addition  the gecc loan agreement contains customary events of default that entitle gecc to cause any or all of the indebtedness under the gecc loan agreement to become immediately due and payable 
the events of default include any event of default under a material agreement or certain other indebtedness 
we may prepay the term loan in full voluntarily  but not in part  and any voluntary and certain mandatory prepayments are subject to a prepayment premium of in the first year of the loan  in the second year and thereafter  with certain exceptions 
we also will be required to pay the final payment fee in connection with any voluntary or mandatory prepayment 
pursuant to the gecc loan agreement  we issued to gecc unregistered stock purchase warrants  which entitle gecc to purchase up to an aggregate of  unregistered shares of xoma common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  are exercisable immediately and expire on december  on september   we entered into an amendment to the gecc loan agreement providing for an additional term loan in the amount of million and an interest only monthly repayment period with respect to the aggregate loan obligation of million outstanding following the effective date of the amendment through march   at a stated interest rate of per annum 
thereafter  we are obligated to make monthly principal payments of million  plus accrued interest  at a stated interest rate of per annum  over a month period commencing on april   and through june   at which time the remaining outstanding principal amount of million  plus accrued interest  shall be due 
a final payment fee in the amount of million is payable on the date upon which the outstanding principal amount is required to be repaid in full 
any mandatory or voluntary prepayment of the million will accelerate the due date of the final payment fee and trigger a prepayment penalty equal to of the outstanding principal amount being prepaid if prepaid on or before september   if prepaid on or before september   and if prepaid after september   but prior to the maturity date 
in connection with the amendment  on september   we issued ge a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which warrant is exercisable immediately  has a five year term and has an exercise price of per share 
we have licensed our bacterial cell expression technology  an enabling technology used to discover and screen  as well as develop and manufacture  recombinant antibodies and other proteins for commercial purposes  to over companies 
as of march   we were aware of two antibody products manufactured using this technology that have received fda approval  genentech s lucentis ranibizumab injection for treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration and ucb s cimzia certolizumab pegol for treatment of crohn s disease and rheumatoid arthritis 
in the third quarter of  we sold our lucentis royalty interest to genentech 
in the third quarter of  we sold our cimzia royalty interest 
on july   servier and we entered into an agreement with boehringer ingelheim to transfer xoma technology and processes for the manufacture of gevokizumab to boehringer lngelheim for boehringer ingelheim implementation and validation in preparation for the commercial manufacture of gevokizumab 
upon the successful completion of the transfer and the establishment of biological comparability  including validation of the xoma processes as implemented by boehringer ingelheim  we intend boehringer ingelheim will produce gevokizumab for xoma commercial use at its facility in biberach  germany 
servier and we retain all rights to the development and commercialization of gevokizumab 
transferring of our technology to boehringer ingelheim exposes us to numerous risks  including the possibility that boehringer ingelheim may not perform under the agreement as anticipated  and that we will need to successfully conduct a comparability trial demonstrating to the fda s satisfaction the similarity between xoma manufactured and boehringer ingelheim manufactured product 

table of contents because our collaborators  licensees  suppliers and contractors are independent third parties  they may be subject to different risks than we are and have significant discretion in  and different criteria for  determining the efforts and resources they will apply related to their agreements with us 
if these collaborators  licensees  suppliers and contractors do not successfully perform the functions for which they are responsible  we may not have the capabilities  resources or rights to do so on our own 
we do not know whether we  our collaborators or licensees will successfully develop and market any of the products that are or may become the subject of any of our collaboration or licensing arrangements 
in some cases these arrangements provide for funding solely by our collaborators or licensees  and in other cases  all of the funding for certain projects and a significant portion of the funding for other projects is to be provided by our collaborator or licensee  and we provide the balance of the funding 
even when we have a collaborative relationship  other circumstances may prevent it from resulting in successful development of marketable products 
in addition  third party arrangements such as ours also increase uncertainties in the related decision making processes and resulting progress under the arrangements  as we and our collaborators or licensees may reach different conclusions  or support different paths forward  based on the same information  particularly when large amounts of technical data are involved 
furthermore  our contracts with niaid contain numerous standard terms and conditions provided for in the applicable federal acquisition regulations and customary in many government contracts  some of which could allow the us government to exercise certain rights under the technology developed under these contracts 
uncertainty exists as to whether we will be able to comply with these terms and conditions in a timely manner  if at all 
in addition  we are uncertain as to the extent of niaid s demands and the flexibility that will be granted to us in meeting those demands 
although we continue to evaluate additional strategic alliances and potential partnerships  we do not know whether or when any such alliances or partnerships will be entered into 
products and technologies of other companies may render some or all of our products and product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete 
developments by others may render our products  product candidates  or technologies obsolete or uncompetitive 
technologies developed and utilized by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are changing continuously and substantially 
competition in antibody based technologies is intense and is expected to increase in the future as a number of established biotechnology firms and large chemical and pharmaceutical companies advance in these fields 
many of these competitors may be able to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own for many reasons  including that they may have significantly greater financial resources  larger research and development and marketing staffs  larger production facilities  entered into arrangements with  or acquired  biotechnology companies to enhance their capabilities  or extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials 
these factors may enable others to develop products and processes competitive with or superior to our own or those of our collaborators 
in addition  a significant amount of research in biotechnology is being carried out in universities and other non profit research organizations 
these entities are becoming increasingly interested in the commercial value of their work and may become more aggressive in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements 
furthermore  many companies and universities tend not to announce or disclose important discoveries or development programs until their patent position is secure or  for other reasons  later  as a result  we may not be able to track development of competitive products  particularly at the early stages 
positive or negative developments in connection with a potentially competing product may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise additional funding on acceptable terms 
for example  if another product is perceived to have a competitive advantage  or another product s failure is perceived to increase the likelihood that our product will fail  then investors may choose not to invest in us on terms we would accept or at all 
the examples below pertain to competitive events in the market that we review quarterly yet are not intended to be representative of all existing competitive events 
gevokizumab we  in collaboration with servier  are developing gevokizumab  a potent monoclonal antibody with unique allosteric modulating properties that binds strongly to interleukin beta il beta  a pro inflammatory cytokine 
in binding to il beta  gevokizumab inhibits the activation of the il receptor  thereby modulating the cellular signaling events that produce inflammation 
other companies are developing other products based on the same or similar therapeutic targets as gevokizumab  and these products may prove more effective than gevokizumab 
we are aware that 
table of contents novartis markets and is developing ilaris canakinumab  acz  a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes il beta 
since  canakinumab has been approved in over countries for the treatment of children and adults suffering from cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome caps 
novartis has filed for regulatory approval of canakinumab in the united states and europe for the treatment of acute attacks in gouty arthritis 
in august  novartis announced that the fda had issued a complete response letter requesting additional information  including clinical data to evaluate the benefit risk profile of canakinumab in refractory gouty arthritis patients 
in september  novartis announced positive results of a pivotal phase trial of canakinumab in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and it plans to seek regulatory approval for this indication in novartis also is pursuing other diseases in which il beta may play a prominent role  such as systemic secondary prevention of cardiovascular events 
eli lilly and company lilly is developing a monoclonal antibody to il beta in phase studies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
in june  lilly reported results from a phase study of ly in patients with type diabetes  showing a significant p  early reduction in c reactive protein crp  moderate reduction in hbac and anti inflammatory effects 
we do not know whether ly remains in development 
in  swedish orphan biovitrum obtained from amgen the global exclusive rights to kineret anakinra for rheumatoid arthritis as currently indicated in its label 
in november  the agreement regarding swedish orphan biovitrum s kineret license was expanded to include certain orphan indications 
kineret is an il receptor antagonist il ra that has been evaluated in multiple il mediated diseases  including indications we are considering for gevokizumab 
in addition to other on going studies  a proof of concept clinical trial in the united kingdom investigating kineret in patients with a certain type of myocardial infarction  or heart attack  has been completed 
in august  biovitrum announced the fda had granted orphan drug designation to kineret for the treatment of caps 
in february  regeneron pharmaceuticals  inc regeneron  announced it had received marketing approval from the fda for arcalyst rilonacept injection for subcutaneous use  an interleukin blocker or il trap  for the treatment of caps  including familial cold auto inflammatory syndrome and muckle wells syndrome in adults and children and older 
in september  regeneron announced rilonacept was approved in the eu for caps 
in june and february  regeneron announced positive results of two phase clinical trials of rilonacept in gout 
in november  regeneron announced the fda had accepted for review regeneron s supplemental bla for arcalyst for the prevention and treatment of gout 
a meeting of an fda advisory panel to review this supplemental bla was held in may with a recommendation against approval of the new use in gout 
in july  the fda issued a complete response letter that states the fda cannot approve the application in its current form and has requested additional clinical data  as well as additional cmc information related to a proposed new dosage form 
regeneron is reviewing the complete response letter from the fda and will determine appropriate next steps 
amgen has been developing amg  a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets inhibition of the action of il in april  amgen discussed results from a phase study in rheumatoid arthritis 
amg showed statistically significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and was well tolerated 
in january  medimmune  the worldwide biologics unit for astrazeneca plc  announced amgen granted it rights to develop amg worldwide except in japan 
in june  cytos biotechnology ag announced the initiation of an ascending dose phase a study of cyt ilbqb  a therapeutic vaccine targeting il beta  in type diabetes 
in  this study was extended to include two additional groups of patients 
the following companies have completed or are conducting or planning phase clinical trials of the following products for the treatment of intermediate  posterior or pan noninfectious uveitis abbott humira adalimumab  lux biosciences  inc luveniq voclosporin  novartis myfortic mycophenalate sodium and santen pharmaceutical co  ltd 
sirolimus rapamycin 
perindopril we currently are selling aceon  an angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitor  and developing fdc  a fixed dose combination of perindopril arginine and amlodipine besylate  a calcium channel blocker 
the ace inhibitor market is highly genericized with all options being available generically 
we are aware 
table of contents the leading product based on annual sales in the united states within the ace inhibitor category is lisinopril  formerly marketed by astra zeneca pharmaceuticals lp under the brand zestril and by merck co 
under the brand prinivil 
there are multiple options in the fdc market combining ace inhibitors with diuretics  and two options combining an ace inhibitor with a calcium channel blocker 
current options with a calcium channel blocker are benazepril amlodipine  formerly marketed by novartis pharmaceuticals as lotrel  and trandolapril verapamil  formerly marketed by abbot laboratories as tarka 
ace inhibitors are a segment of the larger renin angiotensin aldosterone system raas market 
this market is comprised of ace inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers arb 
both classes act on the raas in different ways to control blood pressure 
we are aware the most successful of the arb in terms of annual sales is valsartan  trade name diovan  which is marketed by novartis 
this compound  along with other arbs  has been developed in multiple fdc products with a diuretic  a calcium channel blocker amlodipine and as a triple combination of all three 
our perindopril franchise will compete directly with fdcs containing an ace inhibitor and secondarily with fixed dose combinations containing an arb or calcium channel blocker 
xoma ab we also are developing xoma ab  a combination  or cocktail  of antibodies designed to neutralize the most potent of botulinum toxins 
other companies are developing other products targeting botulism poisoning  and these products may prove more effective than xoma ab 
we are aware cangene corporation has a contract with the us department of health human services  expected to be worth million  to manufacture and supply an equine heptavalent botulism anti toxin  and emergent biosolutions  inc  is currently in development of a botulism immunoglobulin candidate that may compete with our anti botulinum neurotoxin monoclonal antibodies 
manufacturing risks and inefficiencies may affect adversely our ability to manufacture products for ourselves or others 
to the extent we continue to provide manufacturing services for our own benefit or to third parties  we are subject to manufacturing risks 
additionally  unanticipated fluctuations in customer requirements have led and may continue to lead to manufacturing inefficiencies  which if significant could lead to an impairment on our long lived assets or restructuring activities 
we must utilize our manufacturing operations in compliance with regulatory requirements  in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis  while maintaining acceptable product quality and manufacturing costs 
additional resources and changes in our manufacturing processes may be required for each new product  product modification or customer or to meet changing regulatory or third party requirements  and this work may not be completed successfully or efficiently 
manufacturing and quality problems may arise in the future to the extent we continue to perform these manufacturing activities for our own benefit or for third parties 
consequently  our development goals or milestones may not be achieved in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
in addition  to the extent we continue to make investments to improve our manufacturing operations  our efforts may not yield the improvements that we expect 
failure of our products to meet current good manufacturing practices standards may subject us to delays in regulatory approval and penalties for noncompliance 
our contract manufacturers are required to produce aceon and our clinical product candidates under current good manufacturing practices cgmp to meet acceptable standards for use in our clinical trials and for commercial sale  as applicable 
if such standards change  the ability of contract manufacturers to produce our product candidates and aceon on the schedule we require for our clinical trials or to meet commercial requirements may be affected 
in addition  contract manufacturers may not perform their obligations under their agreements with us or may discontinue their business before the time required by us to successfully produce clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and aceon 
we and our contract manufacturers are subject to pre approval inspections and periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cgmp and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over a third party manufacturer s compliance with these regulations and standards 
any difficulties or delays in our contractors manufacturing and supply of our product candidates and aceon or any failure of our contractors to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and standards could increase our costs  cause us to lose revenue  make us postpone or cancel clinical trials  prevent or delay regulatory approval by the fda and corresponding state and foreign authorities  prevent the import and or export of our product candidates and aceon  or cause any of our product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale and aceon to be recalled or withdrawn 

table of contents because many of the companies with which we do business also are in the biotechnology sector  the volatility of that sector can affect us indirectly as well as directly 
as a biotechnology company that collaborates with other biotechnology companies  the same factors that affect us directly also can adversely impact us indirectly by affecting the ability of our collaborators  partners and others with which we do business to meet their obligations to us and reduce our ability to realize the value of the consideration provided to us by these other companies 
for example  in connection with our licensing transactions relating to our bacterial cell expression technology  we have in the past and may in the future agree to accept equity securities of the licensee in payment of license fees 
the future value of these or any other shares we receive is subject both to market risks affecting our ability to realize the value of these shares and more generally to the business and other risks to which the issuer of these shares may be subject 
as we do more business internationally  we will be subject to additional political  economic and regulatory uncertainties 
we may not be able to operate successfully in any foreign market 
we believe that because the pharmaceutical industry is global in nature  international activities will be a significant part of our future business activities and when and if we are able to generate income  a substantial portion of that income will be derived from product sales and other activities outside the united states 
foreign regulatory agencies often establish standards different from those in the united states  and an inability to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could put us at a competitive disadvantage or make it uneconomical to proceed with a product or product candidate s development 
international operations and sales may be limited or disrupted by imposition of government controls  export license requirements  political or economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs  restrictions on repatriating profits  exchange rate fluctuations  withholding and other taxation  and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenues and operating expenses are paid in us dollars  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to our loan from servier in euros 
to the extent the us dollar declines in value against the euro  the effective cost of servicing our euro denominated debt will be higher 
changes in the exchange rate result in foreign currency gains or losses 
although we have managed some of our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into foreign exchange option contracts  there can be no assurance foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
in addition  our foreign exchange option contracts are re valued at each financial reporting period  which also may result in gains or losses from time to time 
if we and our partners are unable to protect our intellectual property  in particular our patent protection for our principal products  product candidates and processes  and prevent its use by third parties  our ability to compete in the market will be harmed  and we may not realize our profit potential 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret  and trademark laws to protect our proprietary technology and prevent others from duplicating our products or product candidates 
however  these means may afford only limited protection and may not prevent our competitors from duplicating our products  prevent our competitors from gaining access to our proprietary information and technology  or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage 

table of contents because of the length of time and the expense associated with bringing new products to the marketplace  we and our collaboration and development partners hold and are in the process of applying for a number of patents in the united states and abroad to protect our product candidates and important processes and also have obtained or have the right to obtain exclusive licenses to certain patents and applications filed by others 
however  the mere issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability 
the us federal courts or equivalent national courts or patent offices elsewhere may invalidate our patents or find them unenforceable 
in addition  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights effectively or to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if our intellectual property rights are not protected adequately  we may not be able to commercialize our technologies  products  or services  and our competitors could commercialize our technologies  which could result in a decrease in our sales and market share that would harm our business and operating results 
specifically  the patent position of biotechnology companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
the legal standards governing the validity of biotechnology patents are in transition  and current defenses as to issued biotechnology patents may not be adequate in the future 
accordingly  there is uncertainty as to whether any pending or future patent applications held by us will result in an issued patent  or that if patents are issued to us  that such patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitive technologies  whether competitors will be able to design around our patents or develop and obtain patent protection for technologies  designs or methods that are more effective than those covered by our patents and patent applications  or the extent to which our product candidates could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may lead to costly litigation  result in the payment of substantial damages or royalties  and or prevent us from using technology that is essential to our business 
we have established a portfolio of patents  both united states and foreign  related to our bacterial cell expression technology  including claims to novel promoter sequences  secretion signal sequences  compositions and methods for expression and secretion of recombinant proteins from bacteria  including immunoglobulin gene products 
most of the more important european patents in our bacterial cell expression patent portfolio expired in july or earlier 
if certain patents issued to others are upheld or if certain patent applications filed by others issue and are upheld  we may require licenses from others to develop and commercialize certain potential products incorporating our technology or we may become involved in litigation to determine the proprietary rights of others 
these licenses  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  and any such litigation may be costly and may have other adverse effects on our business  such as inhibiting our ability to compete in the marketplace and absorbing significant management time 
due to the uncertainties regarding biotechnology patents  we also have relied and will continue to rely upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position 
all of our employees have signed confidentiality agreements under which they have agreed not to use or disclose any of our proprietary information 
research and development contracts and relationships between us and our scientific consultants and potential customers provide access to aspects of our know how that are protected generally under confidentiality agreements 
these confidentiality agreements may be breached or may not be enforced by a court 
to the extent proprietary information is divulged to competitors or to the public generally  such disclosure may affect our ability to develop or commercialize our products adversely by giving others a competitive advantage or by undermining our patent position 
litigation regarding intellectual property can be costly and expose us to risks of counterclaims against us 
we may be required to engage in litigation or other proceedings to protect our intellectual property 
the cost to us of this litigation  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
such litigation also could divert management s attention and resources 
in addition  if this litigation is resolved against us  our patents may be declared invalid  and we could be held liable for significant damages 
in addition  we may be subject to a claim that we are infringing another party s patent 
if such claim is resolved against us  we or our collaborators may be enjoined from developing  manufacturing  selling or importing products  processes or services unless we obtain a license from the other party 
such license may not be available on reasonable terms  thus preventing us from using these products  processes or services and adversely affecting our revenue 
we may be unable to price our products effectively or obtain adequate reimbursement for sales of our products  which would prevent our products from becoming profitable 
if we or our third party collaborators or licensees succeed in bringing our product candidates to the market  they may not be considered cost effective  and reimbursement to the patient may not be available or may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis 
in both the united states and elsewhere  sales of medical products and treatments are dependent  in part  on the availability of reimbursement to the patient from third party payors  such as government and private insurance plans 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services 
our business is affected by the efforts of government and third party payors to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means 
in the united states  there have been and will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement government controls on pricing 

table of contents in addition  the emphasis on managed care in the united states has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on the pricing of pharmaceutical products 
we cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or the effect these proposals or managed care efforts may have on our business 
healthcare reform measures and other statutory or regulatory changes could adversely affect our business 
in both the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our business 
in march  the us congress enacted and president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively  ppaca  which includes a number of healthcare reform provisions 
the reforms imposed by the law are expected to impact the pharmaceutical industry significantly  most likely in the area of pharmaceutical product pricing 
while the law may increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our products or product candidates  its cost containment measures also could adversely affect reimbursement for our existing or potential products  however  the full effects of this law cannot be known until these provisions are implemented and the relevant federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to extensive regulation  and from time to time legislative bodies and governmental agencies consider changes to such regulations that could have significant impact on industry participants 
for example  in light of certain highly publicized safety issues regarding certain drugs that had received marketing approval  the us congress has considered various proposals regarding drug safety  including some that would require additional safety studies and monitoring and could make drug development more costly 
we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation  if any  relating to safety or other aspects of drug development may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business 
beginning in  the ppaca also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on pharmaceutical manufacturers for payments to healthcare providers and ownership of their stock by healthcare providers 
failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of  per year or up to an aggregate of million per year for knowing failures  for all payments  transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission 
on december   cms released its proposed rule implementing these provisions  providing further clarification to ambiguous or unclear statutory language and providing instructions for manufacturers to comply with such requirements 
cms has not issued a final rule to date 
the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies also are affected by the efforts of governments  third party payors and others to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare to consumers 
in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the healthcare system  such as proposals relating to the reimportation of drugs into the united states from other countries where they are then sold at a lower price and government control of prescription drug pricing 
we expect current health care reform measures  such as ppaca  and those that may be adopted in the future could result in a decrease in the share price of our common stock  limit our ability to raise capital or to obtain strategic collaborations or licenses or successfully commercialize our products 
we are exposed to an increased risk of product liability claims  and a series of related cases is currently pending against us 
the testing  marketing and sales of medical products entails an inherent risk of allegations of product liability 
we have been party to a number of product liability claims filed against genentech inc  and even though genentech has agreed to indemnify us in connection with these matters  there can be no assurance these or other products liability lawsuits will not result in liability to us or that our insurance or contractual arrangements will provide us with adequate protection against such liabilities 
in the event of one or more large  unforeseen awards of damages against us  our product liability insurance may not provide adequate coverage 
a significant product liability claim for which we were not covered by insurance or indemnified by a third party would have to be paid from cash or other assets  which could have an adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock 
to the extent we have sufficient insurance coverage  such a claim would result in higher subsequent insurance rates 
in addition  product liability claims can have various other ramifications  including loss of future sales opportunities  increased costs associated with replacing products  a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation  and divert our management s attention from our business  each of which could also adversely affect our business and operating results 
the loss of key personnel  including our chief executive officer  could delay or prevent achieving our objectives 
our research  product development and business efforts could be affected adversely by the loss of one or more key members of our scientific or management staff  particularly our executive officers john varian  our chief executive officer  patrick j 
scannon  md  phd  our executive vice president and chief scientific officer  fred kurland  our vice president  finance  chief financial officer and secretary  and paul d 
rubin  md  our senior vice president  research and development and chief medical officer 
we currently do not have key person insurance on any of our employees 

table of contents our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and other tax attributes will be substantially limited by section of the us internal revenue code 
section of the us internal revenue code of  as amended  generally limits the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carry forwards nols and certain other tax attributes against any taxable income in taxable periods after the ownership change 
the amount of taxable income in each taxable year after the ownership change that may be offset by pre change nols and certain other pre change tax attributes is generally equal to the product of a the fair market value of the corporation s outstanding shares or  in the case of a foreign corporation  the fair market value of items treated as connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states immediately prior to the ownership change and b the long term tax exempt rate ie  a rate of interest established by the ie internal revenue service irs that fluctuates from month to month 
in general  an ownership change occurs whenever the percentage of the shares of a corporation owned  directly or indirectly  by percent shareholders within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code increases by more than percentage points over the lowest percentage of the shares of such corporation owned  directly or indirectly  by such percent shareholders at any time over the preceding three years 
based on an analysis under section of the internal revenue code which subjects the amount of pre change nols and certain other pre change tax attributes that can be utilized to an annual limitation  the company experienced ownership changes in and which substantially limit the future use of our pre change nols and certain other pre change tax attributes per year 
as of december   the company has excluded the nols and r d credits that will expire as a result of the annual limitations see note income taxes in the notes to the financial statements 
to the extent that the company does not utilize its carry forwards within the applicable statutory carry forward periods  either because of section limitations or the lack of sufficient taxable income  the carry forwards will also expire unused 
we may not realize the expected benefits of our initiatives to reduce costs across our operations  and we may incur significant charges or write downs as part of these efforts 
we have pursued and may continue to pursue a number of initiatives to reduce costs of our operations 
in january  we implemented a workforce reduction of approximately to improve our cost structure 
this workforce reduction resulted primarily from our decisions to utilize a contract manufacturing organization for phase and commercial antibody production and to eliminate internal research functions that are non differentiating or that can be obtained cost effectively by contract service providers 
during the year ended december   as a result of our streamlining of operations  we incurred restructuring and related severance costs totaling approximately million  of which million were cash charges 
we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our current and future initiatives to reduce costs 
in addition to restructuring or other charges  we may experience disruptions in our operations as a result of these initiatives 
because we are a relatively small biopharmaceutical company with limited resources  we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our success in developing marketable products and achieving a competitive position will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and management personnel  particularly in areas requiring specific technical  scientific or medical expertise 
we had approximately employees as of march  we may require additional experienced executive  accounting  research and development  legal  administrative and other personnel from time to time in the future 
there is intense competition for the services of these personnel  especially in california 
moreover  we expect that the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located  may impair our ability to attract and retain employees in the future 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel and retaining and motivating existing personnel  our operations may suffer and we may be unable to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively 
global credit and financial market conditions may reduce our ability to access and maintain capital for our operations 
traditionally  we have funded a large portion of our research and development expenditures through raising capital in the equity markets 
recent events  including failures and bankruptcies among large commercial and investment banks  have led to considerable declines and uncertainties in these and other capital markets and have led to new regulatory and other restrictions that may have broad effect on the nature of these markets 
these circumstances could severely restrict the ability to raise new capital by companies such as us in the future 

table of contents volatility in the financial markets also has created liquidity problems in investments previously thought to bear a minimal risk 
for example  money market fund investors  including us  have in the past been unable to retrieve the full amount of funds  even in highly rated liquid money market accounts  upon maturity 
although as of december   we have received the full amount of proceeds from money market fund investments  an inability to retrieve funds from money market fund investments as they mature in the future could have a material and adverse impact on our business  results of operations and cash flows 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
while we are not aware of any downgrades  material losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents since december   no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents negatively or our ability to meet our financing objectives 
our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures 
despite the implementation of security measures  our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future collaborators  licensees  suppliers  contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from cyber attacks  computer viruses  unauthorized access  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication and electrical failures 
we could experience failures in our information systems and computer servers  which could be the result of a cyber attack and could result in an interruption of our normal business operations and require substantial expenditure of financial and administrative resources to remedy 
system failures  accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our operations and can result in a material disruption of our development programs  commercialization activities and other business operations 
the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data 
similarly  we rely on third parties to supply components for and manufacture our product and product candidates  conduct clinical trials of our product candidates and warehouse and distribute aceon  and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business 
to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of  or damage to  our data or applications  or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information  we could incur liability and the development of gevokizumab  fdc or any of our other product candidates and the commercialization of aceon could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected 
calamities  power shortages or power interruptions at our berkeley headquarters and manufacturing facility could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operations 
our principal operations are located in northern california  including our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility in berkeley  california 
this location is in an area of seismic activity near active earthquake faults 
any earthquake  terrorist attack  fire  power shortage or other calamity affecting our facilities may disrupt our business and could have material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have a significant stockholder  which may limit other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and may give rise to conflicts of interest 
entities controlled by felix j 
baker and julian c 
baker beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march   which includes warrants to purchase approximately million shares of xoma s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on july   our board of directors elected kelvin neu  md  to serve on our board of directors 
dr 
neu is a managing director at baker bros 
advisors  llc  an entity controlled by felix j 
baker and julian c 
baker 
accordingly  these entities may exert significant influence over us and any action requiring the approval of the holders of our stock  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
furthermore  conflicts of interest could arise in the future between us  on the one hand  and these entities  on the other hand  concerning potential competitive business activities  business opportunities  the issuance of additional securities and other matters 
our organizational documents contain provisions that may prevent transactions that could be beneficial to our stockholders and may insulate our management from removal 
our charter and by laws require certain procedures to be followed and time periods to be met for any stockholder to propose matters to be considered at annual meetings of stockholders  including nominating directors for election at those meetings  and authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights  preferences and other designations  including voting rights  of those shares as the board of directors may determine 

table of contents in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl  that may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding common stock  from merging or combining with us 
these provisions of our organizational documents and the dgcl  alone or in combination with each other  may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of common stock  could limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests  and could make it considerably more difficult for a potential acquirer to replace management
