critical accounting estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are deemed to be necessary 
significant estimates made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include  but are not limited to  the following revenue recognition we generate our revenue primarily from subscription services and media 
subscription services include subscriptions  licenses and fees for access to securities investment information  stock market commentary  rate services and transactional information pertaining to the mergers and acquisitions environment 
subscriptions are generally charged to customers credit cards or are directly billed to corporate subscribers 
these are generally billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis 
we calculate net subscription revenue by deducting from gross revenue an estimate of potential refunds from cancelled subscriptions as well as chargebacks of disputed credit card charges 
net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription periods 
deferred revenue relates to subscription fees for which amounts have been collected but for which revenue has not been recognized because services have not yet been provided 
subscription revenue is subject to estimation and variability due to the fact that  in the normal course of business  subscribers may for various reasons contact us or their credit card companies to request a refund or other adjustment for a previously purchased subscription 
with respect to most of our annual subscription products  we offer the ability to receive a refund during the first days but none thereafter 
accordingly  we maintain a provision for estimated future revenue reductions resulting from expected refunds and chargebacks related to subscriptions for which revenue was recognized in a prior period 
the calculation of this provision is based upon historical trends and is reevaluated each quarter 
the provision was not material for any of the three years ended december  media revenue includes advertising revenue  which is derived from the sale of internet sponsorship arrangements and from the delivery of banner  tile  contextual  performance based and interactive advertisement and sponsorship placements in our advertising supported web sites  and is recognized as the advertising is displayed  provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
capitalized software and web site development costs we expense all costs incurred in the preliminary project stage for software developed for internal use and capitalize all external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
in addition  for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to internal use computer software projects  to the extent of the time spent directly on the project  we capitalize payroll and payroll related costs of such employees incurred once the development has reached the applications development stage 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized software development costs totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
all costs incurred for upgrades  maintenance and enhancements that do not result in additional functionality are expensed 
we also account for our web site development costs under asc  which provides guidance on the accounting for the costs of development of company web sites  dividing the web site development costs into five stages the planning stage  during which the business and or project plan is formulated and functionalities  necessary hardware and technology are determined  the web site application and infrastructure development stage  which involves acquiring or developing hardware and software to operate the web site  the graphics development stage  during which the initial graphics and layout of each page are designed and coded  the content development stage  during which the information to be presented on the web site  which may be either textual or graphical in nature  is developed  and the operating stage  during which training  administration  maintenance and other costs to operate the existing web site are incurred 
the costs incurred in the web site application and infrastructure stage  the graphics development stage and the content development stage are capitalized  all other costs are expensed as incurred 
amortization of capitalized costs will not commence until the project is completed and placed into service 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized web site development costs totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
capitalized software and web site development costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software or web site 
during the year ended december   completed capitalized software and web site development projects were deemed to primarily have a two to three year useful life 
total amortization expense was approximately million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related acquisition costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
under the provisions of asc  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever indications of impairment exist 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets exceed their implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge for this excess 
we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment using a two step impairment test approach at the company level  as the company is considered to operate as a single reporting unit 
the first step compares the fair value of the company with its book value  including goodwill 
as outlined in asc  if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
as the company s concluded that the company s goodwill was not impaired as of the valuation date  step two was not performed 
the company performs annual impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of september each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 
in conducting our annual impairment test  the company  through its independent appraisal firm  used the market approach for the valuation of our common stock and the income approach for our preferred shares 
based on these approaches  we determined the company s business enterprise value common equity plus preferred equity to be million as of the valuation date 
we calculated the common equity value using the midpoint of the company s high and low common stock prices on the valuation date  as shown in the following figure average stock price low stock price high stock price average stock price we multiplied the average stock price of by the  common shares outstanding  indicating a common equity value of million on a non controlling basis 
in order to determine the value of the common equity on a controlling basis  a control premium was applied 
we searched the factset mergerstat bvr control premium study for all transactions involving us companies during the past months  and for transactions involving us companies with the same sic code as the company over various time periods 
the data indicated a wide range of control premiums ranging from to for deals that have taken place in the last three years  and we conservatively selected percent as an appropriate control premium 
applying a control premium of percent resulted in a value of the common equity on a controlling basis of million 
in addition to common stock  the company has preferred stock with a liquidation value of million 
with the assistance of our third party valuation firm  we used the income approach to compute the fair value of the preferred stock to be million and thus we added the million value of the company s preferred stock to the fair value of the common stock 
the resulting enterprise value of million represents the value of the company on a controlling basis 
this value was greater than the carrying value of million  indicating the company s goodwill was not impaired as of the september  valuation date 
the fair value of the company s outstanding preferred shares requires significant judgments  including the estimation of the amount of time until a liquidation event occurs as well as an appropriate cash flow discount rate 
further  in assigning a fair value to the company s preferred stock  the company also considered that the preferred shareholders are entitled to receive a million liquidation preference upon liquidation or dissolution of the company or upon any change of control event as defined in the certificate of designation of series b preferred stock 
additionally  the holders of the preferred shares are entitled to receive dividends and to vote as a single class together with the holders of the common stock on an as converted basis and provided certain preferred share ownership levels are maintained  are entitled to representation on the company s board of directors and may unilaterally block issuance of certain classes of capital stock  the purchase or redemption of certain classes of capital stock  including common stock with certain exceptions and any increases in the per share amount of dividends payable to the holders of the common stock 
the company also performed  with the assistance of its appraisal firm  an income approach by using the discounted cash flow dcf method to confirm the reasonableness of the above calculated enterprise value 
under the dcf method  the calculated enterprise value also indicated that the company s goodwill was not impaired 
determining the fair value of goodwill or an indefinite lived intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and appropriate market comparables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable 
however  as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  actual future results may differ from these estimates 
as of december   the company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill due to certain potential impairment indicators  including the loss of certain key personnel 
the fair value of the company s goodwill was estimated using a market approach  based upon actual prices of the company s common stock excluding any control premium  and the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding preferred shares 
as a result of this december  impairment test  the company concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
a decrease in the price of the company s common stock  or changes in the estimated value of the company s preferred shares  could materially affect the determination of the fair value and could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
additionally  the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of intangible assets each year to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support their useful life 
there have been no changes in useful lives of intangible assets for each period presented 
long lived assets the company evaluates long lived assets  including amortizable identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
upon such an occurrence  recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to forecasted undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during  the company undertook certain significant actions to lower its overall cost structure and improve its cash flow in future periods 
these actions include the hiring of a new management team  including a new ceo  cto  editor in chief and general counsel 
under this new management team  the company has effected significant restructuring actions during designed to realign the overall cost structure of the company 
by implementing these restructuring actions  the company has reduced full time headcount excluding acquisition related headcount by from december  levels 
part of this headcount reduction resulted in a deliberate shift of our editorial content creation from a full time employee model to an outsourced contributor model that will better align costs with revenue in the future 
the company also took actions to lower vendor related costs  in particular we discontinued certain software as a service saas  and consulting and data provider contracts 
these actions were taken with the full understanding that they would have significant short term costs such as severance costs and other write offs  but were taken with the long term view of positioning the company to return to growth and profitability in future periods 
in addition to reducing overhead costs and creating a more stream lined editorial process  the company also considered areas where it could expand its business thru the offering of complementary services and products 
as part of this growth strategy  in september  the company acquired the deal as disclosed in the form q for the quarter ended september  the company believes that this acquisition will support the company s initiatives to expand our revenue product offerings into the institutional subscription space and upon the closing of this transaction we took immediate steps that we believe will lead to such acquisition being accretive to our results 
these actions included the closing of the unprofitable print business and eliminating the related cost structure  as well as eliminating the majority of their overhead costs by leveraging the company s current infrastructure 
as a result of these restructuring actions and our acquisition of the deal  the company believes that its long term business model and intangible assets will result in increased revenues and positive operating cash flows in future periods 
in looking to future periods  the company s current internal forecasts are favorable and reflect the full year impact of the actions described above 
the company s internal forecasts for indicate a return to generating positive operating cash flows 
this increase in our forecasted year over year operating cash flow is the result of the full year impact of our cost cutting measures  the deal acquisition  as well as cost savings related to certain definitive actions that were recently implemented  in particular our move from a hosted it infrastructure to the cloud 
we believe that given our new cost structure and additional revenue stream from the deal that positive operating cash flows will continue in future periods 
notwithstanding our conclusion that we did not have a triggering event as described above  based upon the company s cash flow projections  there would have been no impairment to long lived assets at december investments we believe that conservative investment policies are appropriate and we are not motivated to strive for aggressive spreads above treasury rates 
preservation of capital is of foremost concern  and by restricting investments to investment grade securities of relatively short maturities  we believe that our capital will be largely protected from severe economic conditions or drastic shifts in interest rates 
a high degree of diversification adds further controls over capital risk 
financial instruments that subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
we maintain all of our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash in five domestic financial institutions and we perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions 
as of december   the company s cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash primarily consisted of money market funds and checking accounts 
marketable securities consist of liquid short term us treasuries  government agencies  certificates of deposit insured up to fdic limits  investment grade corporate and municipal bonds  corporate floating rate notes and two municipal auction rate securities ars issued by the district of columbia with a par value of approximately million 
the ars pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  typically every days  and mature in the year as of december   the total fair value of these marketable securities was approximately million and the total cost basis was approximately million 
with the exception of the ars  the maximum maturity for any investment is three years 
the company accounts for its marketable securities in accordance with the provisions of asc the company classifies these securities as available for sale and the securities are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and excluded from net loss 
during  the company made an investment in debtfolio  inc  doing business as geezeo  an online financial management solutions provider for banks and credit unions 
the investment totaled approximately million for an ownership stake 
additionally  the company incurred approximately million of legal fees in connection with this investment 
during the first quarter of  the carrying value of the company s investment was written down to fair value based upon an estimate of the market value of the company s equity in light of debtfolio s efforts to raise capital at the time from third parties 
the impairment charge approximated million 
the company performed an additional impairment test as of december  and no additional impairment in value was noted 
during the three months ended june   the company determined it necessary to record a second impairment charge  writing the value of the investment to zero 
this was deemed necessary by management based upon their consideration of debtfolio  inc s continued negative cash flow from operations  current financial position and lack of current liquidity 
in october  debtfolio  inc repurchased the company s ownership stake in exchange for a subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million payable on october  as of december   we maintain a full valuation allowance against our subordinated promissory note due to the uncertainty of eventual collection 
see note to consolidated financial statements fair value measurements for additional information about the investment of the company s cash 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under asc  share based payment transactions asc 
this requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based upon estimated fair values 
stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   there was approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense remaining to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the value of stock options granted to employees and directors is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the value of each restricted stock unit under the company s performance incentive plan the plan is equal to the closing price per share of our common stock on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and includes compensation expense for all share based payment awards based upon the estimated grant date fair value 
we recognize compensation expense for share based payment awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the years ended december   and is based upon awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant which are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this determination is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
the amount of equity based compensation expense recorded each period is net of estimated forfeitures 
the weighted average grant date fair value per share of employee stock options granted during the years ended december   and was  and  respectively  using the black scholes model with the weighted average assumptions presented below 
because option pricing models require the use of subjective assumptions  changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the options 
the assumptions presented in the table below represent the weighted average value of the applicable assumption used to value stock options at their grant date 
in determining the volatility assumption  we used a historical analysis of the volatility of our share price for the preceding period equal to the expected option lives 
the expected option lives  which represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  were estimated based upon the simplified method for plain vanilla options 
the risk free interest rate assumption was based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption was based on the history and expectation of future dividend payouts 
the company s estimate of pre vesting forfeitures is primarily based on the company s historical experience and is adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures as the options vest 
for the year ended december  expected option lives years years years expected volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends the impact of stock based compensation expense has been significant to reported results of operations and per share amounts 
because option pricing models require the use of subjective assumptions  changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of the options 
for each increase in the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model  the resulting estimated impact to our total operating expense for the year ended december  would have caused an increase of approximately  for each increase in the expected volatility used in the black scholes option pricing model  the resulting estimated impact to our total operating expense for the year ended december  would have caused an increase of approximately  because options are expensed over three to five years from the date of grant  the foregoing estimated increases include potential expense for options granted during the prior years 
in calculating the amount of each variable that is included in the black scholes options pricing model ie  option exercise price  stock price  option term  risk free interest rate  annual dividend rate  and volatility  the weighted average of such variable for all grants issued in a given year was used 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we account for our income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december  and  we maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our prior history of pre tax losses and uncertainty about the timing of and ability to generate taxable income in the future and our assessment that the realization of the deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criterion under asc asc also prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as unrecognized benefits 
a liability is recognized for an unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not recognized as a result of applying the provisions of asc as of december  and  no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be recorded 
deferred tax assets pertaining to windfall tax benefits on exercise of share awards and the corresponding credit to additional paid in capital are recorded if the related tax deduction reduces tax payable 
the company has elected the with and without approach regarding ordering of windfall tax benefits to determine whether the windfall tax benefit did reduce taxes payable in the current year 
under this approach  the windfall tax benefits would be recognized in additional paid in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after considering all other tax benefits presently available to us 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the commitments and contingencies section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimate of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where deemed appropriate 
the company would record a material loss contingency in its consolidated financial statements if the loss is both probable of occurring and reasonably estimated 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may  in the future  adjust its associated liabilities

revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
subscription services revenue for the year ended december  decreased by when compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in the weighted average number of subscriptions during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   partially offset by a increase in the average revenue recognized per subscription during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   combined with approximately million of revenue related to the operations of the deal since its acquisition in september the decrease in the weighted average number of subscriptions was primarily impacted by the trailing twelve month trends of churn of our existing subscriber base and our ability to acquire new subscribers 
while our average monthly churn rates for the trailing twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in the prior year  has remained relatively stable  we were unable to acquire a sufficient number of new subscribers in to offset the losses due to churn 
the increase in the average revenue recognized per subscription during the period is primarily the result of the mix of products sold and higher product pricing 
media

the decrease was primarily the result of reduced compensation expense due to a decrease in average headcount excluding the impact of acquired headcount of the deal  combined with lower costs related to computer services and supplies and data used on the company s web sites  the aggregate of which decreased by approximately million 
these cost decreases were partially offset by costs associated with the operations of the deal since its acquisition  increased costs related to revenue share payments made to certain distribution partners  as well as the use of nonemployee content providers as the company has shifted its strategy more towards a contributor freelance model with fewer full time editorial staff  the aggregate of which increased by approximately million 
although the dollar amount of cost of services expense decreased over the periods  cost of services expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in the year ended december   from in the prior year period  as our cost cutting initiatives did not completely keep pace with the decline in revenue

com subsidiary  occupancy  training and insurance costs  the aggregate sum of which decreased by approximately million 
these cost decreases were partially offset by costs related to the company s acquisition and subsequent operation of the deal since its acquisition combined with increased recruiting fees  the aggregate of which increased by approximately million 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue approximated in the year ended december   the same as in the prior year period  as our cost cutting initiatives were in line with the decline in revenue 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by approximately million  or  over the periods 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue approximated in the year ended december   as compared to in the prior year period 
restructuring and other charges 
during the year ended december   the company implemented a targeted reduction in force 
additionally  in accessing the ongoing needs of the organization  the company elected to discontinue using certain software as a service  consulting and data providers  and elected to write off certain previously capitalized software development projects 
the actions were taken after a review of the company s cost structure with the goal of better aligning the cost structure with the company s revenue base 
these restructuring efforts resulted in restructuring and other charges from continuing operations of approximately million during the year ended december  additionally  as a result of the company s acquisition of the deal  the company discontinued the use of the deal s office space and implemented a reduction in force to eliminate redundant positions  resulting in restructuring and other charges from continuing operations of approximately million during the year ended december  these activities were offset by a reduction to previously estimated restructuring and other charges resulting in a net credit of approximately million 
gain on disposition of assets 
during the year ended december   the company sold certain non strategic assets resulting in a gain of approximately million 
net interest income for the year ended december  percent change net interest income   the decrease in net interest income was primarily the result of lower interest rates on bank deposits combined with reduced cash balances

net loss for the year ended december  also included a net loss of approximately million related to the operations of the deal since its acquisition 
excluding noncash charges related to depreciation  and amortization of acquired intangible assets  net loss for the deal would have approximated million
