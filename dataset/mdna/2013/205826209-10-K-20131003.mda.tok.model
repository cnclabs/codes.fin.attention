item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage assumptions 
because our consolidated gross profit  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  depends on sales  sales mix and related gross profit for each individual segment  it is difficult to estimate 
nevertheless  based on orders currently in our consolidated backlog and orders we expect to receive  we anticipate that our consolidated gross profit in fiscal  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  will be comparable to the level we achieved in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal reflect a net benefit of million  consisting of a million benefit relating to a change in the fair value of a contingent earn out liability associated with our acquisition of stampede technologies  inc stampede  offset  in part  by million of net pre tax restructuring costs associated with the wind down of our microsatellite product line 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal reflect a net expense of million  consisting of i million of net restructuring costs associated with the wind down of our microsatellite product line  ii million of professional fees associated with a withdrawn contested proxy solicitation related to our fiscal annual meeting of stockholders  offset  in part  by iii a million benefit relating to a change in the fair value of a contingent earn out liability associated with our acquisition of stampede 
excluding the million net benefit and million net charge for fiscal and  respectively  as discussed above  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal and would have been million and million  respectively  or and of consolidated net sales  respectively 
this decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses in dollars  and increase as a percentage of consolidated net sales  was primarily due to overall lower spending associated with the significantly lower level of consolidated net sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal also include the benefit of cost reduction actions that we have taken in all three of our reportable operating segments 
amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal 
index in light of modest expected consolidated net sales growth in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses  in dollars  are only expected to be slightly higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of consolidated net sales  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal to be comparable to fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
for fiscal and  research and development expenses of million and million  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment  million and million  respectively  related to our rf microwave amplifiers segment  million and million  respectively  related to our mobile data communications segment 
the remaining research and development expenses we incurred relate to the amortization of stock based compensation expense  which is not allocated to our three operating segments 
amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as research and development expenses was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales  research and development expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  is attributable to the significantly lower level of consolidated net sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect research and development expenses  in dollars  for fiscal  to be comparable to the amount we invested during fiscal and  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  to be slightly lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which is not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but is included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization relating to intangible assets with finite lives was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the slight decrease is attributable to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized in fiscal excluding the impact of any acquisitions that we may make in fiscal  amortization of intangibles with finite lives for fiscal is expected to be similar to fiscal operating income 
operating income for fiscal and was million  or of consolidated net sales  and million  or of consolidated net sales  respectively 
operating income for fiscal and reflects a net benefit of million and a net expense of million  respectively as discussed above in the selling  general and administrative expenses section 
operating income in fiscal also includes a net benefit of million  as discussed in the above gross profit section 
excluding these amounts  operating income for fiscal and would have been million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of consolidated net sales 
this decline in operating income both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales is primarily attributable to the significantly lower level of consolidated net sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal and the previously discussed changes in our sales mix 
operating income  by segment  is discussed further below 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment was million or of related net sales for fiscal as compared to million or of related net sales for fiscal excluding the previously discussed change in fair value of the stampede contingent earn out liability in both fiscal periods  operating income  as a percentage of related net sales  would have been and  respectively 
the decrease from to was primarily due to lower net sales activity and lower gross profit  as a percentage of related net sales  as discussed above 
despite the fact that our gross profit  as a percentage of related net sales  in this segment will be unfavorably impacted by the cost plus incentive fee development and engineering services work that we are currently performing related to the us navy atip and the fact that we are in the early stages of our million contract for our north african government end customer  we expect that operating income  as percentage of related segment net sales  will improve in fiscal as compared to the as discussed above in fiscal 
index our rf microwave amplifiers segment generated operating income of million or of related net sales for fiscal as compared to million or of related net sales for fiscal this decrease in operating income  both in dollars and as a percentage of related net sales  is primarily due to lower net sales and a lower gross profit  as a percentage of related net sales  as discussed above 
based on the nature and type of orders that are currently in our backlog  anticipated orders we expect to receive  and anticipated research and development spending  we expect operating income  both in dollars and as a percentage of related net sales in this segment in fiscal to be higher as compared to fiscal our mobile data communications segment generated operating income of million or of related net sales for fiscal as compared to million or of related net sales for fiscal the decrease in operating income  in dollars  and increase in operating income  as a percentage of related net sales  was primarily driven by overall changes in this segment sales mix  as discussed above 
operating income in this segment for fiscal was largely driven by the bft sustainment services we performed primarily the annual million intellectual property license fee revenue offset  in part  by a million net pre tax restructuring charge associated with the wind down of our microsatellite product line  as further discussed above 
operating income in this segment  in fiscal  reflects a benefit of million related to the finalization of pricing for certain mts and bft orders offset  in part  by million of net pre tax restructuring charges related to our microsatellite product line 
although net sales in our mobile data communications segment are expected to be significantly lower in fiscal  operating income in this segment in dollars is expected to be comparable to the level we achieved in fiscal based on the nature and type of orders that are currently in our backlog and the anticipated orders we expect to receive  operating income in this segment  as a percentage of related net sales in fiscal is expected to be higher than the achieved in fiscal unallocated operating expenses were million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal excluding the aforementioned million of costs related to a withdrawn proxy solicitation recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses  unallocated operating expenses were million for fiscal the decrease from million to million is primarily attributable to a decline in spending associated with the lower level of consolidated net sales  as discussed above  and as result of various cost reduction actions 
amortization of stock based compensation expense  which is included in unallocated operating expenses  was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal based on the amount of outstanding equity awards  stock based compensation expense in fiscal is expected to be higher than fiscal because overall global business conditions remain challenging  it remains difficult to predict our consolidated sales mix  making it difficult to precisely estimate future operating margins as a percentage of consolidated net sales 
nevertheless  we expect operating income  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  in fiscal to improve from the we achieved in fiscal after excluding the million net benefit discussed in the selling  general and administrative expenses section above and we are targeting gaap operating income  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  to be at least in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and primarily reflects interest on our convertible notes 
we expect that our convertible notes will be converted or paid off at the first put date in may as such  we currently anticipate that interest expense in fiscal will be lower than fiscal interest income and other 
interest income and other for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the decrease of million is primarily attributable to lower cash balances as a result of repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments 
interest income and other for both periods is primarily generated from interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
all of our available cash and cash equivalents are currently invested in bank deposits  money market mutual funds  certificates of deposit  and short term us treasury securities which  at this time  are currently yielding a blended annual interest rate of approximately 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal reflects a net discrete tax benefit of approximately million  primarily related to the finalization of certain tax deductions in connection with the filing of our fiscal federal income tax return and the retroactive extension of the federal research and experimentation credit from december  to december   offset  in part  by the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets of one of our foreign subsidiaries 
our effective tax rate for fiscal reflects net discrete tax benefits of approximately million  primarily resulting from the effective settlement of certain federal and state income tax audits  as well as the reversal of tax contingencies no longer required due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation 

index excluding discrete tax items in both periods  our effective tax rate for fiscal would have been as compared to for fiscal the increase from to is principally attributable to the product and geographical mix changes in our consolidated results of operations for fiscal our income tax expense for fiscal also benefited from the recording of twelve months of federal and experimentation credits as compared to five months in fiscal  as the federal research and experimentation credit had previously expired on december  based on our expected business outlook  and excluding the impact of any potential discrete tax items  our fiscal estimated effective tax rate is expected to approximate which represents an increase from the in fiscal our full year us gaap effective income tax rate in fiscal will depend on various factors including  but not limited to  future enacted tax legislation  the actual geographic composition of our revenue and pre tax income  the effective settlement of income tax audits  future acquisitions  and any future non deductible expenses 
our federal income tax returns for fiscal through are subject to potential future irs audit 
future tax assessments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
as further discussed below  the significant period over period decrease reflects lower net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment  and more notably in our mobile data communications segment  partially offset by higher sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
telecommunications transmission net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease reflects significantly lower sales in our over the horizon microwave systems product line and  to a lesser extent  lower sales in our satellite earth station product line 
sales of our satellite earth station products were lower during fiscal as compared to fiscal although sales related to international customers were higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal  sales related to the us government were lower due to ongoing us government budget pressures 
sales of our over the horizon microwave systems significantly decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of lower sales related to a nearly completed million contract whose end user is a north african government  and a completed million contract whose end user is a middle eastern government 
these decreases were offset  in part  by shipments related to orders for our mtts for end use by the us army 
in fiscal  we began recording revenue related to a million contract including million of additional orders received in fiscal we received in june from a domestic prime contractor to design and furnish a telecommunications system for the same north african government end customer 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal rf microwave amplifiers net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment were million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase primarily reflects higher sales of our traveling wave tube amplifiers 
bookings in our rf microwave amplifiers segment for fiscal were significantly higher as compared to fiscal our rf microwave amplifiers segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal mobile data communications net sales in our mobile data communications segment were million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal  a substantial decrease of million  or 
this decrease is attributable to a substantial decline in combined sales to the us army almost all of which was used to support the bft program  including the mts program and  to a lesser extent  lower sales related to the design and manufacture of microsatellites 
sales to the us army for both the mts and bft programs during fiscal were million  or of our mobile data communications segment sales  as compared to million  or  during fiscal 
index sales related to the design and manufacture of microsatellites for fiscal were million  a significant decrease from the million we achieved in fiscal this decline is almost entirely attributable to lower revenues related to our large contract to deliver a spacecraft bus to the us navy naval research laboratory 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted a plan to wind down our microsatellite product line and recorded a million restructuring charge 
our mobile data communications segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal geography and customer type sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors of the us government represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
international sales which include sales to us companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
excluding total net sales in our mobile data communications segment which derives a substantial majority of its net sales from the us government  sales to the us government represented of consolidated net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million which was primarily driven by the significant decline in consolidated net sales 
despite the decline in gross profit dollars during fiscal  our gross profit  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  increased from for fiscal to for fiscal during fiscal  our gross profit reflects a net benefit of million as a result of a benefit of approximately million related to the finalization of pricing for certain previously received mts and bft orders  partially offset by a charge of million in cost of sales related to our plan to wind down our microsatellite product line 
excluding this net benefit  gross profit  as a percentage of consolidated net sales for fiscal  would have been as compared to the we achieved for fiscal this increase primarily reflects a significantly higher percentage of consolidated net sales occurring in our telecommunications transmission segment which historically achieved a higher gross profit percentage than our other two reportable operating segments and an overall better sales mix in our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
gross profit  as a percentage of related segment sales is further discussed below 
our telecommunications transmission segment gross profit  as a percentage of related net sales  for fiscal  was higher than the percentage achieved for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to better than expected performance related to our north african government and middle eastern government over the horizon microwave system contracts and an overall favorable sales mix 
gross margins in our telecommunications transmission segment during fiscal reflect lower production  as compared to fiscal  of mts and bft products for our mobile data communications segment which  in turn  sells them to the us army 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment experienced a higher gross profit  both in dollars and as a percentage of related net sales  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase is attributable to an improvement in overall sales mix  including fewer developmental projects in fiscal as compared to fiscal our mobile data communications segment gross profit  as a percentage of related net sales  for fiscal was slightly higher as compared to fiscal during fiscal  this segment gross profit benefited by approximately million related to the finalization of pricing for certain previously received mts and bft orders 
excluding this benefit  our mobile data communications segment gross profit  as a percentage of related net sales  for fiscal would have been lower than the level we achieved for fiscal  primarily due to a change in overall sales mix and a charge of million of the million restructuring charge associated with our decision to wind down our microsatellite product line 
our fiscal gross profit in this segment also reflects the benefit from million of revenue we recorded related to the annual million intellectual property license fee that we collected in fiscal pursuant to our two year million bft idiq sustainment contract with the us army 
included in consolidated cost of sales for fiscal and are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage assumptions 

index selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal reflects a net expense of million  consisting of i million of restructuring costs associated with the wind down of our microsatellite product line  ii million of professional fees associated with a withdrawn contested proxy solicitation related to our fiscal annual meeting of stockholders  offset  in part  by iii a million benefit relating to a change in the fair value of a contingent earn out liability associated with our acquisition of stampede 
excluding the net expense of million  our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal would have been million  or of respective fiscal sales and would have decreased by million as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in i compensation related expenses associated with a lower level of consolidated net sales during fiscal and ii lower depreciation expense related to certain mobile data communications segment fixed assets fully depreciated in fiscal due to the expiration of our mts contract 
this decrease was partially offset by increased legal costs and professional fees associated with legal proceedings and other matters  including certain matters discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note b commitments and contingencies legal proceedings and other matters included in part ii
