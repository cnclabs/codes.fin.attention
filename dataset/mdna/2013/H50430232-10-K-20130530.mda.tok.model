table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth above in item a  risk factors  and below in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview of our company logitech is a world leader in products that connect people to the digital experiences they care about 
spanning multiple computing  communication and entertainment platforms  we develop and market innovative hardware and software products that enable or enhance digital navigation  music and video entertainment  gaming  social networking  and audio and video communication over the internet 
we have two operating segments peripherals and video conferencing 
our peripherals segment encompasses the design  manufacturing and marketing of peripherals for pcs personal computers  tablets and other digital platforms 
our products for home and business pcs include mice  trackballs  keyboards  interactive gaming controllers  multimedia speakers  headsets and webcams 
our tablet accessory products include keyboards  keyboard cases and covers  headsets  wireless speakers  earphones and stands 
our internet communications products include webcams  headsets  video communications services  and digital video security systems 
our digital music products include speakers  earphones and custom in ear monitors 
for home entertainment systems  we offer the harmony line of advanced remote controls 
our gaming products include a range of gaming controllers and microphones  as well as other accessories 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we identified a number of product categories that no longer fit with our current strategic direction 
as a result  we made a strategic decision to divest our retail remote product category and our digital video security product line  included within our retail video product category  and we plan to discontinue other non strategic products  such as speaker docks and most console gaming peripherals  by the end of fiscal year this decision primarily resulted from our belief that these categories of products would not make a meaningful contribution to improve our growth or profitability 
our brand  portfolio management  product definition and engineering teams in our peripherals segment are responsible for product strategy  technological innovation  product design and development  and bringing our products to market 
our business groups are organized by the following product categories pointing devices  pc keyboards desktops  tablet accessories  audio pc  audio wearables wireless  video  pc gaming  and remotes 
our global marketing organization is responsible for developing and building the logitech brand  consumer insight  public relations and social media  customer care and digital marketing 
our regional retail sales and marketing activities are organized into three geographic areas americas including north and south america  emea europe  middle east  africa and asia pacific including  among other countries  china  taiwan  japan and australia 
we sell our peripheral products to a network of distributors  retailers and oems 
our worldwide retail network includes wholesale distributors  consumer electronics retailers  mass merchandisers  specialty electronics stores  computer and telecommunications stores  value added resellers and online merchants 
sales of peripherals to our retail channels were and of our net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and the large majority of our revenues have historically been derived from sales of our peripheral products for use by consumers 
our oem customers include the majority of the world largest pc manufacturers 
sales to oem customers were and of our net sales for the fiscal years ended march  and our video conferencing segment encompasses the design  manufacturing and marketing of video conferencing products  infrastructure and services for the enterprise  public sector  and other business 
table of contents markets 
video conferencing products include scalable hd high definition video communication endpoints  hd video conferencing systems with integrated monitors  video bridges and other infrastructure software and hardware to support large scale video deployments  and services to support these products 
the video conferencing segment maintains a separate marketing and sales organization which sells lifesize products and services worldwide 
video conferencing product development and product management organizations are separate  but coordinated with our peripherals business  particularly our consumer computing platform group 
we sell our lifesize products and services to distributors  value added resellers  oems  and occasionally  direct enterprise customers 
sales of lifesize products were of our net sales in the fiscal years ended march  and during fiscal year  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to our video conferencing segment 
we seek to fulfill the increasing demand for interfaces between people and the expanding digital world across multiple platforms and user environments 
the interface evolves as platforms  user models and our target markets evolve 
as access to digital information has expanded  we have extended our focus to mobile devices  the digital home  and the enterprise as access points to the internet and the digital world 
all of these platforms require interfaces that are customized according to how the devices are used 
we believe that continued investment in product research and development is critical to creating the innovation required to strengthen our competitive advantage and to drive future sales growth 
we are committed to identifying and meeting current and future consumer trends with new and improved product technologies  partnering with others where our strengths are complementary  as well as leveraging the value of the logitech and lifesize brands from a competitive  channel partner and consumer experience perspective 
we believe innovation and product quality are important to gaining market acceptance and maintaining market leadership 
we have been expanding the categories of products we sell and entering new markets  such as the markets for tablet accessories 
as we do so  we are confronting new competitors  many of which have more experience in the categories or markets and have greater marketing resources and brand name recognition than we have 
in addition  because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics  we expect greater competition in the future from well established consumer electronics companies in our new categories as well as future ones we might enter 
many of these companies have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than we have 
our peripherals and video conferencing industries are intensely competitive 
the peripherals industry is characterized by platform evolution  short product life cycles  continual performance enhancements  and rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors in our retail markets  and price sensitivity in the oem market 
we experience aggressive price competition and other promotional activities from our primary competitors and from less established brands  including brands owned by some retail customers known as house brands  in response to declining consumer demand in both mature retail and oem markets 
we may also encounter more competition if any of our competitors in one or more categories decide to enter other categories in which we currently operate 
from time to time  we may seek to partner with or acquire  when appropriate  companies that have products  personnel  and technologies that complement our strategic direction 
we continually review our product offerings and our strategic direction in light of our profitability targets  competitive conditions  changing consumer trends  and the evolving nature of the interface between the consumer and the digital world 
summary of financial results our total net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased  compared with the fiscal year ended march   due to the continued decline in retail  as well as oem and video conferencing sales 

table of contents retail sales during the fiscal year ended march  decreased and retail units sold decreased  compared with the fiscal year ended march  we experienced declines in all retail regions  decline in the americas region  decline in the emea region  and decline in the asia pacific region 
if foreign currency exchange rates had been the same in the fiscal year ended march  and  the percentage changes in our constant dollar retail sales would have been a decrease of in the americas regions  in the emea region  and in the asia pacific region 
sales incentive spending including pricing discounts during fiscal year ended march   compared with fiscal year ended march   decreased by due to lower sell through during this period 
sales returns expense during fiscal year ended march   compared with fiscal year ended march   decreased by due to lower channel inventory aging during this period 
sales of video conferencing products  which were of total net sales in each of the fiscal years ended march  and  decreased by in the fiscal year ended march   compared with the prior fiscal year  due to sales declines in all geographic regions 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  remained relatively constant at  compared with for the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we benefitted from gross margin improvement primarily due to the absence of an inventory valuation adjustment related to logitech revue and related peripherals which occurred during fiscal year  and from improvements to our channel pricing program and global supply chain process 
these improvements were almost entirely offset by an unfavorable change in retail product mix  the negative impact of a weaker euro  a charge to revalue our inventory of several headphones and a large form factor wireless speaker included in our audio wearables wireless retail product category  actions related to the simplification of our product portfolio and restructuring related costs 
operating expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were of net sales  compared with in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily attributable to a million goodwill impairment charge related to our video conferencing reporting unit and from million in costs related to restructuring plans we implemented in fiscal year net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was million  compared with net income of million in the fiscal year ended march  this decline primarily resulted from the million goodwill impairment charge and the million in restructuring charges  offset in part by a discrete tax benefit of million from the closure of federal income tax examinations in the united states 
trends in our business our sales of pc peripherals for use by consumers in the americas and europe have historically made up the large majority of our revenues 
in the last two years  the pc market has changed dramatically and there continues to be significant weakness in the global market for new pcs 
this weakness has had a negative impact on our net sales in all of our pc related categories 
we believe that this weakness reflects the growing popularity of tablets and smartphones as mobile computing devices 
we believe logitech future growth will be determined by our ability to rapidly create innovative products across multiple digital platforms  especially accessories for mobility related products  including tablets  smartphones and other mobile devices  and for digital music  including wireless speakers and wearables such as earphones  to limit and offset the decline in our pc peripherals and to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets  mobility related products  products for digital music and sales to enterprise markets 
the following discussion represents key trends specific to each of our two operating segments  peripherals and video conferencing 

table of contents trends specific to our peripherals segment mature and emerging markets 
in our traditional  mature markets  such as north america  western and northern europe  japan  and australia  although the installed base of pc users is large  consumer demand for pcs has declined in recent years  and we believe it will continue to decline in future years 
as a consequence  consumer demand for pc peripherals is slowing  or in some case declining 
while we continue to pursue growth opportunities in select pc peripheral product lines in mature markets  we believe there are growth opportunities for our pc peripherals outside the mature markets 
we have invested significantly in growing the number of our sales  marketing and administrative personnel in china  our largest target emerging market  with the result that china was our third largest country in retail sales for fiscal ended march  we are also expanding our presence in other emerging markets 
enterprise market 
we are continuing our efforts on creating and selling products and services to enterprises 
we believe the preferences of employees increasingly drive companies choices in the information technologies they deploy to their employee base 
growing our enterprise peripherals business will continue to require investment in selected business specific products  targeted product marketing  and sales channel development 
tablets  smartphones and other mobile devices 
the increasing popularity of smaller  mobile computing devices  such as tablets and smartphones with touch interfaces  have created new markets and usage models for peripherals and accessories 
logitech has begun to offer products to enhance the use of mobile devices 
for example  we are experiencing strong demand for our tablet keyboards  led by our logitech ultrathin keyboard cover  which currently represents our best selling product across all of our product categories 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also introduced the logitech ultrathin keyboard mini  a slim protective keyboard cover designed to enhance the ipad mini experience 
initial demand for the logitech ultrathin keyboard mini has been very positive 
the tablets and accessories category is one of the primary strategic categories of our business 
we continue to expand and leverage on our success in this category through the introduction of innovative products such as the logitech keyboard folio and folio mini  and the logitech fabricskin keyboard folio for ipad and ipad  announced in late march and april digital music 
we believe that digital music  the seamless consumption of audio content on home and mobile devices  presents a growth opportunity for logitech  based on our history of successful earphone  headset and speaker products 
many consumers listen to music as a pervasive entertainment activity  fueled by the growth in smartphones  tablets  music services and internet radio 
logitech has a solid foundation of audio solutions to satisfy consumers needs for music consumption  including logitech ue earphones and digital music speakers 
oem business 
sales of our oem mice and keyboards have historically made up the bulk of our oem sales 
in recent years  there has been a dramatic shift away from desktop pcs and there continues to be significant weakness in the global market for pcs which has adversely affected our sales of oem mice and keyboards  all of which are sold with name brand desktop pcs 
we expect this trend to continue and for oem sales to comprise a smaller percentage of our total revenues in the future 
trends in other peripheral product categories 
some of our other peripherals product categories are experiencing significant market challenges 
as the quality of pc embedded webcams improves  we expect future sales of our pc connected webcams in mature consumer markets to continue declining 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we identified a number of product categories that no longer fit with our current strategic direction 
as a result  we made a strategic decision to divest our entire retail remotes product category and our digital video security product line included in our retail video product category  and we plan to discontinue other non strategic products  such as speaker docks and most console gaming peripherals  by the end of fiscal year 
table of contents trends specific to our video conferencing segment the trend among businesses and institutions to use video conferencing offers a long term growth opportunity for logitech 
however  the overall video conferencing industry has experienced a slowdown in recent quarters 
in addition  there has been an increase in the competitive environment in fiscal year this resulted in a million non cash goodwill impairment charge in the fiscal year ended march  we believe the growth in our video conferencing segment depends in part on our ability to increase sales to enterprises with existing installed bases of equipment supplied by our competitors  and to enterprises that may purchase such competitor equipment in the future 
we believe the ability of our lifesize products to interoperate with the equipment of other telecommunications  video conferencing or telepresence equipment suppliers to be a key factor in purchasing decisions by current or prospective lifesize customers 
in addition  lifesize has broadened its product portfolio to include infrastructure  cloud services and other offerings which require different approaches to developing customer solutions 
we also are seeking to offer lifesize products designed to enhance the use of mobile devices in video conferencing applications 
emerging market 
china also represents a significant targeted emerging market for our video conferencing segment 
we have invested significantly in growing the number of our video conferencing sales  marketing and administrative personnel in china 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate critical if it i requires management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  and ii is important to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although these estimates are based on management best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact us in the future  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to our business operations and to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for customer programs we record accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and pricing programs 
an allowance against accounts receivable is recorded for accruals and program activity related to our direct customers and those indirect customers who receive payments for program activity through our direct customers 
an accrued liability is recorded for accruals and program activity related to our indirect customers who receive payments directly and do not have a right of offset against a receivable balance 
the estimated cost of these programs is recorded as a reduction of revenue or as an operating expense  if we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
returns 
we grant limited rights to return products 
return rights vary by customer  and range from just the right to return defective product to stock rotation rights limited to a percentage approved by 
table of contents management 
estimates of expected future product returns are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical return trends by customer and by product  inventories owned by and located at distributors and retailers  current customer demand  current operating conditions  and other relevant customer and product information 
return trends are influenced by product life cycle status  new product introductions  market acceptance of products  sales levels  product sell through  the type of customer  seasonality  product quality issues  competitive pressures  operational policies and procedures and other factors 
return rates can fluctuate over time  but are sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns 
cooperative marketing arrangements 
we enter into customer marketing programs with many of our distribution and retail customers  and with certain indirect partners  allowing customers to receive a credit equal to a set percentage of their purchases of our products  or a fixed dollar credit for various marketing arrangements 
the objective of these arrangements is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for these marketing arrangements are recorded at the time of sale  or time of commitment  based on negotiated terms  historical experience and inventory levels in the channel 
customer incentive programs 
customer incentive programs include performance based incentives and consumer rebates 
we offer performance based incentives to our distribution customers  retail customers and indirect partners based on pre determined performance criteria 
accruals for performance based incentives are recognized as a reduction of the sale price at the time of sale 
estimates of required accruals are determined based on negotiated terms  consideration of historical experience  anticipated volume of future purchases  and inventory levels in the channel 
consumer rebates are offered from time to time at the company discretion for the primary benefit of end users 
estimated costs of consumer rebates and similar incentives are recorded at the time the incentive is offered  based on the specific terms and conditions 
certain incentive programs  including consumer rebates  require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular programs 
pricing programs 
we have agreements with certain of our customers that contain terms allowing price protection credits to be issued in the event of a subsequent price reduction 
at management discretion  we also offer special pricing discounts to certain customers 
special pricing discounts are usually offered only for limited time periods or for sales of selected products to specific indirect partners 
our decision to make price reductions is influenced by product life cycle stage  market acceptance of products  the competitive environment  new product introductions and other factors 
estimates of expected future pricing actions are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical pricing actions by customer and by product  inventories owned by and located at distributors and retailers  current customer demand  current operating conditions  and other relevant customer and product information  such as stage of product life cycle 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and pricing programs 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take action to increase such programs 
in addition  when the variables used to estimate these costs change  or if actual costs differ significantly from the estimates  we would be required to record incremental increases or reductions to revenue or increase operating expenses 
if  at any future time  we become unable to reasonably estimate these costs  recognition of revenue might be deferred until products are sold to end users  which would adversely impact revenue in the period of transition 
inventory valuation we must order components for our products and build inventory in advance of customer orders 
further  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 

table of contents we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value and record write downs of inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand or market value 
a review of inventory is performed each fiscal quarter that considers factors including the marketability and product life cycle stage  product development plans  component cost trends  demand forecasts and current sales levels 
we identify inventory exposures by comparing inventory on hand  in the channel and on order to historical and forecasted sales over forecasted sales periods 
inventory on hand which is not expected to be sold or utilized based on review of forecasted sales and utilization is considered excess  and we recognize the write off in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
the write off is determined by comparison of the current replacement cost with the estimated selling price less any costs of completion and disposal net realizable value and the net realizable value less an allowance for normal profit 
at the time of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances would not result in an increase in the cost basis 
if there were an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for logitech products or an unanticipated change in technological or customer requirements  we may be required to record additional write downs which could adversely affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded 
share based compensation expense share based compensation expense includes compensation expense  reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the grant date fair value for stock options and stock purchase rights is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model 
the grant date fair value of rsus restricted stock units which vest upon meeting certain market conditions is estimated using the monte carlo simulation method 
the grant date fair value of time based rsus is calculated based on the share market price on the date of grant 
for stock options and restricted stock assumed by logitech when lifesize was acquired  the grant date used to estimate fair value was deemed to be december   the date of acquisition 
compensation expense for awards granted or assumed after april  is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of the award 
our estimates of share based compensation expense require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures  dividend yield  related tax effects and the selection of an appropriate fair value model 
we estimate expected share price volatility based on historical volatility using daily prices over the term of past options  rsus or purchase offerings  as we consider historical share price volatility as most representative of future volatility 
we estimate expected life based on historical settlement rates  which we believe are most representative of future exercise and post vesting termination behaviors 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures  and we record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and future expectations of dividend payouts 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation expense and related tax effects represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future from what we have recorded in the current period  which could materially affect our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes logitech operates in multiple jurisdictions and its profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions 
our effective income tax rate may be affected by the changes in or interpretations of tax laws and tax agreements in any given jurisdiction  utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  changes in geographical mix of income and expense  and changes in our assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
as a result of these considerations  we must estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax exposure 
table of contents together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  considering all available evidence such as historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies 
when we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment is charged to earnings in the period when such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
we make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax law  the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters surrounding the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax benefits 
in the event that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates  or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes  we will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur 
such adjustments may have a material impact on our income tax provision and our results of operations 
goodwill we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of each reporting unit as of december and complete the assessment during our fiscal fourth quarter  or more frequently  if certain events or circumstances warrant 
events or changes in circumstances which might indicate potential impairment in goodwill include the company specific factors  including  but not limited to  stock price volatility  market capitalization relative to net book value  and projected revenue  market growth and operating results 
determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we have two reporting units peripherals and video conferencing 
the allocation of assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units also involves judgment and assumptions 
the goodwill impairment assessment involves three tests  step  step and step the step test involves performing an initial qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired and thus whether it is necessary to proceed to step and calculate the fair value of the respective reporting unit 
we may proceed directly to the step test without performing the step test 
the step test involves measuring the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit carrying amount  including goodwill  to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value is estimated using an income approach employing a discounted cash flow dcf and a market based model 
the dcf model is based on projected cash flows from our most recent forecast assessment forecast developed in connection with each of our reporting units to perform the goodwill impairment assessment 
the assessment forecast is based on a number of key assumptions  including  but not limited to  discount rate  compound annual growth rate cagr during the forecast period  and terminal value 
the terminal value is based on an exit price at the end of the assessment forecast using an earnings multiple applied to the final year of the assessment forecast 
the discount rate is applied to the projected cash flows to reflect the risks inherent in the timing and amount of the projected cash flows  including the terminal value  and is derived from the weighted average cost of capital of market participants in similar businesses 
the market approach model was based on applying certain revenue and earnings multiples of comparable companies relevant to each of our reporting units to the respective revenue and earnings metrics of our reporting units 
to test the reasonableness of the fair values indicated by the income approach and the market based approach  we also assessed the implied premium of the aggregate fair value over the market capitalization considered attributable to an acquisition control premium  which is the price in excess of a stock market price that investors would typically pay to gain control of an entity 
the discounted cash flow model and the market approach require 
table of contents the exercise of significant judgment  including assumptions about appropriate discount rates  long term growth rates for purposes of determining a terminal value at the end of the discrete forecast period  economic expectations  timing of expected future cash flows  and expectations of returns on equity that will be achieved 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value as determined by these assessments  goodwill is considered impaired  and the step test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the step test measures the impairment loss by allocating the reporting unit fair value to its assets and liabilities other than goodwill  comparing the resulting implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount  and recording an impairment charge for the difference 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis of each of our reporting units as of december  using the income approach and market approach described above 
we chose not to perform the step test and to proceed directly to the step test 
this assessment resulted in us determining that our peripherals reporting unit passed the step test because the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 
by contrast  our video conferencing reporting unit failed the step test because the estimated fair value was less than its carrying value  thus requiring a step assessment of this reporting unit 
this impairment primarily resulted from a decrease in our expected cagr during the assessment forecast period based on greater evidence of the overall enterprise video conferencing industry experiencing a slowdown in recent quarters  combined with lower demand related to new product launches  increased competition in fiscal year and other market data 
these factors had an adverse effect on our recent video conferencing operating results and are anticipated to have an adverse effect on its future business 
peripherals key assumptions used in the step income approach analyses for our peripherals reporting unit included the appropriate discount rates  cagr during the forecast period  and long term growth rates for purposes of determining a terminal value at the end of the discrete forecast period 
sensitivity assessment of key assumptions for the peripherals reporting unit step test is presented below 
discount rate assumptions 
a hypothetical percentage increase of in the discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would not have decreased the fair value of the peripherals reporting unit below its carrying value  and thus it would not result in the reporting unit failing step of the goodwill impairment test 
cagr assumptions 
a hypothetical percentage decrease of in the cagr rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would not have decreased the fair value of the peripherals reporting unit below its carrying value 
terminal value assumptions 
a hypothetical percentage decrease of in the terminal value  holding all other assumptions constant  would not have decreased the fair value of the peripherals reporting unit below its carrying value 
video conferencing key assumptions used in the step income approach analyses for our video conferencing reporting unit also included the appropriate discount rates  cagr during the forecast period  and long term growth rates for purposes of determining a terminal value at the end of the discrete forecast period 
both the income and market approaches arrived at estimated fair values within a relatively close range  which supported the reasonableness of each assessment 
we proceeded with a step assessment because the estimated fair value of our video conferencing reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
the step test required us to fair value all assets and liabilities of our video conferencing reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of this reporting unit goodwill 
we were unable to fully complete the step analysis prior to filing of our form q for the quarterly period ended december  due to the complexities 
table of contents of determining the implied fair value of goodwill of our video conferencing reporting unit 
based on our work performed during the third quarter of fiscal year  we initially recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of million during that period 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment and recorded an additional million in goodwill impairment charge related to our video conferencing reporting unit 
the total goodwill impairment charge of million had no cash flow impact 
applicable to both reporting units we continue to evaluate and monitor all key factors impacting the carrying value of our recorded goodwill  as well as other long lived assets 
there are a number of uncertainties associated with the key assumptions described above based primarily on the difficulty of predicting our revenues and profitability 
our revenues and profitability are difficult to predict due to the nature of the markets in which we compete  fluctuating end user demand  the uncertainty of current and future global economic conditions  and for many other reasons  including  but not limited to our revenues are impacted by end user consumer demand and future global conditions  which could fluctuate abruptly and significantly during periods of uncertain economic conditions or geographic distress  as well as from shifts in consumer buying patterns 
we must incur a large portion of our costs in advance of sales orders  because we must plan research and production  order components  buy tooling equipment  and enter into development  sales and marketing  and other operating commitments prior to obtaining firm commitments from our customers 
this makes it difficult for us to rapidly adjust our costs in response to a revenue shortfall 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates can impact our revenues  expenses and profitability because we report our financial statements in us dollars  whereas a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are in other currencies 
the peripherals industry is characterized by short product life cycles  frequent new product introductions  rapidly changing technology  dynamic consumer demand and evolving industry standards 
as a result  we must continually innovate in our new and existing product categories  introduce new products and technologies  and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive 
the video conferencing industry is characterized by continual performance enhancements and large  well financed competitors 
there is increased participation in the video conferencing market by companies such as cisco systems  inc and polycom  inc  and as a result  we expect competition in the industry to further intensify 
should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of the reporting units to be significantly different in future periods 

table of contents results of operations net sales net sales by channel for fiscal years  and were as follows in thousands change year ended march  vs vs peripherals retail oem total peripherals video conferencing total net sales our retail sales decreased and retail units sold decreased in fiscal year  compared with the prior fiscal year 
we experienced declines in all three regions during fiscal year our overall retail average selling price declined in fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year 
our retail sales in fiscal year were essentially flat compared with fiscal year  as the retail sales increase in the asia pacific region was offset by declines in the emea and americas regions 
retail units sold increased in fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year 
our overall retail average selling price declined in fiscal year compared with the prior fiscal year

if foreign currency exchange rates had been the same in fiscal years and  our constant dollar retail sales would have decreased 
oem net sales decreased and and units sold decreased in fiscal years and  compared with the preceding fiscal years

retail sales of pc keyboards desktops increased during the year ended march   compared with the prior fiscal year  while units sold decreased during this period 
although this category was affected by the continued weakness in the global pc market  we managed to achieve a modest sales increase in this category due to continued development of new  innovative products led by the logitech wireless touch k  and from other new products  including the logitech washable keyboard k  logitech wireless combo mk  logitech bluetooth illuminated keyboard k and the logitech wireless solar keyboard for mac

retail tablet accessories our retail tablet accessories category is comprised of our tablet keyboards and accessories 
retail tablet accessories represented our strongest product category with sales and unit increases of and during fiscal year  compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was driven by continued strong demand for the logitech ultrathin keyboard cover  which currently represents our best selling product across all of our categories 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we also introduced the logitech ultrathin keyboard mini  a slim protective keyboard cover designed to enhance the ipad mini experience 
initial demand for the logitech ultrathin keyboard mini has been very positive 
the tablets and accessories category is one of the primary strategic categories of our business 
we continue to expand and leverage on our success in this category through the introduction of newly innovative products such as the logitech keyboard folio and folio mini  and the logitech fabricskin keyboard folio for ipad and ipad  announced in late march and april by geography  we experienced strong growth in all regions  led by the emea region where sales and units sold increased by and  followed by the asia pacific region where sales and units sold increased by and  and by the americas region where sales and units sold increased by and during this period

retail audio pc sales and units sold decreased and during fiscal year  compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was due to sales and unit declines of and in pc speakers and sales and unit declines of and in pc headsets 
these declines reflect both weakness in the overall market for new pcs  a market shift towards mobile audio devices  and a product line that has not been meaningfully refreshed in over a year

retail audio wearables wireless our retail audio wearables wireless category is comprised of non pc audio products  including ear and headphones  and wireless speakers 

table of contents retail audio wearables wireless sales increased during fiscal year  compared with the prior fiscal year  while retail units sold increased during this period 
the increase in sales during fiscal year was from a increase in our wireless speakers for smartphones and tablets 
we experienced strong initial sales from our new wireless speakers including the logitech ue mobile boombox and logitech ue boombox  both of which began shipping late in the second quarter of fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  this category was negatively impacted by very weak demand for the logitech ue boombox 
the poor sales performance of this product was due to a lack of competitive differentiation and a form factor that has proved to be too large for many consumers 
contrasting  sales continued to be strong for our smaller  lower cost logitech ue mobile boombox 
sales of our audio wearables products were flat during fiscal year  compared to the prior fiscal year 
we initially experienced strong sales in audio wearables during fiscal year  driven in part by the strong initial sales of the new logitech ue products which were initially available exclusively through apple stores during the second quarter of fiscal year during the third quarter of fiscal year  audio wearables sales were negatively impacted by our participation in an aggressive black friday promotion of our ue earphones with a large us online retailer in the same period of the prior fiscal year 
this year we chose not to participate in similarly aggressive promotions for our new music products launched under the logitech ue brand  which caused our sales to decline substantially during the three months ended december   as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 
audio wearables sales continued to decline during the fourth quarter of fiscal year despite exceptional product quality and consistently positive reviews  we have discovered that this category requires a significant marketing investment to drive lifestyle brand appeal 
we chose not to increase our marketing spend to the level that would be required to clearly distinguish our brand from the competition in the minds of the consumer  which has had an adverse effect on the sales of this category 
by geography  we experienced growth in the asia pacific region  where sales and units sold increased by and  and in the americas region  where sales and units sold increased by and 
these increases were offset in part by weakness in the emea region  where sales and units sold decreased by and 
china contributed significantly to the strong performance in the asia pacific region where sales and units sold increased by and during this period

sales of our wireless speaker products increased by in sales and in units sold during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily driven by strong sales from our then newly introduced logitech mini boombox and logitech wireless boombox

retail video sales declined by during fiscal year  compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year  while retail units sold decreased during this period 
the sales decrease was mainly due to weakness in our webcam product line  which declined by during this period  and which continued to be negatively impacted by the combination of market trends  including the popularity of embedded webcams in mobile devices  and the overall weakness of the pc market 
we expect future sales of our usb cable connected consumer webcams in the consumer market to continue declining  as the embedded webcam experience appears to be sufficient to meet the needs of many retail consumers 
we experienced strong growth in the high end category driven by the logitech hd pro webcam c  which offers full hd p video calls on skype  and from logitech bcc conference cam for the enterprise 
table of contents market during fiscal year the retail video sales decrease was also due to a decline in our digital video security products during this period 
we made a strategic decision to divest our digital video security category of products by the end of fiscal year these decreases were offset in part by a increase in our tv cam product line driven by strong initial sales from logitech tv cam hd which began shipping during the third quarter of fiscal year we experienced declines in all geographic regions during this period

china sales and units sold decreased by and during this period 
retail video sales decreased and unit sold decreased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this sales decline was mainly due to weakness in our webcam product line  which decreased in sales and in units sold during this period 
our webcam product line continued to be negatively impacted by the combination of market trends and gaps in this product portfolio 
in fiscal year  we enhanced this product line by enabling experiences that cannot be easily achieved with an embedded webcam 
for example  we experienced strong growth with our initial launch of the logitech hd pro webcam c  which offers full hd p video calls on skype  in the latter part of the fiscal year the sales decline in our webcams was offset in part by strong performance from our video security products  which experienced increases of in sales and in units sold during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year geographically  the americas region led the decline with sales and unit decreases of and  followed by the emea region with sales and unit decreases of and 
these decreases were offset in part by increase in sales and units sold in the asia pacific region of and during this period 
china contributed significantly to the solid performance in the asia pacific region with sales and unit increases of and during this period 
retail pc gaming our retail pc gaming category is comprised of pc gaming mice  keyboards  headsets and steering wheels 
retail sales of our pc gaming category declined during fiscal year  compared with the prior fiscal year  while retail units sold decreased 
during fiscal year  we experienced a decline in almost all our pc gaming categories  with the most significant decline in our steering wheel product category 
these declines were offset in part by strong sales from select gaming products including logitech g mmo gaming mouse  logitech g mechanical gaming keyboard  and logitech g wireless gaming headsets 
the difference between the decline in pc gaming sales and the decrease in units sold during fiscal year reflects a product mix shift away from higher priced steering wheels to lower priced mice  keyboards and gamepads 
the overall decline in this category primarily reflects an aging product line up that we have started addressing 
for instance  in late march  we announced the launch of eight new gaming products  including mice  keyboards and headsets 
pc gaming sales in the americas  emea and asia pacific regions decreased by  and in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year china sales and units sold decreased by and during this period

the high end category experienced a less steep decrease of decrease during this period due to the launch of harmony touch in october  our first new high end remote in over four years 
the significantly steeper decline in units sold  relative to sales  primarily reflects our transition over the last several quarters away from selling low to mid range remotes

during fiscal year  we experienced gross margin improvement from a valuation adjustment related to logitech revue and related peripherals which occurred during fiscal year  and from the improvements to our channel pricing program and global supply chain process

marketing and selling expense increased in fiscal year compared with the same period of the prior fiscal year 
we experienced increased advertising  product design  consulting and marketing expenses associated with the launch of new products  which were partially offset by decreases in personnel related expenses and share based compensation expense from restructuring plans we implemented in fiscal year marketing and selling expense increased in fiscal year compared with  primarily from higher personnel related expenses resulting from increased headcount for lifesize  the enterprise market team  and the asia pacific region  higher infrastructure costs to support the additional headcount  and the settlement of a customer bankruptcy dispute

impairment of goodwill and other assets while performing our annual goodwill impairment analysis of each of our reporting units as of december   we determined that our video conferencing reporting unit estimated fair value was less than its carrying value  thus requiring a step assessment of this reporting unit 
this impairment primarily resulted from a decrease in our expected cagr during the assessment forecast period based on greater evidence of the overall enterprise video conferencing industry experiencing a slowdown in recent quarters  combined with lower demand related to new product launches  increased competition in fiscal year and other market data 
the step test required us to fair value all assets and liabilities of our video conferencing reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of this reporting unit goodwill

as of march   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest and penalties due to uncertain tax positions was million  of which million would affect the effective income tax rate if realized

at this time  we are not able to estimate the potential impact that these examinations may have on income tax expense 
if the examinations are resolved unfavorably  there is a possibility they may have a material negative impact on our results of operations 
although we have adequately provided for uncertain tax positions  the provisions on these positions may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the decrease of the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
liquidity and capital resources cash balances  available borrowings  and capital resources at march   our working capital was million  compared with million at march  this decrease in working capital was due to lower cash balances  primarily resulting from the million cash dividend payment paid on september  and from the repurchase of million shares for million 
during the fiscal year  we generated million of cash flow from operating activities 
our main sources of operating cash flows were net loss after adding non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization  impairment of goodwill and other assets  investment impairment  share based compensation expense and inventory valuation adjustment  and from decreases in accounts receivables and inventories 
these sources of operating cash flows were offset in part by decreases in accounts payables and accrued liabilities and an increase in other assets

the credit facility may be used for working capital  general corporate purposes  and acquisitions 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at march  the credit facility matures on october  we may prepay the loans under the credit facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty 
borrowings under the credit facility will accrue interest at a per annum rate based on libor london interbank offered rate  or euribor euro interbank offered rate in the case of loans denominated in euros  plus a variable margin determined quarterly based on the ratio of senior debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the preceding four quarter period  plus  if applicable  an additional rate per annum intended to 
table of contents compensate the lenders for the cost of compliance with regulatory reserve requirements and other banking regulations 
we also pay a quarterly commitment fee of of the applicable margin on the available commitment 
in connection with entering into the credit facility  we incurred non recurring fees totaling million  which are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the credit facility 
the facility agreement contains representations and covenants  including threshold financial covenants  and events of default customary in swiss credit markets 
affirmative covenants include covenants regarding reporting requirements  maintenance of insurance  maintenance of properties and compliance with applicable laws and regulations  and financial covenants that require the maintenance of net senior debt  interest cover and adjusted equity ratios determined in accordance with the terms of the facility 
negative covenants limit the ability of the company and its subsidiaries  among other things  to grant liens  make investments  incur debt  make restricted payments  enter into a merger or acquisition  or sell  transfer or dispose of assets  in each case subject to certain exceptions 
as of march   we were not in compliance with the interest cover ratio of this facility 
this situation resulted from the significant operating loss incurred during fiscal year we believe that this is only a short term situation 
until we are in compliance with all covenants  including the interest cover ratio  this facility is not available for our use 
this facility stipulates that  upon an uncured event of default under the facility  the lenders may declare all or a portion of the outstanding obligations payable by us to be immediately due and payable  terminate their commitments and exercise other rights and remedies provided for under the facility 
the events of default under the facility include  among other things  payment defaults  covenant defaults  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  cross defaults with certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events and events that have a material adverse effect as defined in the facility 
upon a change of control of the company  lenders whose commitments aggregate more than two thirds of the total commitments under the facility may terminate the commitments and declare all outstanding obligations to be due and payable 
we have credit lines with several european and asian banks totaling million as of march  as is common for businesses in european and asian countries  these credit lines are uncommitted and unsecured 
despite the lack of formal commitments from the banks  we believe that these lines of credit will continue to be made available because of our long standing relationships with these banks and our current financial condition 
at march   there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit 
there are no financial covenants or cross default provisions under these facilities 
the company also has credit lines related to corporate credit cards totaling million as of march  the outstanding borrowings under these credit lines are recorded in other current liabilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as we transact business in multiple foreign currencies  including exposure related to anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities 
table of contents denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
logitech transacts business in over currencies worldwide  of which the most significant to operations are the cny chinese renminbi  australian dollar  taiwanese dollar  euro  british pound  canadian dollar  japanese yen and mexican peso 
the functional currency of our operations is primarily the us dollar 
to a lesser extent  certain operations use the euro  cny  swiss franc  or the local currency of the country as their functional currencies 
accordingly  unrealized foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to the us dollar are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
the table below provides information about our underlying transactions that are sensitive to foreign exchange rate changes  primarily assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency  where the net exposure is greater than million at march  the table also presents the us dollar impact on earnings of a appreciation and a depreciation of the functional currency as compared with the transaction currency in thousands functional currency transaction currency net exposed long short currency position fx gain loss from appreciation of functional currency fx gain loss from depreciation of functional currency taiwanese dollar us dollar    canadian dollar us dollar  euro british pound  us dollar australian dollar  singapore dollar us dollar  us dollar indian rupee  swiss franc us dollar euro romanian new lei korean won us dollar euro polish zloty euro swedish krona japanese yen us dollar  mexican peso us dollar  chinese renminbi us dollar    long currency positions represent net assets being held in the transaction currency while short currency positions represent net liabilities being held in the transaction currency 
our principal manufacturing operations are located in china  with much of our component and raw material costs transacted in cny 
however  the functional currency of our chinese operating subsidiary is the us dollar as its sales and trade receivables are transacted in us dollars 
to hedge against any potential significant appreciation of the cny  we maintain a portion of our cash investments in cny denominated accounts 
at march   net liabilities held in cny totaled million 
we continue to evaluate the level of net assets held in cny relative to component and raw material purchases and interest rates on cash equivalents 
derivatives we enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our subsidiaries forecasted inventory purchases 
the primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we have designated these derivatives as cash flow hedges 
logitech does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or 
table of contents speculative purposes 
these hedging contracts generally mature within four months  and are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions 
gains and losses in the fair value of the effective portion of the hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged inventory purchases are sold  at which time the gains or losses are reclassified to cost of goods sold 
we assess the effectiveness of the hedges by comparing changes in the spot rate of the currency underlying the forward contract with changes in the spot rate of the currency in which the forecasted transaction will be consummated 
if the underlying transaction being hedged fails to occur or if a portion of the hedge does not generate offsetting changes in the foreign currency exposure of forecasted inventory purchases  we immediately recognize the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument in other income expense 
as of march   the notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding related to forecasted inventory purchases were million million 
deferred realized losses of million are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at march   and are expected to be reclassified to cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold 
deferred unrealized gains of million related to open cash flow hedges are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of march  and these forward contracts will be revalued in future periods until the related inventory is sold  at which time the resulting gains or losses will be reclassified to cost of goods sold 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the short term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables or payables 
these forward contracts generally mature within three months 
we may also enter into foreign exchange swap contracts to economically extend the terms of its foreign exchange forward contracts 
the primary risk managed by using forward and swap contracts is the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the gains or losses on foreign exchange forward contracts are recognized in earnings based on the changes in fair value 
cash flows from these contracts are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at march  relating to foreign currency receivables or payables were million 
open forward contracts as of march  consisted of contracts in us dollars to purchase taiwanese dollars and contract in euros to sell british pounds 
the notional amounts of foreign exchange swap contracts outstanding at march  were million 
swap contracts outstanding at march  consisted of contracts in mexican pesos  japanese yen and australian dollars 
unrealized net losses on the contracts outstanding at march  were million 
if the us dollar had appreciated by at march  compared with the foreign currencies in which we have forward or swap contracts  an unrealized gain of million in our forward foreign exchange contract portfolio would have occurred 
if the us dollar had depreciated by compared with the foreign currencies in which we have forward or swap contracts  a million unrealized loss in our forward foreign exchange contract portfolio would have occurred 
interest rates changes in interest rates could impact our future interest income on our cash equivalents and investment securities 
we prepared sensitivity analyses of our interest rate exposures to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on the results of these analyses  a basis point decrease or increase in interest rates from the march  and march  period end rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows
