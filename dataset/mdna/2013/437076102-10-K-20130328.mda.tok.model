table of contents results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this report 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks in fiscal net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion for fiscal the increase in net sales for fiscal reflects the impact of positive comparable store sales and billion of net sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal total comparable store sales increased for fiscal compared to an increase of for fiscal the positive comparable store sales for fiscal reflect a number of factors including the execution of our key initiatives and an improved us housing market

gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal  an increase of basis points 
the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal was driven primarily by a change in mix of products sold and benefits from our supply chain transformation in the us operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal sg a for fiscal included a million charge related to the china store closings

the results for fiscal included a million charge  net of tax  related to the china store closings as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
there were no adjustments for fiscal or for events of unusual nature or frequency 
we believe these non gaap financial measures better enable management and investors to understand and analyze our performance by providing them with meaningful information relevant to events of unusual nature or frequency that impact the comparability of underlying business results from period to period 
however  this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures

provision for income taxes our combined effective income tax rate decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the effective income tax rate for fiscal reflects a benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards as well as certain favorable state and local tax settlements 
diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were for fiscal compared to for fiscal diluted earnings per share for fiscal reflect of benefit from repurchases of our common stock in the twelve months ended january  liquidity and capital resources cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was billion compared to billion for fiscal this increase reflects a million increase in net earnings resulting from higher comparable store sales and expense controls 
in support of sales growth  we grew merchandise inventory 
the increase in inventory  net of the corresponding increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offsets the increase in operating cash flows generated by net earnings by million 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was billion compared to billion for fiscal this change was primarily due to a million increase in payments for businesses acquired  net  in fiscal compared to fiscal  no proceeds from sale of business  net  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal related to the sale of a non core carpet cleaning and cabinet refinishing business  and a million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was billion compared to billion for fiscal this change was primarily the result of how we funded our share repurchase program 
in fiscal  we repurchased billion of our outstanding shares of common stock using cash flow generated from operations 
in fiscal  we repurchased billion of our outstanding shares  and funded billion of those repurchases with proceeds from long term borrowings 
we did not issue any long term borrowings in fiscal the repurchases of common stock in fiscal were partially offset by million more in proceeds from sales of common stock due to increased stock option exercises in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we entered into asr agreements with third party financial institutions to repurchase billion of our common stock 
under the agreements  we paid billion to the financial institutions  using cash on hand  and received a total of million shares in fiscal also in fiscal  we repurchased million additional shares of our common stock for million through the open market 
since the inception of our share repurchase program in fiscal  we have repurchased billion shares of our common stock for a total of billion 
in february  our board of directors authorized a new billion share repurchase program that replaces the previous authorization 

table of contents in march  we issued billion of senior notes due april  at a discount of million and billion of senior notes due april  at a discount of million together  the march issuance 
interest on these senior notes is due semi annually on april and october of each year  beginning october  the net proceeds of the march issuance were used to repurchase billion of our common stock  and the balance of the net proceeds was used to repay our senior notes that matured march  in the aggregate principal amount of billion 
in connection with the march issuance  we entered into an asr agreement with a third party financial institution to repurchase billion of our common stock 
under the agreement  we paid billion to the financial institution and received a total of million shares in fiscal in march  we entered into an interest rate swap that expires on march   with a notional amount of million  accounted for as a fair value hedge  that swaps fixed rate interest on our senior notes due march  for variable interest equal to libor plus basis points 
at february   the approximate fair value of this agreement was an asset of million  which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreement 
also at february   we had outstanding interest rate swaps  accounted for as fair value hedges  that expire on december  with a notional amount of billion that swap fixed rate interest on our billion senior notes due december  for variable interest equal to libor plus basis points 
at february   the approximate fair value of these agreements was an asset of million  which is the estimated amount we would have received to settle the agreements 
we have commercial paper programs that allow for borrowings up to billion 
in connection with the programs  we have a back up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to billion 
as of february   there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper programs or the related credit facility 
the credit facility expires in july and contains various restrictive covenants 
as of february   we were in compliance with all of the covenants  and they are not expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our commercial paper programs and related credit facility 
we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate  including our stores  distribution centers and store support centers 
the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in long term debt and current installments of long term debt 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with the sale of hd supply on august   we guaranteed a billion senior secured amortizing term loan of hd supply 
the original expiration date of the guarantee was august  in march  we amended the guarantee to extend the expiration date to april  the fair value of the guarantee at august  was million and was recorded as a liability in other long term liabilities 
the extension of the guarantee increased the fair value of the guarantee to million  resulting in a million charge to interest and other  net  for fiscal in april  the term loan guarantee was terminated 
as a result  we reversed the million liability related to the guarantee  resulting in a million pretax benefit to interest and other  net  for fiscal as of february   we had billion in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our current cash position  access to the debt capital markets and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and fund dividend payments  share repurchases and any required long term debt payments through the next several fiscal years 
in addition  we have funds available from our commercial paper programs and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing 
in march  we entered into an asr agreement with a third party financial institution to repurchase billion of our common stock 
under the agreement  we will pay billion to the financial institution  using cash on hand  and receive an initial delivery of approximately million shares in the first quarter of fiscal the final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the agreement will be determined with reference to the average price of our common stock over the term of the asr agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  operating leases for a portion of our real estate and other assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of february  amounts in millions payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total thereafter total debt interest payments on debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total excludes present value of capital lease obligations  fair value of interest rate swaps and unamortized debt discounts 
interest payments are at current interest rates including the impact of active interest rate swaps 
includes million of imputed interest 
purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases  utility purchases  capital expenditures  software acquisitions and license commitments and legally binding service contracts 
purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above 
excludes million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate swap agreements are used  at times  to manage our fixed floating rate debt portfolio 
at february   after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreements  approximately of our debt portfolio was comprised of fixed rate debt and was floating rate debt 
a percentage point change in the interest costs of floating rate debt would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
as of february  we had  net of discounts  billion of senior notes outstanding 
the aggregate market value of these publicly traded senior notes as of february  was approximately billion 
although we have international operating entities  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition or results of operations 
impact of inflation  deflation and changing prices we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products 
we do not believe that changing prices for commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
although we cannot precisely determine the overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations  we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates 
revenues we recognize revenue  net of estimated returns and sales tax  at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services 
we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels 
we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns 
we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns 
however  if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts  our sales could be adversely impacted 
when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated 
table of contents balance sheets until the sale or service is complete 
we also record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize this revenue upon the redemption of gift cards in net sales 
merchandise inventories our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  with approximately valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under a cost method 
retailers like us  with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions  frequently use the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  merchandise inventories are stated at cost  which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories 
as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate our inventory valued under a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements as of the end of fiscal or independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated 
during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores  we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store by store basis 
shrink or in the case of excess inventory  swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory 
shrink may occur due to theft  loss  inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods  among other things 
we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories 
the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business 
actual shrink results did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal  or self insurance we have established liabilities for certain losses related to general liability including products liability  workers compensation  employee group medical and automobile claims for which we are self insured 
our self insured retention or deductible  as applicable  for each claim involving general liability  workers compensation and automobile liability is limited to million  million and million  respectively 
we do not have any stop loss limits for self insured employee group medical claims 
our liabilities represent estimates of the ultimate cost for claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liabilities are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
the liabilities are reviewed by management and third party actuaries on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  medical cost inflation or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
actual results related to these types of claims did not vary materially from estimated amounts for fiscal  or vendor allowances vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and advertising co op allowances for the promotion of vendors products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels 
these vendor allowances are accrued as earned  with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases 
we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendors 
volume rebates and certain advertising co op allowances earned are initially recorded as a reduction in merchandise inventories and a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold 
certain advertising co op allowances that are reimbursements of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense in sg a 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment 
indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses  management s decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the evaluation for long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows  which is generally the individual store level 

table of contents the assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated by comparing its undiscounted cash flows with its carrying value 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations  including gross margin on net sales  payroll and related items  occupancy costs  insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value 
impairment losses are recorded as a component of sg a in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
when a leased location closes  we also recognize in sg a the net present value of future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 
we make critical assumptions and estimates in completing impairment assessments of long lived assets 
our cash flow projections look several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as future sales and operating margin growth rates  economic conditions  market competition and inflation 
a decrease in the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the stores with indicators of impairment would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals of owned locations and estimates on the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased locations 
a decrease in estimated sublease income and a increase in the time required to sublease would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
we recorded impairments and lease obligation costs on closings and relocations in the ordinary course of business  as well as for the china store closings in fiscal  which were not material to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal  or goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we do not amortize goodwill but do assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year  or more often if indicators warrant  by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value 
we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments 
during fiscal  for all reporting units other than our china reporting unit  we used qualitative factors to determine that our goodwill balances for each reporting unit were not impaired 
for our china reporting unit  we recorded a charge of million to impair all of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit in fiscal impairment charges related to our remaining goodwill were not material for fiscal  or we amortize the cost of other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which range up to ten years  unless such lives are deemed indefinite 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment  or more often if indicators warrant 
impairment charges related to our other intangible assets were not material for fiscal  or recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no
