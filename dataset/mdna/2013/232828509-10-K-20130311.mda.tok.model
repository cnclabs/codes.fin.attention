item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the discussion under selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under the caption risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview cytrx corporation we are a biopharmaceutical research and development company specializing in oncology 
our oncology pipeline includes two programs in clinical development for cancer indications aldoxorubicin formerly known as inno and tamibarotene 
with our tumor targeted doxorubicin conjugate aldoxorubicin  we have initiated an international phase b clinical trial as a treatment for soft tissue sarcomas  completed a phase b clinical trial primarily in the same indication and initiated a phase b pharmacokinetics clinical trial in patients with metastatic solid tumors and a phase b study of aldoxorubicin in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors 
we held a positive meeting with the food and drug administration fda to discuss a potential phase pivotal trial as a therapy for patients with soft tissue sarcomas whose tumors have progressed following treatment with chemotherapy  and have submitted a special protocol assessment with respect to that potential trial 
tamibarotene is being tested in a double blind  placebo controlled  international phase b clinical trial in patients with non small cell lung cancer 
we completed our evaluation of a third drug candidate  bafetinib  in the enable phase clinical trial in high risk b cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia b cll  and plan to seek a partner for further development of bafetinib 
in order to fund our business and operations  we have relied primarily upon sales of our equity securities  sales of shares of common stock of our former rxi subsidiary and proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants 
we also have received limited funding from our strategic partners and licensees 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of million 
management believes that our current resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
the belief is based  in part  upon our currently projected expenditures for of approximately million  which includes approximately million for our clinical programs for aldoxorubicin  approximately million for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million for general operation of our clinical programs and approximately million for other general and administrative expenses 
these projected expenditures are based upon numerous assumptions and subject to many uncertainties  and our actual expenditures may be significantly different from these projections 
we will ultimately be required to obtain additional funding in order to execute our long term business plans  although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital 
we cannot assure that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional funding when needed  we may not be able to execute our business plans and our business may suffer  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our separation from rxi pharmaceuticals corporation rxi pharmaceuticals corporation now known as galena biopharma  inc was founded in april by us and four researchers in the field of rnai  including dr 
craig mello  recipient of the nobel prize for medicine for his co discovery of rnai 
in january  we transferred to rxi substantially all of our rnai related technologies and assets  and rxi began operating on a stand alone basis for the purpose of accelerating the discovery of rnai therapeutics previously sponsored by us 
rxi s initial focus is on developing rnai based product candidates for treating neurological and metabolic disorders and cancer 
on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of one share of rxi common stock for each outstanding share of our common stock  which was paid on march  and which reduced our ownership of rxi shares to less than 
on june   we sold million common shares of rxi and thereafter accounted for those shares as available for sale 
we sold our remaining shares of rxi common stock in december research and development expenditures for research and development activities related to continuing operations were million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and  or approximately  and  respectively  of our total expenses 
research and development expenses are further discussed below under critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations 
our currently projected expenditures for include approximately million for our clinical programs for aldoxorubicin  approximately million for our clinical program for tamibarotene and approximately million for general operation of our clinical programs 
the actual cost of our clinical programs could differ significantly from our current projections due to any additional requirements or delays imposed by the fda in connection with our planned trials  or if actual costs are higher than current management estimates for other reasons  including complications with manufacturing 
in the event that actual costs of our clinical program  or any of our other ongoing research activities  are significantly higher than our current estimates  we may be required to significantly modify our planned level of operations 
there is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce revenue because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development 
the successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any product candidate  due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of our ability to advance product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate and progress of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of our products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  stock options  impairment of long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  accrued liabilities and certain expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue consists of license fees from strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies as well as service and grant revenues 
service revenue consists of contract research and laboratory consulting 
grant revenues consist of government and private grants 
monies received for license fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting codification standards asc asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc 
milestone payments will be recognized upon achievement of the milestone as long as the milestone is deemed substantive and we have no other performance obligations related to the milestone and collectability is reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt  or recognized upon termination of the agreement and all related obligations 
deferred revenue represents amounts received prior to revenue recognition 
revenues from contract research  government grants  and consulting fees are recognized over the respective contract periods as the services are performed  provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
once all conditions of the grant are met and no contingencies remain outstanding  the revenue is recognized as grant fee revenue and an earned but unbilled revenue receivable is recorded 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for direct and overhead related research expenses and are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies  including licenses  that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
technology developed for use in its products is expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  include obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for its product candidates 
we recognize expenses for these activities based on a variety of factors  including actual and estimated labor hours  clinical site initiation activities  patient enrollment rates  estimates of external costs and other activity based factors 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
if our estimates are incorrect  clinical trial expenses recorded in any particular period could vary 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are described in note of the notes to our financial statements 
we follow the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees 
for stock options and stock warrants paid in consideration of services rendered by non employees  we recognize compensation expense in accordance with the requirements of asc  equity base payments to non employees asc 
non employee option grants that do not vest immediately upon grant are recorded as an expense over the vesting period 
at the end of each financial reporting period prior to performance  the value of these options  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  is determined  and compensation expense recognized or recovered during the period is adjusted accordingly 
since the fair market value of options granted to non employees is subject to change in the future  the amount of the future compensation expense is subject to adjustment until the common stock options or warrants are fully vested 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment on an annual basis  as of december  or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of such assets below their carrying values 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
if our estimates used in the determination of either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods are not accurate as compared to actual future results  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
net income loss per share basic net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
diluted net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding 
potentially dilutive stock options and warrants to purchase approximately million  million and million shares at december   and  respectively  were excluded from the computation of diluted net income loss per share  because the effect would be anti dilutive 
quarterly financial data the following table sets forth unaudited consolidated statements of operations data for each quarter during our most recent two fiscal years 
this quarterly information has been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods covered 
the quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
quarter ended march june september december in thousands  except per share data total revenues net income loss net income loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted loss per share applicable to common stock total revenues net loss net loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted loss per share applicable to common stock quarterly and yearly income loss per share amounts are computed independently of each other 
therefore  the sum of the per share amounts for the quarters may not equal the per share amounts for the year 
in and  we incurred million and million  respectively  in employee non cash compensation expenses 
the comparability of our quarterly financial data may be affected by the same events and items described under selected financial data above 
liquidity and capital resources general in order to fund our business and operations  we have relied primarily upon sales of our equity securities  sales of shares of common stock of our former rxi subsidiary and proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants 
we also have received limited funding from our strategic partners and licensees 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of million 
management believes that our current resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
the belief is based  in part  upon our currently projected expenditures for of approximately million  which includes approximately million for our clinical programs for aldoxorubicin  approximately million for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million for general operation of our clinical programs  and approximately million for other general and administrative expenses 
these projected expenditures are based upon numerous assumptions and subject to many uncertainties  and our actual expenditures may be significantly different from these projections 
we will ultimately be required to obtain additional funding in order to execute our long term business plans  although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital 
we cannot assure you that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional funding when needed  we may not be able to execute our business plans and our business may suffer  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if we obtain marketing approval as currently planned and successfully commercialize our product candidates  we anticipate it will take several years  and possibly longer  for us to generate significant recurring revenue  and we will be dependent on future financing until such time  if ever  as we can generate significant recurring revenue 
we have no commitments from third parties to provide us with any additional financing  and we may not be able to obtain future financing on favorable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain adequate financing would adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  dilution to stockholders may result and new investors could have rights superior to holders of the shares issued in this offering 
in addition  debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
if adequate funds are not available to us  we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets or to delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate some portion or all of our development programs or clinical trials 
we also may have to license to other companies our product candidates or technologies that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves 
discussion of operating  investing and financing activities net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash used for operating activities for that period was million 
the net loss for the year reflects million for stock option and warrant expense  and a non cash gain of million on the fair value adjustment of the warrant liability 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash used for operating activities for that period was million 
the net loss for the year reflects million for stock option and warrant expense and a non cash gain of million on the fair value adjustment of the warrant liability 
net profit for the year ended december  was million  and cash used for operating activities for that period was million 
the net profit for the year reflects gain of million from the sale of rxi shares  million for stock option and warrant expense and a non cash million fair value adjustment of the warrant liability 
for the year ended december   million was used for investing activities 
this included million net for the purchase of short term investments 
for the year ended december   million was provided by investing activities 
this included million of net proceeds from sales of short term investments and million received from the sale of rxi common shares 
for the year ended december   million was provided by investing activities 
this included million received from the sale of rxi common shares and million of net proceeds from sales of short term investments  partially offset by million used to purchase equipment and furnishings 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  which was attributable to the net proceeds received from our october public offering 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  which was attributable to the net proceeds received from our august public offering 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  which was attributable to proceeds from the exercise of previously outstanding stock options and warrants 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contractual obligations we acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required  contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by a regulatory agency 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
these arrangements may be material individually  and in the event that milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
in addition  these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
our current contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in thousands operating leases employment agreements subtotal research and development total total operating leases are primarily facility lease related obligations  as well as equipment and software lease obligations with third party vendors 
employment agreements include management contracts  which have been revised from time to time  provide for minimum salary levels  adjusted annually at the discretion of our compensation committee  as well as for minimum bonuses that are payable 
research and development obligations relate primarily to clinical trials 
most of these purchase obligations are cancelable upon notice without liabilities to us 
we apply the disclosure provisions of asc  guarantees asc  to our contractual guarantees and indemnities 
we have provided contractual indemnities to investors and other parties against possible losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties in connection with various types of third party claims  as well as indemnities to our officers and directors against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us 
to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these indemnities  and we do not expect to incur material costs in the future  further  we maintain insurance to cover certain losses arising from these indemnities 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements related to these indemnities 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset against future taxable income  which expire in through our utilization of net operating loss nol carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  as well as similar state provisions 
these provisions limit the amount of nol carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and income tax following an ownership change  defined by section of the code to mean a transaction or series of transactions over a three year period resulting in an ownership change of more than percentage points of the market value of a company by certain stockholders or public groups 
as a result of an ownership change that occurred in our shareholder base in july  approximately million in federal net operating loss carryforwards became limited in their availability to million in total or  annually 
management currently believes that the remaining million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  and the million in state net operating loss carryforwards  are unrestricted 
as of december   we also had research and development and alternative minimum tax credits for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available for offset against future income taxes  which expire in through based on an assessment of all available evidence including  but not limited to  our limited operating history in our core business and lack of profitability  uncertainties of the commercial viability of our technology  the impact of government regulation and healthcare reform initiatives  and other risks normally associated with biotechnology companies  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards and credits will not be realized and 
as a result  a deferred tax valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets 
results of operations we incurred a net profit loss of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  and  we recognized no service revenues and earned an immaterial amount of license fees and grant revenue 
all future licensing fees under our current licensing agreements are dependent upon successful development milestones being achieved by the licensor 
during  we are not anticipating the receipt of any significant service or licensing fees 
our net loss may increase from current levels primarily due to expenses related to our ongoing and planned clinical trials  research and development programs  possible technology acquisitions  and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate  therefore  that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
research and development years ended december  in thousands research and development expenses non cash research and development expenses employee stock option expense research expenses are expenses incurred by us in the discovery of new information that will assist us in the creation and the development of new drugs or treatments 
development expenses are expenses incurred by us in our efforts to commercialize the findings generated through our research efforts 
research and development expenses incurred during  and relate to our various development programs 
in  we initiated a phase b clinical trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate preliminary efficacy of aldoxorubicin administered in combination with doxorubicin in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed other therapies  we also initiated a phase trial for patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas while expanding the number of sites in our international phase b clinical trial with aldoxorubicin in patients with soft tissue sarcomas 
we continued our international phase b clinical trial with tamibarotene in patients with nsclc  however  our development work on bafetinib was suspended in  as our focus will be to partner any further development 
overall  this resulted in a decrease in research and development expenses over research and development expenses were higher in than in  due to the initiation in of clinical trials with aldoxorubicin and tamibarotene  and our preparations for the clinical trials that were initiated in in  our development costs included approximately million for our clinical programs for aldoxorubicin  approximately million for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million for our clinical programs for bafetinib and approximately million for general operation of our clinical programs 
none of our research and development costs have ever been capitalized 
as compensation to consultants  and in connection with the acquisition of technology  we sometimes issue shares of common stock  stock options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever is more reliably measurable 
we recorded no expense in  whereas for the and years  incurred a charge of million and million  respectively 
in  we recorded million of employee stock option expense  as compared to million in and million in in  we expect our research and development expenses to increase moderately as a result of our clinical programs with aldoxorubicin and tamibarotene 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses stock  stock option and warrant expenses to non employees and consultants employee stock option expense general and administrative expenses include all administrative salaries and general corporate expenses  including legal expenses associated with the prosecution of our intellectual property 
our general and administrative expenses  excluding common stock  stock options and warrants issued  were million in  million in and million in these expenses did not materially change from to the million reduction in expenses from as compared to was partially due to a reduction in executive bonuses of million  and a reduction in professional fees 
from time to time  we issue shares of our common stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock to consultants and other service providers in exchange for services 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever we can measure more reliably 
we recorded employee stock option expense of million in  million in and million in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses for each of the years ended december   and were approximately million 
the depreciation expense reflects the depreciation of our equipment and furnishings 
other income in  and  we recognized non cash gains of million  million and million  respectively  on the valuation of our warrant derivative liabilities related to warrants issued in august and july in  we recognized a gain of million on the sale of rxi shares 
interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the variances between years are attributable primarily to the amount of funds available for investment each year and  to a lesser extent  changes in prevailing market rates 
recent accounting pronouncements we have reviewed all of the recent accounting pronouncements and have determined that they have not or will not have a material impact on our financial statements  or simply do not apply to our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because a significant portion of our investments are in short term debt securities issued by the us government and institutional money market funds 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not exposed to any material market risk 
we do not have any speculative or hedging derivative financial instruments or foreign currency instruments 
if interest rates had varied by in the year ended december   it would not have had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows for that period
