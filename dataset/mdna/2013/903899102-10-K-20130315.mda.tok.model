the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the financial information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is presented in thousands of dollars  except for share and per share amounts 
all figures presented below represent results from continuing operations  unless otherwise specified 
general we offer products and services ranging from portable power solutions to communications and electronics systems 
through our engineering and collaborative approach to problem solving  we serve government  defense and commercial customers across the globe 
we design  manufacture  install and maintain power and communications systems including rechargeable and non rechargeable batteries  communications and electronics systems and accessories and custom engineered systems 
we sell our products worldwide through a variety of trade channels  including original equipment manufacturers oems  industrial and defense supply distributors and directly to us and international defense departments 
we report our results in two operating segments battery energy products and communications systems 
the battery energy products segment includes lithium volt  cylindrical and various other non rechargeable batteries  in addition to rechargeable batteries  uninterruptable power supplies  charging systems and accessories  such as cables 
the communications systems segment includes rf amplifiers  power supplies  cable and connector assemblies  amplified speakers  equipment mounts  case equipment  integrated communication system kits and communications and electronics systems design 
we believe that reporting performance at the gross profit level is the best indicator of segment performance 
as such we report segment performance at the gross profit level and operating expenses as corporate charges 
we continually evaluate ways to grow  including opportunities to expand through mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures  which can broaden the scope of our products and services  expand operating and market opportunities and provide the ability to enter new lines of business synergistic with our portfolio of offerings 
on march   we decided to exit our energy services business 
as a result of management s review of our business segments and products  and taking into account the lack of growth and profitability potential of the energy services segment as well as its sizeable operating losses  we determined it was appropriate to refocus our operations on profitable growth opportunities presented in our other segments  battery energy products and communications systems 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to write off the goodwill and intangible assets and certain fixed assets associated with the standby power portion of our energy services business 
the actions taken to exit our energy services business resulted in the elimination of approximately jobs and the closing of five facilities  primarily in california  florida and texas 
we completed all exit activities with respect to our energy services segment by the end of the second quarter of  and have reclassified our energy services segment as a discontinued operation 
in connection with the exit activities described above  we recorded total restructuring charges of approximately  in the restructuring charges include approximately of employee related costs  including termination benefits  approximately of lease termination costs  approximately of inventory and fixed asset write downs and approximately  of other associated costs 
the cash component of the aggregate total restructuring charges was approximately  subsequent to the completion of our exit activities  adjustments have been made to estimates of certain reserves and accruals that existed at that time 
these adjustments amount to and were due to the difference in our actual experience compared to our expectations as of the completion of our exit activities 
on february   we announced our intention to divest our redblack communications  inc redblack business in as a result of management s ongoing review of our business portfolio  management had determined that redblack offered limited opportunities to achieve the operating thresholds of our new business model 
on september   we entered into and closed a stock purchase agreement to sell of our capital stock in redblack to bcf solutions  inc the agreement 
in exchange for the sale of redblack  we received  as a purchase price  comprised of cash at closing in the amount of  funds held in escrow for up to one year in the amount of  as well as to be available for redblack employee retention programs 
in addition  there will be a customary post closing working capital adjustment to the purchase price 
the agreement contains customary representations and warranties that will survive for a period of two or three years 
the agreement also contains customary indemnification for breaches of the representations and warranties identified in the agreement 
pursuant to the agreement  we are prohibited from engaging or participating with any current customer of redblack in any business  directly or indirectly  that competes with the business conducted by redblack for two years 
we are also prohibited from hiring  soliciting  or recruiting any current employee  independent contractor  or consultant of bcf solutions  inc or redblack for two years 
commencing with the first quarter of  the results of the redblack operations and related divestiture costs have been reported as a discontinued operation 
certain items included within income from discontinued operations are based upon management s best estimates as of the date of sale and may change should our estimates be different from our actual experience 
during the fourth quarter of  management elected not to renew the lease for its uk manufacturing facility which expires on march   and to relocate its sales and services operations to a smaller facility 
as a result of this decision  ultralife is required to restore the facility back to its original condition per a previous contractual commitment 
the estimated costs associated with the restoration total approximately of which was recorded in fourth quarter of as general administrative expenses and has been recorded as discontinued operations 
in addition  we expect to realize net savings of approximately on an annualized basis beginning in the second quarter of in  we implemented a series of lean initiatives throughout our entire organization 
lean is a disciplined management philosophy which is focused on using resources more effectively and the elimination of non value added functions to any process 
the expected result is a reduction in costs and increased efficiency 
currently  we do not experience significant seasonal sales trends in any of our operating segments  although sales to the us defense department and other international defense organizations can be sporadic based on the needs of those particular customers 
overview consolidated revenues decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  this decrease was caused by declining revenues in our battery energy products segment in when compared to  as a result of lower government and defense sales  the completion of a long running telematics contract in that was not continued  and lower sales of rechargeable batteries to commercial customers  partially offset by the impact of the  non recurring charge related to the dcaa settlement during the first quarter of and increased shipments of watt amplifier sales in our communications systems segment 
gross margin increased to for the year ended december   as opposed to for the year ended december   due to favorable product mix  increased pricing for some of our products and lean manufacturing improvements  as well as  last year s non recurring  dcaa settlement charge and  charge to write off components associated with a discontinued amplifier line 
operating expenses decreased by  or to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december   reflecting continued lean initiatives  actions to reduce general and administrative expenses  as well as more focused spending on the development of new products  while investing a portion of our savings in the expansion of the sales force to increase our geographic coverage and penetrate new markets 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from reported in due to the impact of lower revenues in net loss from continuing operations was  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to net income of  or per share  for the year ended december  net loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  was  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss  net of tax of  or per share  for the year ended december  adjusted ebitda  defined as net income loss attributable to ultralife before net interest expense  provision benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  plus minus expenses income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing operations  amounted to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  see the section adjusted ebitda beginning on page for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss attributable to ultralife 
as a result of careful working capital management and cash generated from operations  our liquidity remains solid with cash of  a  improvement over the cash position of  as of december  the company had no debt as of december  our inventory levels decreased by  or  to  at the end of from  at the end of due to more focused inventory management and planning 
outlook for  management expects low to mid single digit organic revenue growth reflecting strong growth in communications systems sales and modest gains in the battery energy products business  despite continued constraints on us government spending 
based on this outlook for revenue growth  ongoing productivity improvements and plans to continue prudently investing in new product development  management expects to increase operating profitability for the year and to generate a mid single digit operating margin 
management cautions that the timing of orders and shipments may cause variability in quarterly results

total revenues for the twelve months ended december  amounted to  a decrease of  or from the  reported for the twelve months ended december  battery energy products revenues decreased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december  from the  reported for the twelve months ended december  as a result of lower government and defense sales  the completion of a long running telematics contract in  as well as lower sales of rechargeable batteries to commercial customers  partially offset by last year s  non recurring dcaa settlement charge 
the decline in government and defense sales and lower sales of rechargeable batteries was primarily caused by reductions in government spending that negatively impacted our entire industry 
communications systems revenues increased  or  from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december   as a result of the ongoing successful international business development efforts leading to increased shipments of watt amplifiers in our communications systems segment 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  consolidated cost of products sold as a percentage of total revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  correspondingly  consolidated gross margin was for the year ended december   compared with a gross margin of for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to favorable product mix  increased pricing for some of our products and lean manufacturing improvements  as well as  last year s  non recurring dcaa settlement charge and  charge to write off components associated with a discontinued amplifier line 
in our battery energy products segment  the cost of products sold decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  battery energy products gross margin for was  or  a decrease of  from s gross margin of  or 
battery energy products gross margin increased by basis points for the twelve month period ended december   primarily as a result of last year s non recurring dcaa settlement charge 
in our communications systems segment  the cost of products sold increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  communications systems gross margin for was  or  an increase of  from s gross margin of  or 
the year over year comparison was impacted by the  non cash charge recorded in the third quarter of to write off discontinued legacy amplifiers 
excluding this adjustment  the gross margin for would have been 
the slight decrease in gross margin after excluding the non cash amplifier charge from was attributable to sales mix  as well as  reduced volume pricing for certain large projects earlier in the year 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   reflecting continued lean initiatives  actions to reduce general and administrative expenses and focused spending in the development of new products while investing a portion of our savings in the expansion of the sales force to increase our geographic coverage and penetrate new markets 
overall  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from reported for the prior year  due to the impact of lower revenues in amortization expense associated with intangible assets related to our acquisitions was for in selling  general and administrative expenses and in research and development costs  compared with for in selling  general  and administrative expenses and in research and development costs 
research and development costs were  in  a decrease of  or  over the  reported in selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   reflecting on going actions to reduce general and administrative expenses  while investing a portion of our savings in the expansion of our sales force to increase our geographic coverage and penetrate new markets 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  interest expense  net of interest income  decreased  from during to during  as a result of lower average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities during the course of miscellaneous expense amounted to for compared with income of for  primarily due to transactions impacted by changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
income taxes 
we recorded a tax provision of for the year ended december  compared with a tax provision of for the same period of the expense is primarily due to a the income reported for our china operations during the periods  and b the recognition of deferred tax liabilities generated from goodwill and certain intangible assets that cannot be predicted to reverse for book purposes during our loss carryforward periods 
the effective consolidated tax rate for the years ended december  and was years ended december  income loss before incomes taxes a total income tax provision benefit b effective tax rate b a in and  in the us and the us  we continue to report a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets that cannot be offset by reversing temporary differences 
this results from the conclusion that it is more likely than not that we would not utilize our us and uk nol s that had accumulated over time 
the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets resulted from our evaluation of all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the assessment of the realizability of the nol s was based on a number of factors including  our history of net operating losses  the volatility of our earnings  our historical operating volatility  our historical inability to accurately forecast earnings for future periods and the continued uncertainty of the general business climate as of the end of we concluded that these factors represent sufficient negative evidence and have concluded that we should record a full valuation allowance under financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance on the accounting for income taxes 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have determined that a change in ownership  as defined under internal revenue code section  occurred in and as such  the domestic net operating loss nol carryforward will be subject to an annual limitation estimated to be in the range of approximately  to  the unused portion of the annual limitation can be carried forward to subsequent periods 
our ability to utilize nol carryforwards due to successive ownership changes is currently limited to a minimum of approximately  annually  plus the carryover from unused portions of the annual limitations 
we believe such limitation will not impact our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 
in addition  certain of our nol carryforwards are subject to us alternative minimum tax such that carryforwards can offset only of alternative minimum taxable income 
this limitation did not have an impact on income taxes determined for the second quarters of and the use of our uk nol carryforwards may be limited due to the change in the uk operation during from a manufacturing and assembly center to primarily a distribution and service center 
discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  totaled for the year ended december   compared to a loss of  in the same period of the charge is primarily due to restoration costs related to our decision to not renew the lease of our present uk manufacturing facility and to relocate our uk sales and services operations to a small facility 
discontinued operations for include the operating results of the redblack business  which was sold in the third quarter of  as well as  the costs associated with exiting the energy services business 
for more information  see note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
net loss attributable to ultralife 
net loss attributable to ultralife and net loss attributable to ultralife common shareholders per diluted share were  and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to net loss attributable to ultralife and net loss attributable to ultralife common shareholders per diluted share of  and  respectively  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the reasons described above 
average common shares outstanding used to compute diluted earnings per share increased from  in to  in  mainly due to stock option exercises and shares of common stock issued to our non employee directors 
adjusted ebitda from continuing operations in evaluating our business  we consider and use adjusted ebitda from continuing operations  a non gaap financial measure  as a supplemental measure of our operating performance 
we define adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as net income loss attributable to ultralife before net interest expense  provision benefit for income taxes  depreciation and amortization  plus minus expenses income that we do not consider reflective of our ongoing continuing operations 
we use adjusted ebitda from continuing operations as a supplemental measure to review and assess our operating performance and to enhance comparability between periods 
we also believe the use of adjusted ebitda from continuing operations facilitates investors use of operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in such items as capital structures affecting relative interest expense and stock based compensation expense  the book amortization of intangible assets affecting relative amortization expense  the age and book value of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense and other significant non operating expenses or income 
we also present adjusted ebitda from continuing operations because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance 
we reconcile adjusted ebitda from continuing operations to net income loss attributable to ultralife  the most comparable financial measure under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
we use adjusted ebitda from continuing operations in our decision making processes relating to the operation of our business together with us gaap financial measures such as income loss from operations 
we believe that adjusted ebitda from continuing operations permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our us gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization  which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance  and of non cash stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among companies 
we believe that by limiting adjusted ebitda to continuing operations  we assist investors in gaining a better understanding of our business on a going forward basis 
we provide information relating to our adjusted ebitda from continuing operations so that securities analysts  investors and other interested parties have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
we believe that trends in our adjusted ebitda from continuing operations are a valuable indicator of our operating performance on a consolidated basis and of our ability to produce operating cash flows to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
the term adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is not defined under us gaap  and is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with us gaap 
our adjusted ebitda from continuing operations has limitations as an analytical tool  and when assessing our operating performance  adjusted ebitda from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss attributable to ultralife or other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with us gaap 
some of these limitations include  but are not limited to  the following a 
adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  and all of the costs associated with operating our business  b 
although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda from continuing operations does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  c 
while stock based compensation is a component of cost of products sold and operating expenses  the impact on our consolidated financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as assumed life of the stock based awards and assumed volatility of our common stock  d 
although discontinued operations does not reflect our current business operations  discontinued operations includes the costs we incurred by exiting our energy services business and divesting our redblack communications business  and e 
other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda from continuing operations differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda from continuing operations only supplementally 
adjusted ebitda from continuing operations is calculated as follows for the periods presented years ended december  net loss attributable to ultralife add interest expense  net add income tax provision add depreciation add amortization of intangible assets add stock based compensation expense add loss from discontinued operations  net of tax adjusted ebitda liquidity and capital resources cash flows and general business matters the following cash flow information is being presented net of continuing and discontinued operations 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of  from the beginning of the year 
during the twelve months ended december   we generated  of cash from operating activities as compared to generating  of cash for the twelve months ended december  the generation of cash from operating activities was caused primarily to a decline in the cash generated by accounts receivable year over year offset by the generation of cash from the reductions in inventory 
the cash from operating activities provided in was mainly attributable to our net loss of  plus an add back of  for non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation and a loss from discontinued operations  net of tax of approximately of cash was generated from working capital due mainly to decreases in our inventory due to the continued focus on improving inventory management  a decrease in our insurance receivable relating to fires and a decrease in accounts receivable 
these cash generations were offset partially by a decrease in our accounts payable 
for  the cash generated from operating activities of  was mainly attributable to a net loss of  plus an add back of  for non cash expenses of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation and a loss from discontinued operations of  approximately  of cash was generated from working capital due mainly to a decrease in accounts receivable  offset by an increase in inventories and a decrease in accounts payable 
we used in cash for investing activities during compared with  in cash used for investing activities in in  we spent  to purchase plant  property  and equipment and increased our restricted cash by offsetting these outlays was a cash inflow for our divestiture of redblack communications of  in  we spent  to purchase plant  property and equipment and was used in connection with the contingent purchase price payout related to rps power systems  inc rps 
in addition  we received in cash proceeds from dispositions of property  plant and equipment and relating to the reduction of the uk restricted cash 
during  we received in funds from financing activities compared to the use of  in funds from financing activities in the financing activities in were solely due to the proceeds of the issuance of our common stock 
the financing activities in included outflows of  for repayments on the revolver portion of our primary credit facility  for principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations  relating to discontinued operations and an inflow of cash from stock option exercises of although we booked a full reserve for our deferred tax asset during the fourth quarter of and continued to carry this reserve as of december  and  we continue to have significant us nol s available to us to utilize as an offset to taxable income 
as of december   none of our us nol s have expired 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inventory turnover for the year ended december  averaged turns compared to turns for the decrease in this metric is due mainly to lower sales year over year offset slightly by a reduction in average inventory over that same period 
our order backlog at december  was approximately  lower than in prior years  mostly due to continued delays in government orders 
the majority of the backlog was related to orders that are expected to ship throughout and as of december   we had made commitments to purchase approximately of production machinery and equipment  which we expect to fund through operating cash flows or the use of debt 
debt and lease commitments on february   we entered into a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility credit facility of up to  which was subsequently reduced to  as described in greater detail below  with rbs business capital  a division of rbs asset finance  inc rbs 
the proceeds from the credit facility can be used for general working capital purposes  general corporate purposes  and letter of credit foreign exchange support 
the credit facility had a maturity date of february   that was subsequently extended to may   as discussed in greater detail below maturity date 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
at closing  we paid rbs a facility fee of on february   we drew down  from the credit facility to repay all outstanding amounts due under our previous credit facility with jp morgan chase bank  na and manufacturers and traders trust company 
our available borrowing under the credit facility fluctuates from time to time based upon the amounts of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory 
available borrowings under the credit facility  as amended  equals the lesser of  or of eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of a up to of the book value of our eligible inventory or b of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of our eligible inventory 
the borrowing base under the credit facility is further reduced by the face amount of any letters of credit outstanding  any liabilities of ours under hedging contracts with rbs and the value of any reserves as deemed appropriate by rbs 
we are required to have at least  available under the credit facility at all times 
on january   we entered in a first amendment to credit agreement first amendment with rbs 
the first amendment amended the credit facility as follows i eligible accounts receivable under the credit facility for the determination of available borrowings now include foreign non us accounts subject to credit insurance payable to rbs formerly  such accounts were not eligible without arranging letter of credit facilities satisfactory to rbs 
ii decreased the interest rate that will accrue on outstanding indebtedness  as set forth in the following table excess availability libor rate plus greater than  greater than  but less than or equal to  greater than  but less than or equal to  on september   we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility second amendment with rbs 
the second amendment amended the credit facility to consent to the sale of the stock of redblack and to release any and all liens on redblack 
on february   we entered into a third amendment to the credit facility third amendment with rbs 
the third amendment amended the credit facility to extend the maturity date from february  to may   reduced the maximum amount available under the credit facility to  and reduced the unused line fee to per year 
interest currently accrues on outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility at libor plus 
we have the ability  in certain circumstances  to fix the interest rate for up to days from the date of borrowing 
as of december   in addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the credit facility  we were required to pay an unused line fee of on the unused portion of the  credit facility 
as of the third amendment  we now pay an unused line fee of on the unused portion of the lowered  credit facility 
in both instances  we must also pay customary letter of credit fees equal to the libor rate and the applicable margin and any other customary fees or expenses of the issuing bank 
interest that accrues under the credit facility is to be paid monthly with all outstanding principal  interest and applicable fees due on the maturity date 
we are required to maintain a fixed charge ratio of to or greater at all times as of and after march  as of december   our fixed charge ratio was to 
accordingly  we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit facility 
all borrowings under the credit facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions  including the absence of an event of default and accuracy of our representations and warranties 
the credit facility also includes customary representations and warranties  affirmative covenants and events of default 
if an event of default occurs  rbs would be entitled to take various actions  including accelerating the amount due under the credit facility  and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor 
as of december   we had outstanding under the credit facility 
at december   the interest rate on the asset based revolver component of the credit facility was 
as of december   the revolver arrangement had approximately  of borrowing capacity  including outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we had of outstanding letters of credit related to this facility 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other matters our credit facility  including the recently enacted extension  expires in may of we are currently seeking to enter into a new credit facility with rbs or another lender that will become effective when the credit facility matures 
we anticipate seeking a new credit facility with availability comparable to our current credit facility  but on terms reflecting our improved liquidity position 
while we can provide no assurances that we will be able to execute a new credit agreement on terms acceptable to us or at all  we believe that that we will be able to enter into a new credit agreement on favorable terms due primarily to our improved liquidity position 
with respect to our battery products  we typically offer warranties against any defects due to product malfunction or workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase 
with respect to our communications accessory products  we typically offer a three year warranty 
previously  we had offered up to a four year warranty 
we provide for a reserve for these potential warranty expenses  which is based on an analysis of historical warranty issues 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates and assumptions that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are described below 
revenue recognition product sales in general  revenues from the sale of products are recognized when products are shipped 
when products are shipped with terms that require transfer of title upon delivery at a customer s location  revenues are recognized on date of delivery 
a provision is made at the time the revenue is recognized for warranty costs expected to be incurred 
customers  including distributors  do not have a general right of return on products shipped 
technology contracts we recognize revenue using the proportional method  measured by the percentage of actual costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the contract 
elements of cost include direct material  labor and overhead 
if a loss on a contract is estimated  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
we allocate costs to all technology contracts based upon actual costs incurred including an allocation of certain research and development costs incurred 
deferred revenue for each source of revenues  we defer recognition if i evidence of an agreement does not exist  ii delivery or service has not occurred  iii the selling price is not fixed or determinable  or iv collectability is not reasonably assured 
valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
our inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
we record provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand  technology developments or other economic factors 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are our purchasing practices  material and product obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials see item a risk factors for further information on foreign regulations 
we manage our exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
warranties we maintain provisions related to normal warranty claims by customers 
we evaluate these reserves quarterly based on actual experience with warranty claims to date and our assessment of additional claims in the future 
there is no assurance that future warranty claims will be consistent with past history  and in the event we experience a significant increase in warranty claims  there is no assurance that our reserves would be sufficient 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly assess all of our long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment 
should aggregate future cash flows be less than the carrying value  a write down would be required  measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated either through the assistance of an independent valuation or as the present value of expected discounted future cash flows 
the discount rate used by us in our evaluation approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment  no impairment is recognized 
environmental issues environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate  in accordance with fasb s guidance on environmental remediation liabilities 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the revised fasb guidance for business combinations  the purchase price paid to effect an acquisition is allocated to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at fair value 
in accordance with fasb s guidance for the accounting of goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that impairment exists 
we amortize intangible assets that have definite lives so that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized over their weighted average estimated useful life 
the impairment analysis of goodwill consists first of a review of various qualitative factors of the identified reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  including goodwill 
this review includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of the macroeconomic  industry or market  and cost factors relevant to the reporting unit as well as financial performance and entity or reporting unit events that may affect the value of the reporting unit 
if this review leads to the determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  further impairment testing is not required 
however  if this review cannot support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  or at our discretion  quantitative impairment steps are performed 
similarly  the analysis for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of review of various qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is not impaired 
if a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived asset is nor impaired cannot be supported  or at our discretion  quantitative impairment steps are performed 
the quantitative impairment test for goodwill consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit to which it is assigned 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets with their carrying amounts 
if the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on a discounted cash flow model 
we determine the fair value of our intangibles assets with indefinite lives trademarks through the royalty relief income valuation approach 
we conduct our annual impairment analysis for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in october of each fiscal year 
for  we have identified three goodwill reporting units for analysis 
we performed a qualitative analysis for two reporting units and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its respective carrying amount 
we performed a quantitative analysis on our communications systems reporting unit as of september  as we determined that a triggering event  as defined within relevant accounting guidance  occurred in the third quarter as a result of the decrease in our market valuation in relation to our shareholder s equity 
this testing indicated no impairment 
for  we identified four trademarks for analysis 
we performed a qualitative analysis for two trademarks and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of each trademark was greater than its respective carrying amount 
we performed an early impairment test on the two trademarks associate with communications systems in conjunction with the goodwill testing referenced above 
no impairment of either trademark tested was indicated 
however  due to the narrow margin of passing the testing in  there is potential that the mcdowell communications systems trademark may become partially or fully impaired in if the projected revenue targets are not met 
as of december   the mcdowell communications systems trademark had a carrying value of  stock based compensation we follow the provisions of fasb s guidance on share based payments  which requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
we calculate expected volatility for stock options by taking an average of historical volatility over the past five years and a computation of implied volatility 
the computation of expected term was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards and vesting schedules 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
income taxes we apply fasb s guidance in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that may be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
in and  in the us and the us  we continued to report a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets that cannot be offset by reversing temporary differences 
this results from the conclusion that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize our us and us nol s that had accumulated over time 
the recognition of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets resulted from our evaluation of all available evidence  both positive and negative 
the assessment of the realizability of the nol s was based on a number of factors including  our history of net operating losses  the volatility of our earnings  our historical operating volatility  our historical inability to accurately forecast earnings for future periods and the continued uncertainty of the general business climate as of the end of we concluded that these factors represent sufficient negative evidence and have concluded that we should record a full valuation allowance under fasb s guidance on the accounting for income taxes 
we currently carry a deferred tax asset in china that we have determined does not require a valuation allowance as we are more likely than not to fully utilize the nol in china 
we continually assess the carrying value of this asset based on relevant accounting standards
