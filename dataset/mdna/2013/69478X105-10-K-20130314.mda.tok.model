item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary our principal business is attracting deposits from small and middle market businesses and consumers and investing those deposits together with funds generated from operations and borrowings  primarily in commercial business loans and various types of commercial real estate loans 
in  the company expects to fund substantially all of the loans that it originates or purchases through deposits  fhlb advances and internally generated funds 
deposit flows and cost of funds are influenced by prevailing market rates of interest primarily on competing investments  account maturities and the levels of savings in the company s market area 
the company generates the majority of its revenues from interest income on loans that it originates and purchases  income from investment in securities and service charges on customer accounts 
the company s revenues are partially offset by interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings  the provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses  such as operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses primarily consist of employee compensation and benefits  premises and occupancy expenses  and other general expenses 
the company results of operations are also affected by prevailing economic conditions  competition  government policies and other actions of regulatory agencies 
recent developments pending acquisitions 
in connection with executing our strategic growth plans  we currently have two pending acquisition transactions 
on march   we announced entering into a definitive agreement to acquire sdtb  which is headquartered in san diego  california 
at december   sdtb had total assets of million and total deposits of at the time that the definitive merger agreement was entered into  the acquisition of sdtb was valued at approximately million 
the acquisition of sdtb is expected to close late in the second quarter of or in the third quarter of  subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including regulatory approvals and approval of sdtb s shareholders 
on october   we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire fab 
fab is exclusively focused on providing deposit and other services to hoas and hoa management companies nationwide 
fab operates out of its headquarters in dallas  texas 
at december   fab had total assets of million  total deposits of million and total stockholders equity of million 
at the time that the definitive merger agreement was entered into  the acquisition of fab was valued at approximately million  which includes approximately million in deal consideration for fab shareholders and million in cash consideration for fab option holders and warrant holders 
pacific premier anticipates that the closing of the acquisition of fab will occur in march  subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions  as provided in the definitive agreement 
fab is held a special meeting of its shareholders on march  and approved the transaction 
other than the costs we have incurred in in connection with the acquisition of fab  our financial statements for the periods reported do not reflect the impact of these potential acquisitions 
we  however  do expect that if the fab acquisition and or the sdtb acquisition is consummated that it will result in significant growth and positively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations in the future 
recently completed public offering 
on december   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  and on january   we issued an additional  shares of our common stock at the same price per share in connection with the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option granted to them as part of the offering 
for further information about our recently completed public offering  see financial condition below in this item critical accounting policies and estimates we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of the company s financial statements in item hereof 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions management uses are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at balance sheet dates and the company s results of operations for future reporting periods 
we consider the determination of alll and the determination of the otti of investment securities to be among our critical accounting policies that require judicious estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the company s financial statements that is particularly susceptible to significant change 
for further information on the alll  see business allowances for loan losses and note to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof 
for further information on otti of investment securities  see business investment activities and note to the consolidated financial statements in item hereof 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an alll at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known or inherent risks in the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the company has implemented and adheres to an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for the detection of problem assets and an adequate allowance to cover loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of alll is based on an evaluation of the composition of the portfolio  actual loss experience  industry charge off experience on income property loans  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors in the area in which the company s lending and real estate activities are based 
these factors may affect the borrowers ability to pay and the value of the underlying collateral 
the allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to loans held for investment according to loan program type and loan classification 
the loss factors are established based primarily upon the bank s historical loss experience and the industry charge off experience and are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s alll 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance based on judgments different from those of management 
in the opinion of management  and in accordance with the credit loss allowance methodology  the present allowance is considered adequate to absorb estimable and probable credit losses 
additions and reductions to the allowance are reflected in current operations 
charge offs to the allowance are made when specific assets are considered uncollectible or are transferred to oreo and the fair value of the property is less than the loan s recorded investment 
recoveries are credited to the allowance 
although management uses the best information available to make these estimates  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
we account for acquisitions under the purchase accounting method 
all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value 
we review each loan or loan pool acquired to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration in credit quality since inception and if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual loan agreements 
we consider expected prepayments and estimated cash flows including principal and interest payments at the date of acquisition 
the amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows is not accreted into earnings 
the amount in excess of the estimated future cash flows over the book value of the loan is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan accretable yield 
the company records these loans on the acquisition date at their net realizable value 
thus  an allowance for estimated future losses is not established on the acquisition date 
we refine our estimates of the fair value of loans acquired for up to one year from the date of acquisition 
subsequent to the date of acquisition  we update the expected future cash flows on loans acquired 
losses or a reduction in cash flow which arise subsequent to the date of acquisition are reflected as a charge through the provision for loan losses 
an increase in the expected cash flows adjusts the level of the accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the remaining life of the loan 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities the company has investment securities classified available for sale 
under the available for sale classification  securities can be sold in response to certain conditions  such as changes in interest rates  fluctuations in deposit levels or loan demand or need to restructure the portfolio to better match the maturity of interest rate characteristics of liabilities with assets 
securities classified as available for sale are accounted for at their current fair value 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of tax  are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
at each reporting date  investment securities available for sale are assessed to determine whether there is otti 
if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due from the contractual terms of a debt security  otti is charged to operations with a corresponding write down to the fair value of the security 
these related write downs are included in operations as realized losses in the category of otti loss on investment securities  net 
in estimating otti losses  management considers i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in a security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and iv general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole  including interest rates and sector credit spreads

net interest income 
our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities net interest rate spread and the relative dollar amount of these assets and liabilities principally affects our net interest income 
net interest income totaled million in  up million or from  reflecting a higher net interest margin and a million or increase in average interest earning assets 
the increase in average interest earning assets was primarily related to newly originated loans  purchased loans and loans acquired in the palm desert national acquisition 
compared to  our net interest margin increased basis points to in  primarily as a result of a decrease in the costs on interest bearing liabilities of basis points to which more than offset the decrease in the interest earning asset yield of basis points to 
the decline in our interest earning asset yield in was primarily from a lower yield on loans of basis points  partially offset by an improved mix of higher yielding loans within interest earning assets 
the reduction in deposit costs is primarily associated with our acquisition of palm desert national bank  which added million in deposits at a weighted average cost of basis points as of the closing of the transaction on april   excluding the runoff of million in wholesale certificates of deposit in the month subsequent to the acquisition 
net interest income totaled million in  up million or from  reflecting a higher net interest margin and a million or increase in average interest earning assets 
the increase in average interest earning assets resulted primarily from the canyon national acquisition  which added million in interest earning assets 
the net interest margin was in  up basis points from compared to  the increase in our net interest margin resulted from a decrease in the average costs on interest bearing liabilities of basis points to and an increase in the yield on interest earning assets of basis points to 
for  the decrease in costs on our interest bearing liabilities was mainly associated with a decline in our cost of deposits of basis points from to  primarily as a result of the deposits acquired from canyon national  which changed our deposit composition to have a higher mix of lower cost transaction accounts 
in addition  our cost of borrowings declined by basis points in  due to the pay down of higher cost borrowings as a result of the liquidity received in the canyon national acquisition 
the increase in yield on our interest earning assets was mainly associated with a greater proportion of higher yielding loans to lower yielding investment securities in  compared with such proportion in the following table presents for the periods indicated the average dollar amounts from selected balance sheet categories calculated from daily average balances and the total dollar amount  including adjustments to yields and costs  of interest income earned from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and interest expense incurred from average interest bearing liabilities and resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  net interest rate spread and net interest rate margin for the periods indicated 
the net interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate margin reflects the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and equals our net interest rate spread divided by average interest earning assets for the year

changes in our net interest income are a function of changes in both volumes and rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table presents the impact the volume and rate changes have had on our net interest income for the years indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  we have provided information on changes to our net interest income with respect to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes in interest rates changes in interest rates multiplied by prior volume  and the change or the combined impact of volume and rate changes allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in interest rates

the sluggish economic recovery in the markets in which we lend continue to adversely affect our borrowers and their businesses and  consequently  the collateral securing our loans 
these same economic conditions play a significant part in determining the amount to provision for an adequate level of alll at december  the company recorded a million provision for loan losses for  compared with a million provision recorded in net loan charge offs amounted to million in  up million from million experienced during the loan charge offs for primarily consisted of million of purchased loans and  of purchased credit impaired loans acquired in the canyon national acquisition 
noninterest income loss 
for  our noninterest income totaled million  compared with million in the increase of million was primarily due to net gains of  from the sale of million of loans in  compared to losses of million on the sale of million loans in  a larger bargain purchase pre tax gain on acquisitions from the fdic of million and an improvement in other than temporary impairment loss on investment securities of  for  our noninterest income totaled million  compared with noninterest loss of million in the favorable change of million reflected a bargain purchase gain of million on the canyon national acquisition and increases in deposit fee income of million  loan servicing fee income of  other income of  gain on the sale of investment securities available for sale of  and an improvement in other than temporary impairment loss on investment securities of  partially offset by an increase in loss on the sale of loans of  increases in deposit fee  servicing fee and other income categories in were primarily related to the canyon national acquisition 
noninterest expense 
for  noninterest expense totaled million  up million or from the increase was primarily related to a million increase in compensation and benefits costs as a result of increased head count and termination costs from the palm desert national acquisition and an expansion of our lending area to increase loan production  an increase in data processing and communication costs of  primarily from running two core systems and system conversion costs associated with the palm desert national acquisition  an increase in legal and audit costs of  and an increase in premises and occupancy costs of  partially offset by a decrease in marketing expense of  of the total noninterest expense recorded during  there were one time costs of  relating to the palm desert national acquisition and legal and audit expense of  relating to the pending acquisition of first associations bank fab 
for  noninterest expense totaled million  up million or from with the exception of our fdic insurance premiums  all expense categories increased in as compared to and included increases in compensation and benefits costs of million  primarily from an increase in employee count and termination costs  other expenses of  premises and occupancy expense of  data processing and communications expense of  and marketing expense of  these expense increases almost entirely related to the canyon national acquisition and were partially offset by lower fdic insurance premiums of  primarily due to the improvement in our assessment rate during the third quarter of income taxes 
the company recorded income taxes of million in  compared with million in and million in our effective tax rate was for  and for and for the effective tax rate in each year is affected by various items  including enterprise zone net interest deductions  interest expense related to payments of prior year taxes  and adjustments to income tax reserves related to management s favorable assessment of our income tax exposure 
the net impact of these items were expense reductions of  in   in and  in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item hereof for further discussion of income taxes and an explanation of the factors which impact our effective tax rate 
financial condition as a result of the palm desert national acquisition  the bank acquired and received certain assets with a fair value of approximately million  including million of loans  million of cash and cash equivalents  million of oreo  million in investment securities  including fhlb and federal reserve bank stock   of a core deposit intangibles  and million of other types of assets 
also as a result of the palm desert national acquisition  the bank assumed and recorded at acquisition date certain liabilities with a fair value of approximately million  including million in deposit transaction accounts  million in retail certificates of deposit  million in whole sale certificates of deposits  which were purposefully run off during the second quarter of  million in deferred tax liability and  of other type of liabilities 
at december   total assets of the company were billion  up million or from total assets of million at december  the increase was primarily due to increases in loans held for investment of million  partially offset by a decrease in investment securities of million 
the increase in loans held for investment since year end was predominately related to an increase in warehouse repurchase facility loans of million and the palm desert national acquisition  which added million in loans 
at december   total liabilities of the company were billion  compared with million at december  the million  or  increase during was due to increases in deposits of million to million and in fhlb advances and other borrowings of million to million 
the increase in deposits included million in non wholesale deposits associated with the palm desert national acquisition 
at december   our stockholders equity amounted to million  compared with million at december  the increase of million or in stockholders equity is primarily due to net income in of million and million in additional paid in capital  primarily from the corporation s recently completed public offering of common stock 
on december   the corporation completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions was million 
during december of  the corporation injected million of the proceeds from the offering into the bank  which enhanced the bank s regulatory capital 
on january   the corporation issued an additional  shares of its common stock at a public offering price of per share in connection with the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option granted to them as part of the offering 
the net proceeds from the over allotment after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions was million 
liquidity our primary sources of funds are principal and interest payments on loans  deposits  fhlb advances and other borrowings 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we seek to maintain a level of liquid assets to ensure a safe and sound operation 
our liquid assets are comprised of cash and unpledged investments 
as part of our daily monitoring  we calculate a liquidity ratio by dividing the sum of cash balances plus unpledged securities by the sum of deposits that mature in one year or less plus transaction accounts and fhlb advances 
at december   our liquidity ratio was  compared with at december  and at december  the reduction in the liquidity ratio at december  compared to december  is primarily related to the palm desert national acquisition whereby we added million in deposits and as we repositioned investments in securities into loans during we believe our level of liquid assets is sufficient to meet current anticipated funding needs 
at december   liquid assets of the company represented approximately of total assets  compared to at december  and at december  at december   the company had seven unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks to purchase federal funds totaling million  one reverse repo line with a correspondent bank of million and access through the federal reserve bank discount window to borrow million  as business needs dictate 
we also have a line of credit with the fhlb allowing us to borrow up to of the bank s total assets 
at december   we had a borrowing capacity of million  based on collateral pledged at the fhlb  with million outstanding in overnight borrowing 
the fhlb advance line is collateralized by eligible loan collateral and fhlb stock 
at december   we had approximately million of loans pledged to secure fhlb borrowings 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to originate or purchase loans for million  compared with  at december  at december   the company s loan to deposit and borrowing ratio was  compared with at december  the increase in the ratio from year end to was primarily associated with an increase in loans that more than offset the increase in deposit and borrowing balances 
certificates of deposit  which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled million 
we expect to retain a substantial portion of the maturing certificates of deposit at maturity 
the company has a policy in place that permits the purchase of brokered funds  in an amount not to exceed of total deposits  as a secondary source for funding 
at december  and  the company had no brokered time deposits 
the corporation is a company separate and apart from the bank that must provide for its own liquidity 
the corporation s primary sources of liquidity are dividends from the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation 
management believes that such restrictions will not have a material impact on the ability of the corporation to meet its ongoing cash obligations 
the financial code provides that a bank may not make a cash distribution to its stockholders in excess of the lesser of a i bank s retained earnings  or ii bank s net income for its last three fiscal years  less the amount of any distributions made by the bank or by any majority owned subsidiary of the bank to the stockholders of the bank during such period 
however  a bank may  with the approval of the dfi  make a distribution to its stockholders in an amount not exceeding the greatest of x its retained earnings  y its net income for its last fiscal year  or z its net income for its current fiscal year 
in the event that the dfi determines that the stockholders equity of a bank is inadequate or that the making of a distribution by the bank would be unsafe or unsound  the dfi may order the bank to refrain from making a proposed distribution 
under these provisions  the amount available for distribution from the bank to the corporation was approximately million at december  capital resources the corporation and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
at december   the bank s leverage capital amounted to million and risk based capital amounted to million 
at december   the bank s leverage capital was million and risk based capital was million 
pursuant to regulatory guidelines under prompt corrective action rules  a bank must have total risk based capital of or greater  tier risk based capital of or greater and tier i capital to adjusted tangible assets of or greater to be considered well capitalized 
at december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was  tier risk based capital ratio was and tier i to adjusted tangible assets capital ratio was

impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollar amounts except with respect to securities classified as available for sale which are carried at market value without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same magnitude as the price of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss or reduced earnings from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk in our lending and deposit taking activities 
interest rate risk primarily occurs to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis and frequency than our interest earning assets 
since our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  our principal objectives are to actively monitor and manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on net interest income 
in addition to the interest rate risk associated with our lending for investment and deposit taking activities  we also have market risk associated with loans held for sale 
changes in interest rates  primarily fixed rate loans  impact the fair value of loans held for sale 
rising interest rates typically result in a decrease in loan market value while declining interest rates typically result in an increase in loan market value 
our asset liability committee is responsible for implementing the bank s interest rate risk management policy which sets forth limits established by the board of directors of acceptable changes in net interest income and economic value of equity eve from specified changes in interest rates 
our asset liability committee reviews  among other items  economic conditions  the interest rate outlook  the demand for loans  the availability of deposits and borrowings  and our current operating results  liquidity  capital and interest rate exposure 
based on these reviews  our asset liability committee formulates a strategy that is intended to implement the objectives set forth in our business plan without exceeding the net interest income and eve limits set forth in our guidelines approved by our board of directors 
interest rate risk management 
the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determine the level of appropriate risk and manage the risk consistent with prudent asset and liability concentration guidelines approved by our board of directors 
we monitor asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and review various simulations and other analyses to determine the potential impact of various business strategies in controlling the company s interest rate risk and the potential impact of those strategies upon future earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
our primary strategy in managing interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination for investment of adjustable rate loans or loans with relatively short maturities 
interest rates on adjustable rate loans are primarily tied to month or month libor index  month moving average of yields on actively traded us treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year mta index and the wall street journal prime rate prime index 
also as part of this strategy  we seek to lengthen our deposit maturities when deposit rates are considered in the lower end of the interest rate cycle and shorten our deposit maturities when deposit rates are considered in the higher end of the interest rate cycle 
management monitors its interest rate risk as such risk relates to its operational strategies 
the company s board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the bank s capital in various interest rate scenarios 
the extent of the movement of interest rates  higher or lower  is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of the company 
if interest rates rise we may be subject to interest rate spread compression  which would adversely impact our net interest income 
this is primarily due to the lag in repricing of the indices  to which our adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are tied  as well as the repricing frequencies and interest rate caps and floors on these adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities 
the extent of the interest rate spread compression depends  among other things  upon the frequency and severity of such interest rate fluctuations 
economic value of equity 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model that estimates the change in the company s eve under alternative interest rate scenarios  primarily non parallel interest rate shifts over a twelve month period  basis point increments 
the model computes the net present value of capital by discounting all expected cash flows from assets  liabilities under each rate scenario 
first  we estimate our net interest income for the next twelve months and the current eve assuming no change in interest rates from those at period end 
once this base case has been estimated  we make calculations for each of the defined changes in interest rates and include any anticipated differences in the prepayment speeds of loans 
we then compare those results against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income and eve due to the changes in interest rates 
an eve ratio is defined as the eve divided by the market value of assets within the same scenario 
the sensitivity measure is the largest decline in the eve ratio  measured in basis points  caused by an increase or decrease in rates  and the higher an institution s sensitivity measure  the greater exposure it has to interest rate risk 
the following table shows the eve and projected change in the eve of the company at december   assuming non parallel interest rate shifts over a twelve month period of   and basis points bp as of december  dollars in thousands eve as of portfolio economic value of equity value of assets change in rates amount change change eve ratio change bp bp bp bp bp bp bp static bp bp bp bp bp bp it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitor behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve  customer behavior and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the company s eve 
although the eve measurement provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the company s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
selected assets and liabilities which are interest rate sensitive 
the following table provides information regarding the company s primary categories of assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates for the year ended december  the information presented reflects the expected cash flows of the primary categories by year  including the related weighted average interest rate 
the cash flows for loans are based on maturity and re pricing date 
the loans and mbss that have adjustable rate features are presented in accordance with their next interest repricing date 
cash flow information on interest bearing liabilities  such as passbooks  now accounts and money market accounts is also adjusted for expected decay rates  which are based on historical information 
in addition  for purposes of cash flow presentation  premiums or discounts on purchased assets and mark to market adjustments are excluded from the amounts presented 
all certificates of deposit and borrowings are presented by maturity date 
the weighted average interest rates for the various assets and liabilities presented are based on the actual rates that existed at december  the degree of market risk inherent in loans with prepayment features may not be completely reflected in the disclosures 
although we have taken into consideration historical prepayment trends adjusted for current market conditions to determine expected maturity categories  changes in prepayment behavior can be triggered by changes in many variables  including market rates of interest 
unexpected changes in these variables may increase or decrease the rate of prepayments from those anticipated 
as such  the potential loss from such market rate changes may be significantly larger
