the company s customers include the united states us department of defense dod  including the us army  navy  marines and air force  and its prime contractors  us government intelligence agencies  national aeronautics and space administration nasa  federal aviation administration faa  allied foreign governments and domestic and foreign commercial customers 
as a prime contractor  subcontractor  or preferred supplier  exelis participates in many high priority defense and non defense programs in the united states 
exelis conducts most of its business with the us government  principally the dod 
exelis inc was incorporated in indiana on may  our business is reported in two segments command  control  communications  computing  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr electronics and systems  and information and technical services 
our cisr electronics and systems segment provides engineered electronic systems and equipment  including force protection  electronic warfare systems  reconnaissance and surveillance systems  and integrated structures 
our information and technical services segment is a provider of logistics  infrastructure  and sustainment support  while also providing a diverse set of technical services 
separation from itt corporation on january   itt corporation itt announced a plan to separate its defense and information solutions exelis segment from the remainder of its businesses through a pro rata distribution of common stock of an entity holding the assets and liabilities associated with the defense and information solutions segment 
we were incorporated in indiana on may  to be the entity to hold such businesses 
the spin off from itt was completed on october  the distribution date  and exelis became an independent publicly traded company 
in connection with the spin off  the common stock of exelis was distributed  on a pro rata basis  to itt s shareholders of record as of the close of business on october  the record date 
on the distribution date  each of the shareholders of itt received one share of exelis common stock for every one share of common stock of itt held on the record date 
on october   itt also completed its spin off of page 
table of contents xylem inc  which includes itt s water related businesses 
the spin off was completed pursuant to the distribution agreement  dated as of october   among itt  exelis and xylem inc after the distribution date  itt did not beneficially own any shares of exelis common stock 
prior to the spin off  we were a business segment of itt corporation 
the financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future or what our financial position  result of operations and cash flows would have been had we been an independent  publicly traded company during the periods presented prior to october  we have been incurring additional costs necessary to operate as an independent  publicly traded company  including additional costs related to corporate finance  governance and public reporting 
we have funded these costs through cash on hand and cash from operations  and we believe cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these additional costs going forward 
we believe that the spin off has allowed us  and will continue to allow us  to improve strategic planning  increase management focus and streamline decision making by providing us the flexibility to implement our unique strategic plans and to respond more effectively to our customer needs and the changing economic environment 
known trends and uncertainties economic opportunities  challenges  and risks the united states continues to face significant economic and fiscal challenges  including slow gdp growth  high unemployment  and persistent us federal government budget deficits 
concerns over fiscal deficits and the national debt continue to drive the political debate and no national consensus exists on the appropriate level of defense and other federal spending  making longer term funding targets and priorities unclear 
this fiscal uncertainty has not abated following the us presidential election in november  and significant ambiguity persists as congress and the presidential administration negotiate actions to address budget deficits and overall federal spending 
we believe the prospects for finalizing fiscal year spending levels remain low because congress has failed to pass either a fiscal year budget resolution or the individual appropriations bills that serve to allocate discretionary spending among the federal government s cabinet agencies  commissions  boards and independent agencies 
for the near term  congress has enacted a six month continuing resolution cr  which will keep the government operating through march  the cr assumes a top line discretionary spending amount of trillion for fiscal year  consistent with the comprehensive budget agreement cba of august  which translates into an expected spending level of billion for the dod  down from billion in fiscal year  driven in large part by declining overseas contingency operation oco funding of billion  down from about billion in fiscal year the cba also includes a provision known as sequestration  scheduled to be implemented in march  which would impose significantly greater cuts to dod budgets over the next ten years  unless a compromise solution to reduce budget deficits is reached by congress and the president 
if sequestration were implemented it would significantly reduce most defense and domestic discretionary spending by fixed percentages of approximately and  respectively 
although the precise outcome is unclear  we expect increased uncertainty and lower top line dod spending over the next several years 
cuts could significantly reduce spending on procurement and research and development  accelerate reductions in force structure  and drive further savings in operations and maintenance and overhead spending 
page 
table of contents we believe potential solutions to this budgetary uncertainty include the following a yearlong cr with no enacted fiscal year appropriations bills or budget resolutions  a short term one year spending reduction bill which temporarily delays the first year of sequestration  or a comprehensive multi year budget agreement which combines spending cuts  tax reform  and entitlement or mandatory spending formula changes 
companies which derive substantial revenues from federal contracting will benefit the most from a comprehensive agreement which implements fundamental multi year changes that would prevent sequestration from actually occurring 
the debate over how and when a solution may be reached over the as yet unresolved sequestration issue remains a significant issue for the defense industry 
in its last strategic guidance  the dod emphasized a shift to a leaner force that is agile  flexible and technologically advanced 
this shift in force structure focuses on addressing a range of continuously evolving threats including terrorism  state aggression  weapons of mass destruction and cyberspace related aggression 
geographically  the dod recognizes the growing importance of the pacific rim regarding us economic and security interests 
as a result  the dod is emphasizing the intent to build upon its asia pacific presence while maintaining commitments in the middle east and europe  and at the same time increasing reliance on allied partnerships 
we believe ongoing instability in the middle east will result in continued us involvement in the region however  making a full and complete pivot to asia pacific less attainable 
we believe our portfolio of defense solutions  which covers a broad range of differentiated products and services  aligns well with the priorities outlined in the dod s guidance 
however  uncertainty related to potential changes in final appropriations and strategic priorities could materially impact our business 
programs related specifically to the support of ongoing operations in afghanistan are subject to changes in the level of us commitment 
the current presidential administration has stated its intent to withdraw all major forces by and maintain a limited presence after the subsequent transition to the afghan government 
the dod is focused on several initiatives to improve efficiency  refocus priorities  and enhance dod business practices 
as part of these initiatives  the dod is re evaluating the way capabilities are procured and continues to experiment with novel approaches 
this acquisition reform could increase competitive pressures and impact defense industry sales levels and profit margins going forward 
we believe  however  that we are well positioned for this environment by offering affordable and ready now solutions  which may realize true cost savings for the dod 
it is expected that as large scale ground deployments continue to decline  less emphasis will be placed on capabilities required for us soldiers soldier systems  including counter ied jammers  night vision equipment and tactical communications systems 
these expectations are reflected in our business plans 
while it is evident that reductions in demand for soldier systems will occur  the specific end state remains uncertain 
we believe that spending on recapitalization  modernization and maintenance of defense and security assets will continue despite possible reductions to some defense programs in which we participate or for which we expect to compete 
we expect ongoing dod emphasis to be placed on our areas of strength  such as electronic warfare  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance isr  imagery payloads  precision navigation instruments  cyber solutions  and information processing  exploitation and dissemination 
page 
table of contents although the federal government faces budget pressures and constraints for the foreseeable future  we believe that we are well positioned in areas of persistent demand in certain civil agencies  including our development and operation of the faa s ads b system  and management and operation of nasa s space communications networks 
globally  continued fiscal pressures in overseas economies could impact our business in markets such as the united kingdom and continental europe 
however  we are forecasting continued market growth in the middle east and asia pacific regions with new opportunities to expand our international business 
the information provided above represents a list of known trends and uncertainties that could impact our business in the foreseeable future 
it should  however  be considered along with the risk factors identified under the caption risk factors and the discussion under the section cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
executive summary exelis reported revenue of billion for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately compared to the decrease in revenue was driven by revenue declines of within our cisr electronics and systems segment primarily due to lower demand for surge related products  including our night vision and single channel ground and airborne radio systems sincgars products

impact to operating income from defined benefit plan expense we recorded net periodic benefit costs of in  compared to in in  prior to the spin off  we also received intercompany expense allocations from itt for defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement defined benefit plan costs of total defined benefit plan costs  including both net periodic benefit costs and the allocations from itt  decreased in as compared to this decrease is primarily attributable to a longer amortization period for the net actuarial losses partially offset by the amortization of higher unamortized net actuarial losses and the assumption of the full costs of certain defined benefit plans received from itt in connection with the spin off transferred plans 
beginning on january   we are using a new amortization period for the us salaried retirement plan us srp  our largest defined benefit pension plan  as a result of changes to the plan from the spin off and other plan modifications that caused almost all plan participants to stop accruing future benefits 
net actuarial losses are now amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants instead of the average remaining service period of plan participants 
in  we anticipate an increase of approximately to in net periodic benefit costs as compared to this increase is primarily attributable to lower expected long term rate of return on plan assets and higher amortization of net actuarial losses  partially offset by lower interest costs due to the decrease in the discount rate

backlog is converted into revenue as work is performed or deliveries are made 
the level of order activity related to defense programs can be affected by the timing of government funding authorizations and project evaluation cycles 
year over year comparisons could  at times  be impacted by these factors  among others 
funded orders received in decreased or to billion as compared to the decrease in funded awards was primarily driven by the absence of significant prior year contract awards and additional work orders under the k bosss  tacswacaa total army communications southwest asia  central asia and africa and logcap contracts within our information and technical services segment 
additionally  we experienced declines in orders within our crew  special purpose jammer and sincgars product lines within our cisr electronics and systems segment 
at december   total backlog was billion compared to billion at the end of total backlog decreased by billion primarily due to the absence of prior year increases related to key contract awards for tacswacaa  aps kuwait  k bosss  gps iii emd engineering  manufacturing and design  and electronic warfare systems on the special operations aircraft contract

if our cash flows from operations are less than we expect  we may need to access the short or long term capital markets 
we believe our credit facility and commercial paper program will permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions 
our access to  and the availability of  financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors  including i our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating  ii the liquidity of the overall capital markets  and iii the current state of the economy 
we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such financing will be available at all 
a significant portion of our cash is held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we manage our cash requirements considering available funds among our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
we continue to look for opportunities to access cash balances in excess of local operating requirements to meet liquidity needs in a cost efficient manner 
funding of pension plans funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations are a major consideration in making contributions to our us pension plans 
while the company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended by the pension protection act of and further amended by the worker  retiree  and employer recovery act of and applicable internal revenue code regulations  mandate minimum funding thresholds 
failure to satisfy the minimum funding thresholds could result in restrictions on our ability to amend the plan or make benefit payments 
with respect to us qualified pension plans  we intend to contribute annually not less than the required minimum funding thresholds 
the moving ahead for progress in the st century act  which was signed into law on july   includes an interest rate stabilization provision that will impact the minimum funding requirements 
this provision reduced our minimum funding thresholds in the second half of and we expect that it will reduce our minimum funding thresholds in and page 
table of contents at december   our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by billion 
in  we made total contributions of to our qualified pension plans 
we currently anticipate making contributions to our qualified pension plans in the range of to during future required contributions will depend primarily on the actual annual return on assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation at the end of each year 
depending on these factors  and the resulting funded status of our pension plans  the level of future statutory minimum contributions could be material

in the ordinary course of business  we use standby letters of credit  guarantees issued by commercial banks and surety bonds issued by insurance companies  as well as self guarantees  principally to guarantee our performance on certain contracts and to support our self insured workers compensation plans 
at december   there was an aggregate of approximately surety bonds  guarantees and stand by letters of credit outstanding 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no significant off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and certain indemnifications 
page 
table of contents indemnities we have acquired and disposed of numerous entities 
the related acquisition and disposition agreements contain various representation and warranty clauses and may provide indemnities for a misrepresentation or breach of the representations and warranties by either party 
the indemnities address a variety of subjects  the term and monetary amounts of each such indemnity are defined in the specific agreements and may be affected by various conditions and external factors 
many of the indemnities have expired either by operation of law or as a result of the terms of the agreement 
we do not have a liability recorded for the historic indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that we believe would give rise to material payments under such indemnities 
as part of the spin off  exelis provided or is provided certain indemnifications and cross indemnifications among itt and xylem inc the indemnifications address a variety of subjects 
we expect itt and xylem inc to fully perform under the terms of the agreements and therefore we have not recorded a liability for matters for which we will be indemnified 
in addition  we are not aware of any claims or other circumstances that would give rise to material payments to itt or xylem inc under the indemnity that we provide to them 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
estimates are revised as additional information becomes available 
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements are discussed in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they are inherently uncertain  involve significant judgments  include areas where different estimates reasonably could have been used  and changes in the estimates that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition as a defense contractor engaging in long term contracts  the majority of our revenue is derived from long term construction type and production type sales contracts and services provided to the federal government for which revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method based on units of delivery  percentage of costs incurred to total costs  or the completion of scheduled performance milestones 
for units of delivery  revenues and profits are recognized based upon the ratio of actual units delivered to estimated total units to be delivered under the contract 
under the cost to total cost method  revenue is recognized based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion 
revenue is recognized under the milestone method based upon accomplishing a clear deliverable output of contract performance with value to the customer 
revenue and profits on time and material type contracts are recognized based on billable rates times page 
table of contents direct labor hours incurred plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
the completed contract method is utilized when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made 
amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue  until the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced is recorded as a component of receivables  net 
during the performance of long term sale contracts  estimated final contract prices and costs are reviewed periodically and revisions are made as required and recorded in income in the period in which they are determined 
additionally  the fees under certain contracts may be increased or decreased in accordance with cost or performance incentive provisions which measure actual performance against established targets or other criteria 
such incentive fee awards or penalties are included in revenue when there is sufficient information to reasonably assess anticipated contract performance 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims  requests for equitable adjustment  or limitations in funding on contracts are recorded only if it is probable the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted long term contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined and are recorded as a component of costs of revenue 
contract revenue and cost estimates are reviewed and reassessed periodically 
changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch up adjustments to the contract s inception to date revenues  cost of revenue and profit in the period in which such changes are made  based on a contract s percent complete 
changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a forward loss or an adjustment to a forward loss 
for the years ended december   and  net favorable cumulative catch up adjustments related to prior periods increased operating income by approximately  and  respectively 
to a lesser extent  we enter into contracts that are not associated with the design  development  manufacture  or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services  and for services to non federal government customers 
for such contracts  we recognize revenue at the time title and risks and rewards of ownership pass  which is generally when products are shipped  or as services are performed if there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for agreements that contain multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue across all identified units of accounting based on relative fair values and then recognize revenue when the appropriate revenue recognition criteria for the individual deliverables have been satisfied 
postretirement benefit plans company employees participate in numerous defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans collectively referred to as defined benefit plans in the united states  which are sponsored by the company 
the determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to pension plans are dependent on various assumptions 
these major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates  long term expected rates of return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  mortality  termination and other factors some of which are disclosed in note  postretirement benefit plans  in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future life or service period of the plan participants 
beginning on january   we are using a new amortization period for the us srp  our largest defined benefit pension plan  as a result of changes to the plan from the spin off and other plan page 
table of contents modifications that caused almost all plan participants to stop accruing future benefits 
net actuarial losses are now amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants instead of the average remaining service period of plan participants 
significant assumptions management develops assumptions using relevant company experience  in conjunction with market related data for each plan 
assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as necessary 
the table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs as they pertain to our defined benefit pension plans  as of and for the years ended and year ended december  obligation assumptions discount rate rate of future compensation increase cost assumptions discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of future compensation increase cost assumptions for the current year are based on the prior year end obligation assumptions 
expected return on plan assets substantially all of our plan assets are managed on a commingled basis in a master investment trust 
we determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns 
specifically  the company analyzes the plan s actual historical annual return on assets over the past  and years  estimates future returns based on independent estimates of asset class returns  and evaluates historical broad market returns over long term timeframes based on our strategic target asset allocation  which is detailed in note  postretirement benefit plans  in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
based on this approach  the long term annual rate of return on assets is estimated at for  compared to in  and the chart below shows actual returns versus the expected long term returns for our pension plans that were utilized in the calculation of the net periodic pension cost for each respective year 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets actual rate of return on plan assets for the recognition of net periodic pension cost  the calculation of the expected return on plan assets is generally derived using a market related value of plan assets based on average asset values at the measurement date over the last five years 
the use of fair value  rather than a calculated value  could materially affect net periodic pension cost 
page 
table of contents discount rate the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future cash payments for benefits at the measurement date 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the discount rate assumption was based on current investment yields of high quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period 
the pension discount rate was determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising aaa aa bonds  with maturities between zero and thirty years  developed by the plan s actuaries 
annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single discount rate matching the plan s characteristics 
rate of future compensation increases the rate of future compensation increase assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
an increase in the rate of future compensation increases used to determine net periodic pension cost increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
sensitivity analysis pension expense a basis point change in the long term expected rate of return on plan assets  discount rate  or rate of future compensation increases  would have the following effect on the us srp s pension expense increase decrease in pension expense basis point increase basis point decrease long term rate of return on assets used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost rate of future compensation increases used to determine net periodic benefit cost funded status funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year end values of the projected benefit obligations from the fair value of plan assets 
we estimate that every basis point change in the discount rate of the us srp impacts the funded status by approximately fair value of plan assets the plan assets of our defined benefit plans comprise a broad range of investments  including domestic and international equity securities  fixed income investments  interests in private equity and hedge funds and cash and cash equivalents 
a substantial portion of our defined benefit plans asset portfolio is comprised of investments in private equity and hedge funds 
the private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured using the valuation of the underlying investments or at net asset value 
however  in certain instances  the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date 
accordingly  management has estimated adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date 
these adjustments consider information received from the asset managers  as well as general market information 
asset values for other page 
table of contents positions were generally measured using market observable prices 
see note  postretirement benefit plans in the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements for further information 
income taxes we determine the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not we will realize these benefits 
we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes to our estimate of the amount we are more likely than not to realize in the valuation allowance  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss  as appropriate 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies  and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
we have provided us deferred taxes on a portion of the excess of the financial reporting basis over the us tax basis for our foreign earnings  because we do not plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
the timing and amount of foreign earnings remittances are based on projected cash flow needs  as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective income tax rate 
the calculation of our income tax provision involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and to the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
furthermore  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate 
if our estimate proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional tax expense would result 
if these amounts ultimately prove to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities may result in a tax benefit in the period when the liabilities are no longer necessary 
prior to october   our income taxes as presented were calculated on a separate tax return basis and may not be reflective of the results that would have occurred on a standalone basis 
our operations were included in itt s us federal and state tax returns or non us jurisdictions tax returns prior to spin off 
subsequent to the spin off  we file our own consolidated income tax returns and we maintain taxes payable to and from federal and state taxing authorities

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we also review the carrying value of our finite lived intangible assets for potential impairment when impairment indicators arise 
we conduct our annual impairment test as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter 
we perform a two step impairment test for goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to measure the impairment loss to be recorded 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate fair value based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  particularly related to future operating results and cash flows 
these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and identification of appropriate market comparable data 
in addition  the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also requires judgment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the fair values of our reporting units are based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis indicated the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value 
all four reporting units fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values 
accordingly  no reporting units failed step one of the goodwill impairment test at december  in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value estimates on the goodwill impairment test  we applied three sensitivity tests to each of our four reporting units  a hypothetical basis point increase to the discount rates  a ten percent reduction in expected future cash flows  and a future terminal growth rate set to zero 
each of the reporting units passed each of the three sensitivity tests
