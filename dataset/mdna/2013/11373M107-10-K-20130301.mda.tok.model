item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction brookline bancorp  inc  a delaware corporation  operates as a multi bank holding company for brookline bank and its subsidiaries  bankri and its subsidiaries  first ipswich and its subsidiaries  and brookline securities corp 
the company has no significant assets other than the common stock of the banks 
for this reason  substantially all of the discussion in this document relates to the operations of the banks and their subsidiaries 
the company commercially focused business strategy  its niche business lines and its customer responsiveness have played a key role in growing the business and differentiating the company from its competitors 
through its full service banks  the company works to create long term relationships with each customer  built upon excellent customer service 
the company manages the banks under uniform strategic objectives  one set of uniform policies consistently applied and one executive management team 
within this environment  the company believes that the ability to make customer decisions locally enhances management motivation  service levels and  as a consequence  the company financial results 
the competition for loans and leases and deposits remains intense 
in addition to this competition  the national economic recovery remains weak and the rate of unemployment high 
while the economy in massachusetts and  in particular  the greater boston metropolitan area has remained relatively stable  the unemployment rate in massachusetts peaked at in october  a level not seen since  before declining to in december meanwhile  the unemployment rate in rhode island peaked at in january  a level not seen in more than years  before declining to in december slow economic growth has made it difficult for some of the company loan and lease customers to make their payments and  as a result  the company experienced loan and lease losses that were higher than historic levels  particularly in its indirect automobile and equipment financing portfolios 
while there have been signs recently that the economy has started to gradually improve  the company expects the operating environment in to remain challenging 
the volume of loan and lease originations and loan and lease losses will depend  to a large extent  on how the economy performs 
loan and lease growth and deposit growth are also greatly influenced by the rate setting actions of the fomc 
the fomc lowered the rate for overnight federal fund borrowings between banks from in september to a target range between zero and in december  the rate currently in effect 
these low interest rates have had and may continue to have an ongoing negative impact on the company yields and net interest margin 
conversely  rising rates in the future could cause changes in the mix and volume of the company deposits and make it more difficult for certain borrowers to be eligible for new loans or leases or to service their existing debt 
the future operating results of the company will depend on its ability to maintain net interest margin  while minimizing exposure to credit risk  along with increasing sources of non interest income  while controlling the growth of non interest or operating expenses 
executive overview growth business fundamentals remained strong throughout the year ended december  total assets at december  grew to billion  an increase of from december  after adjustment for the billion of total assets acquired from bankri on january  the loan and lease portfolio grew to billion as of december   up from december   after adjustment for the billion in loans and leases acquired from bankri on january  this growth results largely from the increase in commercial real estate loans and commercial loans and 
table of contents leases 
these portfolios increased to billion  an increase of for the full year after adjustment for the million in commercial real estate and commercial loan and lease portfolios acquired from bancorp rhode island 
deposit growth also continued with total deposits up from december  after exclusion of the billion of acquired bankri deposits 
the company core deposits increased as a percentage of total deposits from at december  to at december  the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was at december  and is less than the ratio at december  of 
this reduction in the allowance to loans and leases ratio from december  to december  is a result of applying purchase accounting to loans acquired in the bankri acquisition  accounting that eliminated bankri pre acquisition allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses related to originated loans and leases as a percentage of the total originated loan and lease portfolio  including deferred loan origination costs  is as compared with as of december  the increase is largely related to the risk of bankri originated loans and leases throughout the company continued to employ its historical underwriting methodology throughout the year ended december  and continued to calculate its allowance for loan and lease losses on a historically consistent basis 
this ratio may continue to increase in connection with increased levels of organic growth in future periods 
net charge offs for the year ended december  were million  or of average loans and leases  compared to for the year ended december  nonperforming assets at december  totaled million or of total assets  as compared with million  or of total assets  at december  the company remains well capitalized as defined by its regulatory requirements with capital ratios in excess of all minimum regulatory requirements 
the company tier leverage ratio was at december  brookline bancorp  inc tangible equity ratio of  down from at december   reflects the company acquisition of bankri 
income for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  up from the year ended december  the annualized return on average assets was for the year ended december   and the annualized return on average stockholders equity was for the year ended december  net earnings from operations  which exclude acquisition related expenses  were million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  as compared to million and per diluted share for the year ended december  operating returns on average assets and average stockholders equity  at an annualized rate  were and  respectively  for the year ended december  net interest margin was for the year ended december  the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points from in to in  largely due to continued rate pressures on the commercial real estate and indirect automobile portfolios 
the yield on interest earning assets benefited in part from periodic yield adjustments on acquired loans of million recorded in the third quarter 
the relative consistency in the net interest margin in a highly competitive and declining interest rate environment is  in part  a result of a reduction of basis points in the company overall cost of funds  from in to in  as well as the decrease in the company loan to deposit ratio from at december  to at december  despite the strength of the company net interest margin  competitive pricing pressure in all loan categories and the continuation of a low interest rate environment  along with the company 
table of contents diminishing ability to reduce its cost of funds  continues to place significant pressure on the company net interest margin and net interest income 
results for included a million provision for credit losses  of which million was recorded in the second quarter in connection with the two bankri commercial loans discussed in the allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and lease losses commercial loans and leases section beginning on page despite the increase in provision related to the two bankri commercial loans  credit quality remained strong throughout non interest income increased million from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  in part as a result of million of non interest income attributable to bankri and in part as a result of million in net gains on sales of leases and securities 
non interest expense increased million  or  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was largely attributable to the partial addition of bankri expenses  acquisition related expenses of million in the first quarter of  and costs associated with the company ongoing infrastructure build 
compensation and employee benefit expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended and professional services expenses were million in as compared to million in critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to understanding the company financial condition and operating results 
such accounting policies are considered to be especially important because they involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in the company operating results or financial condition 
investment securities securities classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
the market values of the company securities  particularly its fixed rate securities  are affected by changes in market interest rates as determined by the term structure of risk free rates and the credit spreads associated with different investment categories 
in general  as interest rates rise  the fair value of fixed rate securities will decrease  as interest rates fall  the fair value of fixed rate securities will increase 
on a quarterly basis  the company reviews and evaluates fair value based on market data obtained from independent sources or  in the absence of active market data  from model derived valuations based on market assumptions 
if the company deems any decline to be other than temporary  the amount of impairment loss recorded in earnings for a debt security is the entire difference between the security cost and its fair value if the company intends to sell the debt security prior to recovery or it is more likely than not that the company will have to sell the debt security prior to recovery 
if  however  the company does not intend to sell the debt security or it concludes that it is more likely than not that the company will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery  the credit loss component of an other than temporary impairment of a debt security is recognized as a charge to earnings and the remaining portion of the impairment loss is recognized as a reduction in comprehensive income 
the credit loss component of an other than temporary loss is 
table of contents determined based on the company best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected 
impairment losses charged to earnings in  and were   and  respectively 
acquired loans loans that the company acquired are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan and lease losses 
determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest 
the company will continue to evaluate the reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments  and in some cases may result in a loan being considered impaired 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
losses on loans and leases are deducted from the allowance when all or a portion of a loan or lease is considered uncollectable 
the determination of the loans on which full collectability is not reasonably assured  the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral  and the assessment of economic and other conditions are subject to assumptions and judgments by management 
valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in  or different interpretations of  these assumptions and judgments 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis and reviews its conclusion as to the amount to be established with the audit committee and the board of directors 
see note  allowance for loan and lease losses  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on how management determines the balance of the allowance for loan and lease losses for each portfolio and class of loans 
goodwill goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is tested at least annually for impairment 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if fair value exceeds the carrying amount at the time of testing  goodwill is not considered impaired 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are considered to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include present value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues  or similar performance measures 
differences in valuation techniques could result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu addressing the topic of testing goodwill for impairment 
the objective of the asu is to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the asu permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 
in reaching its conclusion about whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  an entity should consider the extent to which each of the adverse events or circumstances identified could affect the comparison of a reporting unit fair value with its carrying amount 
an entity should place more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect 
table of contents a reporting unit fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets  and may affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the following qualitative factors have been assessed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill general economic conditions  regulatory environment  share price  real estate values  lending concentrations  interest rate environment  asset quality  capital  financial performance  integration of acquired companies and conversion to a new data processing system 
goodwill impairment testing was performed at the consolidated level for the company as of december  based on an evaluation of the qualitative factors mentioned above and assessing the effect identified adverse events or circumstances could have  the company has concluded there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
identified intangible assets identified intangible assets are assets resulting from acquisitions that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the recoverability of identified intangible assets is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
if impairment is deemed to have occurred  the amount of impairment is charged to expense when identified 
income taxes certain areas of accounting for income taxes require management judgment  including determining the expected realization of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
judgments are made regarding various tax positions  which are often subjective and involve assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain 
if actual factors and conditions differ materially from estimates made by management  the actual realization of the net deferred tax assets or liabilities for uncertain tax positions could vary materially from the amounts previously recorded 
deferred tax assets arise from items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in future income tax returns  for which a financial statement tax benefit has already been recognized 
the realization of the net deferred tax asset generally depends upon future levels of taxable income and the existence of prior years taxable income to which refund claims could be carried back 
valuation allowances are recorded against those deferred tax assets determined not likely to be realized 
deferred tax liabilities represent items that will require a future tax payment 
they generally represent tax expense recognized in the company financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or a deduction taken on the company tax return but not yet recognized as an expense in the company financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities are also recognized for certain non cash items such as goodwill 
non gaap financial measures and reconciliation to gaap in addition to evaluating the company results of operations in accordance with gaap  management periodically supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non gaap financial measures  such as the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to originated loans and leases  operating earnings metrics  the efficiency and tangible equity ratios  tangible book value per share and dividend payout ratio 
management believes that these non gaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the company underlying operating performance and trends  and facilitates comparisons with the performance assessment of financial performance  including non interest expense control  while the tangible equity ratio and tangible book value per share are used to analyze the relative strength of the company capital position 

table of contents operating earnings operating earnings exclude acquisition related and other expenses from net income  by excluding such items  the company results can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period 
items excluded from operating earnings  which include  but are not limited to  acquisition related expenses  and other charges related to executive level management separation and severance related costs  are also excluded when calculating the operating efficiency ratio 
in light of diversity in presentation among financial institutions  the methodologies used by the company for determining the non gaap financial measures discussed above may differ from those used by other financial institutions

the company also provides financing for construction and development projects  home equity and other consumer loans 

table of contents the company employs seasoned commercial lenders and retail bankers who rely on community and business contacts as well as referrals from customers  attorneys and other professionals to generate loans and deposits 
existing borrowers are also an important source of business since many of them have more than one loan outstanding with the company 
the company ability to originate loans depends on the strength of the economy  trends in interest rates  customer demands and competition 
it is the company current policy that the aggregate amount of loans outstanding to any one borrower or related entities may not exceed million unless approved by the executive committee of the board of directors 
at december   there were no borrowers with aggregated loans outstanding of million or greater 
there were borrowers each with aggregate loans outstanding of million or greater at december  the cumulative total of those loans was million or of total loans outstanding at december  the company has written underwriting policies to control the inherent risks in loan origination 
the policies address approval limits  loan to value ratios  appraisal requirements  debt service coverage ratios  loan concentration limits and other matters relevant to loan underwriting 
to this end  the company sold million in equipment financing loans in  at a gain of million  in order to reduce franchisee concentrations 
commercial real estate loans the commercial real estate portfolio is comprised of commercial real estate mortgage loans  multi family mortgage loans  and construction loans and is the largest component of the company overall loan portfolio  representing of total loans and leases outstanding including deferred loan origination costs at december  for the commercial real estate portfolio  the company focuses on making loans in the million to million range 
typically  commercial real estate loans are larger in size and involve a greater degree of risk than owner occupied residential mortgage loans 
loan repayment is usually dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties and the value of the properties securing the loans 
economic conditions can greatly affect cash flows and property values 
a number of factors are considered in originating commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans 
the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower including credit history  as well as the potential income generation and the value and condition of the underlying property  are evaluated 
when evaluating the qualifications of the borrower  the company considers the financial resources of the borrower  the borrower experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower payment history with the company and other financial institutions 
factors considered in evaluating the underlying property include the net operating income of the mortgaged premises before debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio the ratio of cash flow before debt service to debt service  the use of conservative capitalization rates  and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value 
generally  personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate loan borrowers 
commercial real estate and multi family mortgage loans are typically originated for terms of five years with amortization periods of to years 
many of the loans are priced at inception on a fixed rate basis generally for periods ranging from two to five years with repricing periods for longer term loans 
when possible  prepayment penalties are included in loan covenants on these loans 
brookline bank urban and suburban market area is characterized by a large number of apartment buildings  condominiums and office buildings 
as a result  multi family and commercial real estate mortgage lending has been a significant part of brookline bank activities for many years 
these types of loans typically generate higher yields  but also involve greater credit risk 
many of brookline 
table of contents bank borrowers have more than one multi family or commercial real estate loan outstanding with brookline bank 
over of the commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  were secured by properties located in new england 
the commercial real estate portfolio at that date was composed primarily of loans secured by office buildings million  retail stores million  industrial properties million apartment buildings million  and mixed use properties million 
construction and development financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than long term financing on improved  occupied real estate and thus has higher concentration limits than do other commercial credit classes 
risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of construction costs  the estimated time to sell or rent the completed property at an adequate price or rate of occupancy  and market conditions 
if the estimates and projections prove to be inaccurate  the company may be confronted with a project which  upon completion  has a value that is insufficient to assure full loan repayment 
criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the sale of the property are different from the criteria applied in underwriting construction loans for which the primary source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project 
for those loans where the primary source of repayment is from resale of the property  in addition to the normal credit analysis performed for other loans  the company also analyzes project costs  the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and demand within the market area 
for those construction loans where the source of repayment is the stabilized cash flow from the completed project  the company analyzes not only project costs but also how long it might take to achieve satisfactory occupancy and the reasonableness of projected rental rates in relation to market rental rates 
historically  construction and development lending has comprised a modest part of the company loan originations 
at december   originated construction loans equaled million  or of total loans outstanding including deferred loan origination costs at that date 
commercial loans this portfolio is comprised of commercial loans  equipment financing loans and leases and condominium association loans and represented of total loans outstanding including deferred loan origination costs at december  the company focuses on making commercial loans in the million to million range 
the company provides commercial banking services to companies in its market area 
over of the commercial loans outstanding at december  were made to borrowers located in new england 
product offerings include lines of credit  term loans  letters of credit  deposit services and cash management 
these types of credit facilities have as their primary source of repayment cash flows from the operations of a business 
interest rates offered are available on a floating basis tied to the prime rate or a similar index or on a fixed rate basis referenced on the fhlbb index 
credit extensions are made to established businesses on the basis of an analysis of their financial statements  the nature of collateral to secure the credit extension and  in most instances  the personal guarantee of the owner of the business 
the company also participates in us government programs such as the small business administration the sba in both the a program and as an sba preferred lender 
the equipment financing portfolio is composed primarily of loans to finance coin operated laundry  dry cleaning  fitness  and convenience store equipment and  most recently  tow trucks 
the borrowers are located primarily in the greater new york new jersey metropolitan area  although the 
table of contents customer base extends to locations throughout the united states 
typically  the loans are priced at a fixed rate of interest and require monthly payments over their three to seven year life 
the yields earned on equipment financing loans are higher than those earned on the commercial loans made by the banks because they involve a higher degree of credit risk 
equipment financing customers are typically small business owners who operate with limited financial resources and who face greater risks when the economy weakens or unforeseen adverse events arise 
because of these characteristics  personal guarantees of borrowers are usually obtained along with liens on available assets 
the company focuses on making equipment financing loans and leases in the  to  range 
the company equipment financing divisions focus on market niches in which its lenders have deep experience and industry contacts  and on making loans to customers with business experience 
an important part of the company equipment financing loan origination volume comes from equipment manufacturers and existing customers as they expand their operations 
the size of loan is determined by an analysis of cash flow and other characteristics pertaining to the business and the equipment to be financed  based on detailed revenue and profitability data of similar operations 
of the loans and leases originated in  involved the payment of a referral or broker fee which is deferred and amortized on a level yield basis over the life of the loan 
loans to condominium associations are for the purpose of funding capital improvements  are made for five to ten year terms and are secured by a general assignment of condominium association revenues 
among the factors considered in the underwriting of such loans are the level of owner occupancy  the financial condition and history of the condominium association  the attractiveness of the property in relation to the market in which it is located and the reasonableness of estimates of the cost of capital improvements to be made 
depending on loan size  funds are advanced as capital improvements are made and  in more complex situations  after completion of engineering inspections 
indirect automobile loans this loan portfolio represented of total loans outstanding including deferred loan origination costs at december  loans outstanding in the portfolio totaled million at december   down from million at december  although in the automobile industry reported the highest sales since  competition for these loans increased significantly as credit unions and large national banks entered indirect automobile lending in a search for additional sources of income 
that competition drove interest rates down and  in some cases  changed the manner in which interest rates are developed  ie from including a dealer shared spread to requiring a dealer based fee to originate the loan 
depending on the terms of the dealer enrollment agreement with the company  the dealer earns this fee days after a loan is originated or once the borrower makes at least three payments on the loan 
indirect automobile loans are for the purchase of automobiles both new and used and light duty trucks primarily by individuals  but also by corporations and other organizations 
the loans are originated through over dealerships located primarily in massachusetts  but also in connecticut  rhode island and new hampshire 
dealer relationships are reviewed periodically for application quality  the ratio of loans approved to applications submitted and loan performance 
loan applications are generated by approved dealers and data are entered into an application processing system 
a credit bureau scorecard model is used in the underwriting process 
the model is based on data accumulated by nationally recognized credit bureaus and is a risk assessment tool that analyzes an individual credit history and assigns a numeric credit score 
the model meets the requirements of the equal credit opportunity act 
the application processing system sorts each application according to score ranges 
loans must meet criteria established in the company loan policy 
credit profile measurements such as debt to income ratios  payment to income ratios and loan to value ratios are utilized in the underwriting process and to monitor the performance of loans 
table of contents falling within specified ratio ranges 
regarding loan to value ratios  the company considers indirect automobile loans to be essentially credits that are less than fully collateralized 
when borrowers cease to make required payments  repossession and sale of the vehicle financed usually results in insufficient funds to fully pay the remaining loan balance 
while the company indirect automobile loan policy permits the aggregate amount of loans with credit scores of or below to comprise as much as of loans outstanding  at december   loans with credit scores of or below were of loans outstanding 
the average dollar original weighted credit score of loans in the portfolio at that date was see the subsection provision for credit losses appearing elsewhere herein for further information regarding loan underwriting and the average credit scores of the borrowers to whom indirect automobile loans were made 
all loans require the purchase of single interest insurance by the borrower 
the insurance is designed to protect the company from loss when a loan is in default and the collateral value is impaired due to vehicle damage or the company is unable to take possession of the vehicle 
indirect automobile loans are assigned a particular tier based on the credit score determined by the credit bureau 
the tier is used for pricing purposes only so as to assure consistency in loan pricing 
tier rates can be modified if certain conditions exist as outlined in the company loan policy 
the rate paid by a borrower usually differs with the buy rate earned by the company 
for approximately of the indirect automobile loans originated in  a significant part of the difference between the two rates is retained by the dealer in accordance with terms agreed to between the dealer and the company 
the difference is commonly referred to as the spread 
all of the spread is paid after the end of the month in which the loan is made and is comprised of the agreed upon rate differential multiplied by the expected average balance of the loan over its scheduled maturity 
if a loan is repaid in its entirety within days or before three payments have been made depending on the agreement with the dealer  the dealer must pay the remainder of unamortized spread to the company 
if a loan is repaid after days or after three payments have been made depending on the agreement with the dealer  the dealer is not obliged to repay any part of the spread amount previously received 
spread payments to dealers are amortized as a reduction of interest received from borrowers over the life of the related loans 
when loans are prepaid  any remaining unamortized balance is charged to expense at that time 
for approximately of the indirect automobile loans originated in  brookline bank paid a flat fee to the dealers to procure the loan 
this fee is deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
for the remaining of indirect automobile loans originated in  there was no spread or flat fee paid to the dealers associated with the procurement of the loan 
various reports are generated to monitor receipt of required loan documents  adherence to loan policy parameters  dealer performance  loan delinquencies and loan charge offs 
summary reports are submitted to the chief credit officer  the chief financial officer and the board of directors on a monthly basis 
consumer loans this portfolio is comprised of residential mortgage loans  home equity loans and lines  and other consumer loans and represented of total loans outstanding including deferred loan origination costs at december  the company focuses its mortgage loans on existing customers within its branch networks in its urban and suburban marketplaces in the greater boston and providence metropolitan areas 
the company originates adjustable and fixed rate residential mortgage loans secured by one to four family residences on a servicing released basis 
in general  the company maintains three  five and seven year adjustable rate mortgage loans and ten year fixed rate fully amortizing mortgage loans in its portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans with maturities beyond ten years  such as and year fixed rate mortgages  are not generally maintained in the company portfolio but are rather sold into 
table of contents the secondary market 
during  brookline bank acted as a correspondent bank in these secondary market transactions  while bankri acted as broker 
loan sales in the secondary market provide funds for additional lending and other banking activities 
each residential mortgage loan granted is subject to a satisfactorily completed application  employment verification  credit history and a demonstrated ability to repay the debt 
generally  loans are not made when the loan to value ratio exceeds unless private mortgage insurance is obtained and or there is a financially strong guarantor 
appraisals are performed by outside independent fee appraisers 
underwriting guidelines for home equity loans and lines of credit are similar to those for residential mortgage loans 
home equity loans and lines of credit are limited to no more than of the appraised value of the property securing the loan less the amount of any existing first mortgage liens 
other consumer loans have historically been a modest part of the company loan originations

these loans and leases are collectively referred to as criticized assets 
loans and leases rated as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management close attention 
if left uncorrected  these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects of the loan or lease at some future date 
loans and leases rated as substandard are inadequately protected by the payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard loans and leases have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if existing deficiencies are not corrected

under certain circumstances  the company may restructure the terms of a loan or lease as a concession to a borrower  except for acquired loans which are individually evaluated against expected performance on the date of acquisition 
these restructured loans and leases are generally considered nonperforming loans and leases until a history of collection of at least six months on the restructured terms of the loan or lease has been established 
oreo consists of real estate acquired through foreclosure proceedings and real estate acquired through acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
other repossessed assets consist of assets that have been acquired through foreclosure that are not real estate and are included in other assets on the company consolidated balance sheets 
accrual of interest on loans generally is discontinued when contractual payment of principal or interest becomes past due days or  if in management judgment  reasonable doubt exists as to the full timely collection of interest 
exceptions may be made if the loan has matured and is in the process of renewal or is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current interest income 
interest payments on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal 
if collection of the principal is reasonably assured  interest payments are recognized as income on the cash basis 
loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are current  full collectability of principal and interest is reasonably assured and a consistent record of performance has been achieved 
in cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and the company makes certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms  the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan 
in determining whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties  the company considers  among other factors  if the debtor is in payment default or is likely to be in payment default in the foreseeable future without the modification  the debtor declared or is in the process of declaring bankruptcy  there is substantial doubt that the debtor will continue as a going concern  the debtor entity specific projected cash flows will not be sufficient to service its debt  or the debtor cannot obtain funds from sources other than the existing creditors at market terms for debt with similar risk characteristics 
at december   the company had loans and leases including deferred origination costs greater than days past due and accruing of million  or of total loans and leases  compared to million  or of total loans and leases at december   representing an increase of million  or of total loans and leases 
the increase was related primarily to the addition of asc loans acquired in the bankri acquisition which are greater than days past due but are considered to be accruing due to acquisition related fair value adjustments 
at december   the company had nonperforming assets including deferred origination costs of million  representing of total assets  compared to nonperforming assets of million  or of total assets at december   representing an increase of million  or of total assets 
this increase includes the addition of million in nonperforming assets due to the bankri acquisition and million in nonperforming assets related to the two bankri commercial loans discussed in the allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and lease losses commercial loans and leases section beginning on page the company evaluates the underlying collateral of each nonperforming loan and lease and continues to pursue the collection of interest and principal 
management believes that the current level of nonperforming assets remains manageable relative to the size of the company loan and lease portfolio 
if economic conditions were to worsen or if the marketplace were to experience prolonged economic stress  management believes it is likely that the level of nonperforming assets would increase  as would the level of charged off loans

allowances for credit losses allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of general  specific and unallocated allowances and reflects management estimate of probable loan and lease losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
management uses a consistent and systematic process and methodology to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is calculated by loan type commercial real estate loans  commercial loans and leases  indirect automobile loans and consumer loans  each category of which is further segregated 
a formula based credit evaluation approach is applied to each group  coupled with an analysis of certain loans for impairment 
the process to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses requires management to exercise considerable judgment regarding the risk characteristics of the loan portfolios and the effect of relevant internal and external factors 
while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
management performs a comprehensive review of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution allowance for loan and lease losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
see note  basis of presentation  and note  allowance for loan and lease losses  to the consolidated financial statements for descriptions of how management determines the balance of the allowance for loan and lease losses for each portfolio and class of loans

this compared to an allowance for loan and lease losses of million or of total loans and leases outstanding at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases is largely a result of the addition of bankri loans and leases to the total amount of company loans and leases  without a simultaneous addition of historical  pre acquisition allowance for loan and lease losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses as of december  is appropriate based on the facts and circumstances discussed further below 
commercial real estate loans the allowance for commercial real estate loan losses was million or of total commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  this compared to an allowance for commercial real estate loan losses of million or of commercial real estate loans outstanding at december  the million increase in the allowance for commercial real estate loans during was primarily driven by originated loan growth of over the same period

table of contents included in the million increase in the allowance is a million increase in reserves for loans specifically evaluated for impairment  from no reserve on loan balances of million at december  to a million reserve on loan balances of million at december  management evaluates several factors in determining whether an impaired loan requires a specific reserve  including the borrower ability to service the loan  guarantor support and the value of available collateral  and believes these reserve levels are adequate 
net charge offs recoveries were stable and comparable to prior periods 
net recoveries totaled million  or of average loans and leases for the twelve months ended december   compared with  in net charge offs for the twelve months ended december  provisions for commercial real estate loans recorded in these periods more than adequately covered charge offs during those periods

at june   the company liquidated approximately million of available collateral 
of the remaining million in outstanding loans  the company recorded associated charge offs of million and established a specific allowance for loan losses of million 
during the third quarter of  the company entered into a settlement agreement with the borrower 
in connection with the settlement agreement  payments of million were received and an additional million was charged off to the specific reserve established in the second quarter of no additional specific reserves or provision were recorded in association with this relationship during the third or fourth quarters of the carrying value of the loans at december  was million 

table of contents provisions for commercial loans recorded in these periods more than adequately covered charge offs 
see the results of operations provision for credit losses section below for additional information 
indirect automobile loans the allowance for indirect automobile loan losses was million or of total indirect automobile loans outstanding at december   compared to million or of the indirect automobile portfolio outstanding at december  the indirect automobile portfolio declined from december  to december  credit quality metrics improved as older  riskier loans ran off and were replaced with higher quality loans 
the ratio of indirect automobile loans with borrower credit scores below to the total indirect automobile portfolio including deferred origination costs decreased steadily to at december  from at december  there were no loans individually evaluated for impairment in the indirect automobile portfolio at december  net charge offs in the indirect automobile portfolio totaled million or of average loans for the twelve months ended december  versus net charge offs of million or for the twelve months ended december  these charge off metrics seem to further corroborate the favorable trend in credit quality within this portfolio

consumer loans the allowance for consumer loan losses  including residential loans and home equity loans and lines of credit  was million or of total consumer loans outstanding at december  this compared to an allowance for consumer loan losses of million or of consumer loans outstanding at december  the million increase in the allowance for consumer loans during was primarily driven by originated loan growth of 
the ratio of originated residential and home equity loans with loan to value ratios greater than increased to of total originated residential and home equity loans including deferred origination costs at december  from at december  furthermore the ratio of originated consumer loans on nonaccrual to total originated consumer loans including deferred origination costs trended flat to at december  from at december  management evaluates several factors in determining whether an impaired loan requires a specific reserve  including the borrower ability to service the loan  guarantor support and the value of available collateral  and believes these reserve levels are adequate 
included in the million increase in the allowance is a million increase in reserves for loans specifically evaluated for impairment  from  on loan balances of million at december  to million on loan balances of million at december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of eight residential loans from borrowers facing financial difficulty which were deemed impaired during the year 
net charge offs in the consumer loan portfolio totaled million or of average loans for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  in net charge offs for the twelve months ended december  though credit quality metrics were mixed in the first half of the year  they have returned to more normal levels in recent months 

table of contents unallocated allowance the unallocated allowance recognizes the estimation risk associated with the allocated general and specific allowances  incorporates management evaluation of existing conditions that are not included in the allocated allowance determinations and protects against potential losses outside of the ordinary course of business 
these conditions are reviewed quarterly by management and include general economic conditions  credit quality trends and internal loan review and regulatory examination findings 
causes of losses outside the normal course of business include but are not limited to fraudulently obtained loans where there is no primary or secondary source of repayment  catastrophic and uninsured property loss where collateral is destroyed with no compensation  and legal documentation flaws that compromise security interests in collateral assets or the availability of guarantors 
the unallocated allowance for loan and lease losses was million at december   compared to million at december  the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses declined by million on a year to year basis at december   largely as a result of improvements in the economic environment in the greater boston marketplace

total securities increased million  or since december  at january   the company acquired million of securities in the bankri acquisition 
at december   bankri contributed million to the securities portfolio 
total investment securities were of total assets at december   an increase from december   when total securities were of total assets 
maturities  calls and principal repayments totaled million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the same period in in  the company sold securities of million and realized gains of million compared to sales of million and gains of million for the sales in were initiated to restructure the government sponsored enterprise gse mortgage backed security mbs and gse collateralized mortgage obligation cmo portfolios acquired in the bankri acquisition which  because of coupon rates ranging from to  were prepaying at rapid rates in comparison to the fhlbb advances which funded the investments 
accordingly  in  the company purchased million of available for sale securities compared to million in investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value  which is primarily obtained from a third party pricing service 
at december   the fair value of investment securities available for sale was million and carried a total of million of net unrealized gains  compared to million at december  the change in the unrealized loss of the remaining securities available for sale is due to general market concerns about the liquidity and creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities 
management believes that it will recover the amortized cost basis of the 
table of contents investment securities and that it is more likely than not that it will not sell the securities before recovery 
as such  management has determined that the securities are not other than temporarily impaired as of december  if market conditions for securities worsen or the creditworthiness of the underlying issuers deteriorates  it is possible that the company may recognize additional other than temporary impairments in future periods 
us government sponsored enterprises the company invests in securities issued by government sponsored enterprises gses  including gse debt securities  mortgage backed securities mbss  and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
gse securities include obligations issued by fnma  freddie mac  the government national mortgage association gnma  the federal home loan banks and the federal farm credit bank 
at december   none of those obligations is backed by the full faith and credit of the us government  except for gnma mortgage backed securities mbss and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and small business administration sba commercial loan asset backed securities with an estimated fair value of million 
gse securities are considered attractive investments because they generate positive yields with minimal administrative expense  impose minimal credit risk as a result of the guarantees usually provided  can be utilized as collateral for borrowings  generate cash flows useful for liquidity management and are qualified thrift investments for purposes of the thrift lender test that the company is obliged to meet for regulatory purposes 
at december   issuers of gse debentures with an estimated fair value of million  or of total gse debentures of million  had the right to call or prepay the obligations 
at december   issuers of gse debentures with an estimated fair value of million  or of total gse debentures of million  had the right to call or prepay the obligations 
at both december  and  issuers of all of the gse mbss  cmos and sba commercial loan asset backed securities in the company investment portfolio had the right to call or prepay the obligations 
mortgage related securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate that is less than the average interest rate on the underlying mortgages 
mortgage related securities purchased by the company generally are comprised of a pool of single family mortgages 
the issuers of such securities are generally gses such as fnma  freddie mac and gnma which pool and resell participation interests in the form of securities to investors and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to the investors 
investments in mortgage related securities issued and guaranteed by gses generally do not entail significant credit risk 
such investments  however  are susceptible to significant interest rate and cash flow risks when actual cash flows from the investments differ from cash flows estimated at the time of purchase 
additionally  the market value of such securities can be affected adversely by market changes in interest rates 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of a security and result in the accelerated expensing of any premiums paid  thereby reducing the net yield earned on the security 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of declining interest rates  refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of underlying mortgages and the related security 
such an occurrence can also create reinvestment risk because of the unavailability of other investments with a comparable rate of return in relation to the nature and maturity of the alternative investment 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  prepayments may decline  thereby extending the estimated life of the security and depriving the company of the ability to reinvest cash flows at the higher market rates of interest 

table of contents cmos are a type of debt security issued by a special purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage related securities and creates different classes of cmo securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics 
the cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into tranches  or classes  whereby tranches have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest repayment of the underlying mortgages and mortgage related securities  as opposed to pass through mortgage backed securities where cash flows are distributed pro rata to all security holders 
in contrast to mortgage backed securities from which cash flow is received pro rata by all security holders and hence  prepayment risk is shared  the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage related securities underlying cmos is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities 
a particular tranche of a cmo may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches 
generally  the company has invested in the first tranche of cmos 
as of december   the company held gse mortgage related securities with a total fair value of million and a net unrealized gain of million 
during  the company purchased a total of million in gse cmos and gse mbss to reinvest matured cash flow and rebalance the bankri portfolio from high coupon  quickly prepaying gse mbss into lower coupon gse cmos and gse mbss with slower prepayment speeds 
auction rate municipal obligations and municipal obligations the auction rate obligations owned by the company were rated aaa at the time of acquisition due  in part  to the guarantee of third party insurers who would have to pay the obligations if the issuers failed to pay the obligations when they become due 
during the financial crisis  certain third party insurers experienced financial difficulties and were not able to meet their contractual obligations 
as a result  auctions failed to attract a sufficient number of investors and created a liquidity problem for those investors who were relying on the obligations to be redeemed at auction 
since then  there has not been an active market for auction rate municipal obligations 
based on an evaluation of market factors  the estimated fair value of the auction rate municipal obligations owned by the company at december  was million with a corresponding net unrealized loss of million 
full collection of the obligations is expected because the financial condition of the issuers is sound  none of the issuers has defaulted on scheduled payments  the obligations are rated investment grade and the company has the ability and intent to hold the obligations for a period of time to recover the unrealized losses 
see note  investment securities  to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company investments in auction rate municipal obligations

the company owned eight corporate obligation securities with a total fair value of million and total net unrealized gains of 
table of contents million as of december  all but one of the securities are investment grade 
this non investment grade security is currently in an unrealized gain position 
trust preferred securities trust preferred securities represent subordinated debt issued by financial institutions 
these securities are sometimes pooled and sold to investors through structured vehicles known as pretsls 
when issued  pretsls are divided into tranches or segments that establish priority rights to cash flows from the underlying trust preferred securities 
at december   the company owned three trust preferred securities and two pretsl pools with a total fair value of million and a total net unrealized loss of million 
the company monitors these pools closely for impairment due to a history of defaults experienced on the part of the banks underlying the trust preferred securities 
during a third pooled trust preferred security known as pretsl a was called and the company received a final payment of million of principal and interest after recording a total of million in other than temporary impairment otti on this security in no charges have been recorded since  due to the prospects of the trust preferred issuers  the excess subordination on the pretsls and the company ability and intent to hold the securities to recovery

table of contents results of operations the primary drivers of the company net income are net interest income  which is strongly affected by the net yield on interest earning assets and liabilities net interest margin  the quality of the company assets  its levels of non interest income and non interest expense  and its tax provision 
the company net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on its investments  loans and leases  and its cost of funds 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the yield earned thereon 
cost of funds is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the year and the interest rates paid thereon 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets 
net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the increases decreases in the components of interest income and interest expense  expressed in terms of fluctuation in average volume and rate  are summarized under rate volume analysis on page information as to the components of interest income  interest expense and average rates is provided under average balances  net interest income  interest rate spread and net interest margin on page because the company assets and liabilities are not identical in duration and in repricing dates  the differential between the asset and liability repricing and duration is vulnerable to changes in market interest rates as well as the overall shape of the yield curve 
these vulnerabilities are inherent to the business of banking and are commonly referred to as interest rate risk 
how interest rate risk is measured and  once measured  how much interest rate risk is taken are based on numerous assumptions and other subjective judgments 
see the discussion in the measuring interest rate risk section of item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  on pages to the quality of the company assets also influences its earnings 
loans and leases that are not paid on a timely basis and exhibit other weaknesses can result in the loss of principal and or interest income 
additionally  the company must make timely provisions to the allowance for loan and lease losses based on estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
these additions  which are charged against earnings  are necessarily greater when greater probable losses are expected

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk that the market value or estimated fair value of the company assets  liabilities  and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility  or that the company net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes 
interest rate risk the principal market risk facing the company is interest rate risk  which can come in a variety of forms  including repricing risk  yield curve risk  basis risk  and prepayment risk 
repricing risk exists when the change in the average yield of either interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities is more sensitive than the other to changes in market interest rates 
such a change in sensitivity could reflect a number of possible mismatches in the repricing opportunities of the company assets and liabilities 
yield curve risk reflects the possibility that the changes in the shape of the yield curve could have different effects on the company assets and liabilities 
basis risk exists when different parts of the balance sheet are subject to varying base rates reflecting the possibility that the spread from those base rates will deviate 
prepayment risk is associated with financial instruments with an option to prepay before the stated maturity often at a time of disadvantage to person selling the option  this risk is most often associated with the prepayment of loans  callable investments  and callable borrowings 
asset liability management market risk and interest rate risk management is governed by the company asset liability committee alco 
the alco establishes exposure limits that define the company tolerance for interest rate risk 
the asset liability committee and treasury group measure and manage the composition of the balance sheet over a range of possible changes in interest rates while remaining responsive to market demand for loan and deposit products 
the alco monitors current exposures versus limits and reports results to the board of directors 
the policy limits and guidelines serve as benchmarks for measuring interest rate risk and for providing a framework for evaluation and interest rate risk management decision making 
the company measures its interest rate risk by using an asset liability simulation model 
the model considers several factors to determine the company potential exposure to interest rate risk  including measurement of repricing gaps  duration  convexity  value at risk  and the market value of portfolio equity under assumed changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of yield curves  and general market volatility 
management controls the company interest rate exposure using several strategies  which include adjusting the maturities of securities in the company investment portfolio  limiting or expanding the terms of loans originated  limiting fixed rate deposits with terms of more than five years and adjusting maturities of fhlbb advances 
the company limits this risk by restricting the types of mbss it invests in to those with limited average life changes under certain interest rate shock scenarios  or securities with embedded prepayment penalties 
the company also places limits on holdings of fixed rate mortgage loans with maturities greater than five years 
the company also may use derivative instruments  principally interest rate swaps  to manage its interest rate risk  however  the company had no derivative fair value hedges or derivative cash flows at december  or see note  derivatives and hedging activities  to the consolidated financial statements 
measuring interest rate risk as noted above  interest rate risk can be measured by analyzing the extent to which the repricing of assets and liabilities are mismatched to create an interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period 

table of contents the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of falling interest rates  therefore  a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap position would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
the company interest rate risk position is measured using both income simulation and interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
income simulation is the primary tool for measuring the interest rate risk inherent in the company balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income  over a twelve month period  of a variety of interest rate shocks 
these simulations take into account repricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of individual products 
the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the exposure resulting from changes in market interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over a twelve month horizon  and develops appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
the company interest rate risk analysis remains modestly asset sensitive at december  as of december   net interest income simulation indicated that the company exposure to changing interest rates was within tolerance 
the alco reviews the methodology utilized for calculating interest rate risk exposure and may periodically adopt modifications to this methodology

debt securities include all debt securities 
unrealized gains and losses on securities  all other marketable equity securities and restricted equity securities are excluded 
for purposes of the gap analysis  the allowance for loan and lease losses  deferred loan origination costs and fair value adjustments are excluded 
interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
at december   interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year amounted to billion and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year amounted to billion  resulting in a cumulative one year negative gap position of million  or of total assets 
at december   the company had a cumulative one year negative gap position of 
table of contents million  or of total assets 
the change in the cumulative one year gap position from the end of was due primarily to the acquisition of bankri  which added longer term fhlb advances and the addition of incremental core deposits 
interest rates paid on now accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts are subject to change at any time and such deposits are immediately withdrawable 
a review of rates paid on these deposit categories over the last several years indicated that the amount and timing of rate changes did not coincide with the amount and timing of rate changes on other deposits when the frb adjusted its benchmark federal funds rate 
management views now and savings accounts to be less sensitive to interest rates than money market accounts and these accounts are therefore characterized as stable long term funding sensitive beyond five years 
management views money market accounts to be more volatile deposits and these accounts are therefore characterized as sensitive to changes in interest rates within the first year 
the company cumulative positive interest sensitivity gap of assets and liabilities with expected maturities of more than three years changed from million  or of total assets  at december  to million  or of total assets  at december  other market risks included in the company investment portfolio at december  were marketable equity securities with a market value of million 
that amount includes net unrealized gains of million 
movements in the market price of securities may affect the amount of gains or losses ultimately realized by the company from the sale of its equity securities 
the assumptions used in the company interest rate sensitivity simulation discussed above are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the simulations cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates
