as a provider of gifts to consumers and wholesalers for resale to consumers  the company is subject to changes in consumer confidence and the economic conditions that impact our customers 
demand for the company s products is affected by the financial health of our customers  which is influenced by macro economic issues such as unemployment  fuel and energy costs  weakness in the housing market and unavailability of consumer credit 
during the recent economic downturn  the demand for our products  and accordingly our financial results  compared to pre recessionary levels  has been adversely affected by the reduction in consumer spending 
during fiscal the company continued to recover from the effects of the recession which began in fiscal  
table of contents building on last year s improved financial performance 
as a result of cost reductions and productivity improvements  as well as marketing efficiency and merchandising innovation which has driven cost effective revenue growth  the company has been able to make significant annual improvements in ebitda compared to the low point of the recession during fiscal as stated in prior years  a key tenet of the company s strategy during this period was to stabilize the consumer floral operations and minimize business risk during the current recessionary period 
in order to improve earnings during this recessionary period  the company took a more conservative view of the economy  and its expectations of demand  in order to minimize the risk of investing marketing and operating spend for revenue growth too early in the economic recovery cycle 
this strategy was designed to protect earnings growth that was expected to be achieved through operational improvements and business resizing programs  including a rationalization of marketing spending  but driven by more effective campaigns  that focused on the company s ability to wow our customers with differentiated  non commoditized higher value products 
while the economic recovery continues at a slow pace  and the future of the recovery remains uncertain  the company believes that its sales bottomed out in the first half of fiscal  as it then began to experience modest year over year revenue growth 
recognizing the need to balance the company s short and long term operating and financial goals  the company s primary objective during fiscal is to continue to build on the revenue and earnings momentum generated over the past several years  while minimizing business risk during the uncertain economic environment 
tempered by the current economic climate  during fiscal  the company expects to achieve revenue growth across all three of its business segments with consolidated revenue growth for the year anticipated to be in the mid single digit range 
the company expects to grow ebitda and eps at rates in excess of expected revenue growth  reflecting anticipated continued improvements in gross profit margin and operating leverage 
the company s fiscal guidance is based on the positive trends both top and bottom line that the company has seen over the past three years  balanced by the continued uncertainty in the global economy 
the company plans to continue to focus on managing those aspects of the business where it can drive revenue growth and enhanced earnings results  including merchandising initiatives featuring truly original products and designs that have helped drive increased orders  average order value and gross profit margins  marketing programs that are designed to engage directly with our customers to deepen our relationships with them and help them deliver smiles  efforts in manufacturing  sourcing and shipping that have helped absorb rising commodity and fuel costs  combined with enhanced operating cost leverage  initiatives to improve the operational performance of our fannie may brand  and innovation for the future  including its industry leading efforts in social and mobile arenas  bloomnet  fruit bouquets and fannie may berries 
the company believes these efforts  and others underway  will help continue the positive trends seen in the business as the company deepens its relationships with its customers  helping them deliver smiles  and build shareholder value 

table of contents category information the following table presents the contribution of net revenues  gross profit and category contribution margin from each of the company s business segments  as well as consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
as noted previously  the company s wine fulfillment services business  as well as its e commerce and procurement businesses of the winetasting network  which had previously been included within its gourmet foods gift baskets category  has been classified as discontinued operations and therefore excluded from category information below

reconciliation of net income from continuing operations to adjusted ebitda from continuing operations corporate expenses consist of the company s enterprise shared service cost centers  and include  among other items  information technology  human resources  accounting and finance  legal  executive and customer service center functions  as well as stock based compensation 
in order to leverage the company s infrastructure  these functions are operated under a centralized management platform  providing support services throughout the organization 
the costs of these functions  other than those of the customer service center  which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage  are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific segment 
performance is measured based on segment contribution margin or segment adjusted ebitda  reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segment 
as such  management s measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead  described above  depreciation and amortization  other income net  nor does it include one time gains or charges 
management utilizes ebitda  and adjusted financial information  as a performance measurement tool because it considers such information a meaningful supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization 
the company also uses ebitda and adjusted financial information as one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
the company s credit agreement uses ebitda and adjusted financial information to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence 
ebitda and adjusted financial information is also used by the company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
ebitda and adjusted financial information have limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are a ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  the company s working capital needs  b ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on the company s debts  and c although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures 
because of these limitations  ebitda should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with gaap results when evaluating the company s performance

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of flowers 
com  inc  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory and long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenues are generated by e commerce operations from the company s online and telephonic sales channels as well as other operations retail wholesale and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise  service or outbound shipping charges  net of discounts  returns and credits 
net revenues are recognized primarily upon product shipment and do not include sales tax 
shipping terms are primarily fob shipping point 
net revenues generated by the company s bloomnet wire service operations include membership fees as well as other products and service offerings to florists 
membership fees are recognized monthly in the period earned  and products sales are recognized upon product shipment with shipping terms primarily fob shipping point 
initial franchise fees are recognized in income when the company has substantially performed or satisfied all material services or conditions relating to the sale of the franchise and the fees are nonrefundable 
area development fees are 
table of contents nonrefundable and are recognized in income on a pro rata basis when the conditions for revenue recognition under the individual area development agreements are met 
both initial franchise fees and area development fees are generally recognized upon the opening of a franchise store or upon termination of the agreement between the company and the franchisee 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or franchisees to make required payments 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  the company makes assumptions with respect to their future collectability 
the company s assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
once the company considers the factors above  an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on the company s experience in collecting these amounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method of accounting 
the company also records an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is determined by analyzing inventory skus based on age  expiration  historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales 
in addition  and as necessary  the company may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination  with the carrying value of the company s goodwill allocated to its reporting units 
goodwill is not amortized  but it is subject to an annual assessment for impairment  which the company performs during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each reporting unit regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
goodwill impairment testing involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparison of the fair value of each of the reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value  the second step must be performed to compute the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess 
the company generally estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using an equal weighting of the income and market approaches 
the company uses industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management and  in certain instances  the company engages third party valuation specialists for advice 
under the income approach  the company uses a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues  gross profit margins  operating income margins  working capital cash flow  perpetual growth rates  and long term discount rates  among others 
for the market approach  the company uses the guideline public company method 
under this method the company utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units  to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested  in order to obtain their respective fair values 
the company also reconciles the aggregate fair values of its reporting units determined in the first step as described above to its current market capitalization  allowing for a reasonable control premium 

table of contents based on the goodwill impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying value including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit 
future changes in the estimates and assumptions above could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of goodwill 
however  as a measure of sensitivity  a decrease in the fair value of the company s reporting units as of june   would have had no impact on the carrying value of the company s goodwill 
in addition  a decrease of basis points in our terminal perpetual growth rate or an increase of basis points in our weighted average cost of capital would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for each of our reporting units 
other intangibles and long lived assets other intangibles consist of definite lived intangible assets such as investment in licenses  customer lists  and others and indefinite lived intangible assets such as acquired trade names and trademarks 
the cost of definite lived intangible assets is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  on a straight line basis  over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from to years  while indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized 
long lived assets  such as definite lived intangibles and property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value  which is determined by discounting future cash flows 
the company tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually  during the fourth quarter  or whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  impairment is recognized for the difference 
to determine fair value of other indefinite lived intangible assets  the company uses an income approach  the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that  in lieu of ownership  a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset 
other indefinite lived intangible assets fair values require significant judgments in determining both the assets estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount and royalty rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value 
based on the indefinite lived intangible assets impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the estimated fair value of the company s intangibles significantly exceeded their respective carrying value 
future changes in the estimates and assumptions above could materially affect the results of our reviews for impairment of intangibles 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
the company has established deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the company recognizes as a deferred tax asset  the tax benefits associated with losses related to operations 
realization of these deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than a likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits utbs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances  such as significant amendments to existing tax law  new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new 
table of contents information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties  where appropriate  related to utbs in income tax expense 
assumptions  judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes 
newly adopted accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
testing goodwill for impairment asu no 
which is intended to reduce the complexity and costs to test goodwill for impairment 
the amendment allows an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the asu also expands upon the examples of events and circumstances that an entity should consider between annual impairment tests in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
this asu became effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for the company s fiscal year ending june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
the company adopted asu in its first quarter of fiscal year by including the required disclosures in two separate but consecutive statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu no 
 which allows entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu no 
permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test 
otherwise  the quantitative impairment test is not required 
asu no 
is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of the provisions of asu no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds and investment grade corporate and us government securities  as well as from outstanding debt 
as of june   the company had no debt outstanding under its credit agreement  as all amounts previously outstanding were paid off during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes  but rather  on occasion  to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the company has managed its floating rate debt using interest rate swaps in order to reduce its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
in july  the company entered into a million notional amount swap agreement that exchanges a variable interest rate libor for a fixed rate of interest over the term of the agreement 
this swap matured on july  the company had designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of the interest rate risk attributable to forecasted variable interest libor payments 
the effective portion of the after tax fair value gains or losses on this swap was included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
