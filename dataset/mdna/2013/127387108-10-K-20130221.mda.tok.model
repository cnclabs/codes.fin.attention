item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k and with part i  item a  risk factors 
please refer to the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form k regarding forward looking statements 
business overview we develop eda software  hardware and ip 
we license software and ip  sell or lease hardware technology  provide maintenance for our offerings and provide engineering and education services to help manage and accelerate product development processes for semiconductor and electronics systems companies 
our customers use our products and services to design and develop complex ics and electronics systems 
substantially all of our revenue is generated from semiconductor and electronics systems manufacturers and designers and is dependent upon their commencement of new design projects 
as a result  our revenue is significantly influenced by our customers business outlook and investment in the introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products 

table of contents we have identified certain items that management uses as performance indicators to manage our business  including revenue  certain elements of operating expenses and cash flow from operations  and we describe these items further below under the heading results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income loss and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
at least quarterly  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates  and make changes as deemed necessary 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for income taxes  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  business combinations  intangible asset and goodwill impairments and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
for information on our significant accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method 
we also apply a two step approach to determine the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will take on tax returns before actually preparing and filing the tax returns 
changes in our business  tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  and developments in current and future tax audits  could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this judgment  we must make predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and weigh all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income 
we give greater weight to evidence that can be objectively verified 
for the year ended december   we judged that our history of operating profits in the united states  and our expectations of future profits  considering our software ratable revenue recognition model and ending backlog of revenue as of december  were sufficient positive evidence to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance against our united states deferred tax assets 
however  if in the future  we determine that we no longer meet the realization threshold for some or all of our deferred tax assets then we would need to establish a valuation allowance that could result in a material provision for income taxes in the period such determination is made 
for an additional description of the valuation allowance  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we only recognize the tax benefit of an income tax position if we judge that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained  solely on its technical merits  in a tax audit including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
to make this judgment  we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws  regulations and administrative practices 
if we judge that an income tax position meets this recognition threshold  then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by estimating the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than cumulative probability of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes 
to determine when a tax position is effectively settled  we must estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would re review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed 
we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the months after each fiscal year end 
these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements or for other reasons 
in addition  we are required by the irs to disclose uncertain tax positions taken on our federal tax returns 
we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
for the year ended december   we made the judgment that we had effectively settled certain tax positions related to the state of california franchise tax board  or the ftb  examination of our california tax returns for the through tax years that resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit 
for additional descriptions of our effective settlements  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we begin to recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement  and collectibility of the fee is probable 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of whether the facts and circumstances of an arrangement support that the fee for the arrangement is considered to be fixed or determinable and that collectibility of the fee is probable  and these judgments can affect the amount of revenue that we recognize in a particular reporting period 
we must also make these judgments when assessing whether a contract amendment to a term arrangement primarily in the context of a license extension or renewal constitutes a concession 
our experience has been that we are able to determine whether a fee is fixed or determinable  and we have established a history of collecting under contracts for which the fee has been assessed as fixed or determinable without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
for installment contracts that do not include a substantial up front payment  we consider that a fee is fixed or determinable only if the arrangement has payment periods that are equal to or less than the term of the licenses and the payments are collected in equal or nearly equal installments  when evaluated over the entire term of the arrangement 
while we do not expect our experience to change  if we no longer were to have a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on term licenses  revenue from term licenses would be required to be recognized when payments under the installment contract become due and payable 
such a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
generally  we are able to estimate whether collection is probable  but significant judgment is applied as we assess the creditworthiness of our customers to make this determination 
if our experience were to change  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we do not record revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
in general  revenue for product and maintenance associated with term and subscription licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the license  commencing upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the first software product 
the allocation of revenue to maintenance is based on a percentage of the total contract value  as determined by the length of the contract 
in general  product revenue associated with term and perpetual licenses where vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  exists for the undelivered maintenance is recognized up front  upon the later of the effective date of the arrangement or delivery of the software product  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met  and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
a relatively small percentage of our revenue from software licenses is recognized on an up front basis 
sale of our hardware products generally involves the following deliverables the hardware product and its related essential software  and maintenance for the hardware and the software 
consideration allocated to the hardware product and the essential 
table of contents software is recognized as revenue at the time of delivery  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
consideration allocated to the maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term 
revenue from services contracts is recognized either on the time and materials method  as work is performed  or on the percentage of completion method 
if a service contract is considered to be part of a multiple element arrangement  or mea  that includes a software contract  revenue is generally recognized ratably over the duration of the software contract 
for contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees  we estimate on a monthly basis the percentage of completion based on the completion of milestones relating to the arrangement 
we have a history of accurately estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances  and specification and testing requirement changes 
if different conditions were to prevail such that accurate estimates could not be made  then the use of the completed contract method would be required and the recognition of all revenue and costs would be deferred until the project was completed 
such a change could have a material impact on our results of operations 
if a group of contracts is so closely related that they are  in effect  part of a single arrangement  such arrangements are deemed to be an mea 
we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the separate contracts should be accounted for individually as distinct arrangements or whether the separate contracts are  in substance  an mea 
our judgments about whether a group of contracts is an mea can affect the timing of revenue recognition under those contracts  which could have an effect on our results of operations for the periods involved 
for example  a term or perpetual license agreement that would otherwise result in up front revenue upon delivery may be deemed part of an mea when it is executed within close proximity  or in contemplation of  other license agreements that require ratable revenue recognition with the same customer  in which event all the revenue is recognized over the longest term of any component of the mea instead of up front 
for an mea that includes software and nonsoftware elements  we allocate consideration to all software elements as a group and all nonsoftware elements based on their relative standalone selling prices 
revenue allocated to each deliverable is then recognized when all four criteria are met 
in these circumstances  there is a hierarchy to determine the standalone selling price to be used for allocating consideration to the deliverables as follows vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  third party evidence of selling price  or tpe  and best estimate of the selling price  or besp 
we calculate the besp of our hardware products based on our pricing practices  including the historical average prices charged for comparable hardware products  because vsoe or tpe cannot be established 
our process for determining besp for our software deliverables without vsoe or tpe takes into account multiple factors that vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
key external and internal factors considered in developing the besps include prices charged by us for similar arrangements  historical pricing practices and the nature of the product 
in addition  when developing besps  we may consider other factors as appropriate  including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist  and product specific business objectives 
we exercise significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in calculating the besp of the deliverables in our arrangements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
this allowance is based on our assessment of the creditworthiness of our customers  historical experience and the overall economic climate of the industries that we serve 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  we continue to monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions  which may result in changes to our estimates regarding our ability to collect from our customers 
changes in circumstances  such as an unexpected change in a customer ability to meet its financial obligation to us or a customer payment trends  or a downward trend in the volume of business in the semiconductor sector  are hard to predict and may require us to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us 
these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents business combinations when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to acquired tangible assets and liabilities  including deferred revenue  liabilities associated with the fair value of contingent consideration and acquired identifiable intangible assets 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires us to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities  especially with respect to intangible assets and goodwill 
these estimates are based on information obtained from management of the acquired companies  our assessment of this information  and historical experience 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an acquired business is expected to generate in the future  the cash flows that specific assets acquired with that business are expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable  and if different estimates were used  the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made to the acquired assets and liabilities 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates  and if such events occur  we may be required to adjust the value allocated to acquired assets or assumed liabilities 
we also make significant judgments and estimates when we assign useful lives to the definite lived intangible assets identified as part of our acquisitions 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and if we used different estimates  the useful life over which we amortize intangible assets would be different 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may impact the useful life over which we amortize our intangible assets  which would impact our amortization of intangible assets expense and our results of operations 
intangible asset and goodwill impairments we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including certain intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover an asset group carrying amount 
recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group  excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances  forecasting future operating results  and estimating the proceeds  if any  from the disposition of long lived or intangible asset group 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated and if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered to be impaired and a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal and determined that the fair value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount of our net assets and that no impairment existed 
fair value of financial instruments on a quarterly basis  we measure at fair value certain financial assets and liabilities  including the hedge and embedded conversion derivative associated with the cash convertible senior notes due inputs to valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets  and level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 

table of contents this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data  if available  when determining fair value 
we recognize transfers between levels of this hierarchy based on the fair values of the respective financial instruments at the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred 
the types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active  but are valued based on quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency  are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
certain instruments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency 
for those instruments that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  our best estimate is used 
while we believe the observable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in level and the unobservable inputs we use to measure the assets and liabilities included in level are reasonable  different inputs or estimates may materially impact the resulting fair value measurements of these instruments and may also impact our results of operations 
for an additional description of our fair value measurements see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations financial results for fiscal  as compared to fiscal and fiscal  reflect the following an increase in the aggregate amount of our product and maintenance revenue  primarily because of a general increase in the annualized values of software contracts with our customers and an increase in the sale and lease of our hardware products  an increase in the cost of hardware products sold  primarily during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  driven by increases in the sale and lease of our hardware products  an increase in employee related costs  primarily consisting of costs related to hiring additional employees during fiscal and incremental costs related to employees added from our acquisition of sigrity  inc  or sigrity  during fiscal and employees added from our fiscal acquisitions  an increase in variable compensation due to increased revenue  bookings and operating performance  net recoveries of amounts in our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during fiscal and  to a lesser extent  fiscal  from collection of certain receivables that had previously been reserved  the agreements we reached in february to settle our derivative and securities litigation and the associated million litigation charge we recorded during fiscal  and benefits for income taxes in fiscal and related to the following during fiscal  the release of the valuation allowance for a significant portion of our united states deferred tax assets based on our determination that it is more likely than not that we will realize these deferred tax assets in future periods and from the effective settlement of the california franchise tax board  or ftb  examination of our tax returns for the through tax years  and during fiscal  the effective settlement of the irs examination of our federal income tax returns for the tax years through and the release of valuation allowance for our united states deferred tax assets that resulted from the increase in deferred tax liabilities from the intangible assets acquired with denali during fiscal revenue we primarily generate revenue from licensing our eda software and ip  selling or leasing our hardware technology  providing maintenance for our software  ip and hardware and providing engineering services 
the timing of our product revenue is significantly affected by the mix of hardware and software products in the bookings executed in any given period and whether the revenue for such bookings is recognized over multiple periods or up front  upon completion of delivery 

table of contents we seek to achieve a consistent mix of bookings with approximately of the aggregate value of our bookings of a type for which the revenue is recurring  or ratable  in nature  and the remainder of the resulting revenue recognized up front  upon completion of delivery 
our ability to achieve this bookings mix in any single fiscal quarter may be impacted by an increase in hardware sales beyond our current expectations  because product revenue for hardware sales is generally recognized up front in the quarter in which delivery is completed 
approximately of the aggregate value of our bookings during fiscal  and was of a type for which the revenue is recurring  or ratable  in nature 
we believe our reported revenue and the amount of revenue recognized in future periods will depend on  among other things  the competitiveness of our new technology  and size  duration  timing  terms and type of contract renewals with existing customers  additional sales to existing customers  and sales to new customers 
revenue mix we analyze our software  vip and design ip and hardware businesses by product group  combining revenues for both product and maintenance because of their interrelationship 
we have formulated a design solution strategy that combines our design technologies into categories  as described in the various product groups below functional verification  hardware and ip products in this group  including the incisive functional verification platform are used to verify that the high level  logical representation of an ic design is functionally correct  and for verification at the system and soc levels 
our emulation hardware products  vip products  memory sub system models  and design ip products are also included in this product group 
custom ic design our custom design products  including the virtuoso custom design platform  are used to create ics that must be designed at the transistor level  including analog  rf  memory  high performance digital blocks and standard cell libraries 
included in this group are specialized verification products that simulate the operation of the design prior to manufacturing 
the final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the ic 
digital ic design products in this group  including the encounter digital ic design platform  are used to create and convert the high level  logical representation of a digital ic into a detailed physical blueprint  and ultimately  produce the detailed design information describing how the ic will be manufactured 
the final product of the design flow is a file that describes the various photomasks which are used to manufacture the ic 
system interconnect design this product group consists of our pcb and ic package design products  including the allegro and orcad products 
the allegro system interconnect design platform enables consistent co design of interconnects across ics  ic packages and pcbs  while the orcad line focuses on cost effective  entry level pcb solutions 
the sigrity signal and power integrity products we acquired during fiscal are included in this product group 
design for manufacturing included in the dfm product group are our physical verification  manufacturing optimization  and layout analysis products 
these products are used to analyze  optimize  and verify that the physical blueprint of the ic has been constructed correctly and can be manufactured successfully 
while our primary focus in dfm is to address manufacturing effects in the upstream digital and custom design flows  those products included in this dfm category also are offered separately from our other tools 
for an additional description of our current product strategy  see the discussion under the heading products and product strategy under part i  item  business 

table of contents revenue by year the following table shows our revenue for fiscal  and and the change in revenue between years change vs 
vs 
in millions  except percentages product services maintenance total revenue for software arrangements  we generally recognize revenue ratably over the duration of the arrangement and such revenue is allocated between product and maintenance revenue 
as the duration decreases  the percentage of the total contract value that is allocated to maintenance revenue decreases and the percentage allocated to product revenue increases 
combined  product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily because of increased business levels  an increase in revenue related to the sale and lease of our hardware products and increased revenue recognized from bookings in prior periods 
maintenance revenue decreased on a standalone basis during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily because of the increased allocation to product revenue due to the gradual decline in the average duration of our time based software license arrangements over the last three years 
product and maintenance revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to reasons noted above and also due to the increase in revenue from the denali business which we acquired in the second quarter of we expect the aggregate of product and maintenance revenue will increase during fiscal due to increases in the revenue from our software and ip products  partially offset by an expected decrease in revenue from our hardware products 
services revenue decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily because certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects and to assist with pre sales activities 
services revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily because of cash collections from customers on orders fulfilled in years prior to for which revenue was recognized in fiscal upon receipt of cash payment  and because of higher utilization rates for our services personnel 
we expect services revenue to decrease during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as we expect certain of our design services engineers will continue to work on internal research and development projects  primarily related or our design ip and vip activities 
revenue by product group the following table shows the percentage of product and related maintenance revenue contributed by each of our five product groups  and services and other during fiscal  and functional verification  hardware and ip custom ic design digital ic design system interconnect design design for manufacturing services and other total as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  certain of our licensing arrangements allow customers the ability to remix among software products 
additionally  we have arrangements with customers that include a combination of our products  with the actual product selection and number of licensed users to be determined at a later date 
for these arrangements  
table of contents we estimate the allocation of the revenue to product groups based upon the expected usage of our products 
the actual usage of our products by these customers may differ and  if that proves to be the case  the revenue allocation in the table above would differ 
the changes in the percentage of revenue contributed by the functional verification  hardware and ip product group are generally related to changes in revenue related to our hardware products 
revenue by geography change vs

revenue by geography as a percent of total revenue united states other americas europe  middle east and africa japan asia total no one customer accounted for or more of total revenue during fiscal  or most of our revenue is transacted in the united states dollar 
however  certain revenue transactions are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  and we recognize additional revenue from those contracts in periods when the united states dollar weakens in value against the japanese yen and reduced revenue from those contracts in periods when the united states dollar strengthens against the japanese yen

table of contents the following table shows cost of revenue as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal  and product services maintenance cost of product cost of product includes costs associated with the sale and lease of our hardware and licensing of our software and ip products 
cost of product associated with our hardware products includes materials  assembly and overhead 
these additional hardware manufacturing costs make our cost of hardware product higher  as a percentage of revenue  than our cost of software and ip products 
cost of product also includes the cost of employee salary  benefits and other employee related costs  including stock based compensation expense  amortization of acquired intangibles directly related to our products  as well as the costs of technical documentation and royalties payable to third party vendors

amortization of acquired intangibles included in cost of product increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of sigrity during fiscal  our fiscal acquisitions and our acquisition of denali during fiscal cost of product depends primarily upon the mix of hardware and software product sales in any given period  and also depends upon the timing and extent to which we acquire intangible assets  acquire or license third parties intellectual property or technology and sell our products that include such acquired or licensed intellectual property or technology 
for an additional description of our expected amortization of intangible assets  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of services cost of services primarily includes employee salary  benefits and other employee related costs  costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to manage a services organization  and provisions for contract losses  if any 
cost of services decreased by million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in employee salary  benefits and other employee related costs 
certain of our design services engineers have been redeployed to internal research and development projects or to assist with pre sales activities  resulting in lower cost of services expense 
we expect to continue to deploy our services engineers on internal projects and pre sales activities 
there were no significant changes in cost of services during fiscal  as compared to fiscal 
table of contents cost of maintenance cost of maintenance includes the cost of our customer support services  such as telephone  online and on site support  employee salary  benefits and other employee related costs  amortization of acquired intangible assets and documentation of maintenance updates 
there were no significant changes in cost of maintenance during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and during fiscal  as compared to fiscal operating expenses our operating expenses include marketing and sales  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
factors that may cause our operating expenses to fluctuate include changes in the number of employees due to hiring  acquisitions  foreign exchange rates and the impact of our variable compensation programs  which are driven by overall operating results 
our employee salary and other compensation related costs increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to hiring additional employees for our research and development activities  the addition of employees from our acquisitions and higher variable compensation resulting from improved business levels 
we expect our operating expenses to increase during fiscal  as compared to fiscal primarily due to expected hiring of research and development and sales personnel during fiscal  the addition of employees in these areas throughout fiscal and from our acquisition of sigrity 
our operating expenses are denominated in various foreign currencies 
we recognize lower expenses in periods when the united states dollar strengthens in value against other currencies and we recognize higher expenses when the united states dollar weakens against other currencies

these recoveries resulted in reductions in our general and administrative expense during fiscal and fiscal and  as a result  our general and administrative expense increased for fiscal and fiscal we had previously recorded reserves for certain customers based on changes in our assessment of collectibility for those customers 
the principal factor for the assessment at that time was a general deterioration of economic conditions having a significant impact on certain customers 
these customers business prospects eventually improved  and we were able to collect the majority of those receivables that had previously been reserved  resulting in recoveries of previously reserved bad debts 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is recorded within the various components of our costs and expenses 
stock based compensation expense increased million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  because of an increase in restricted stock outstanding and higher grant date fair values 
stock based compensation did not change significantly during fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect stock based compensation to increase during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  because we expect that new awards granted during fiscal will have higher grant date fair values compared to grants made in previous years

table of contents restructuring and other charges we have initiated various restructuring plans in the past  with the most recent taking place during fiscal for an additional description of these restructuring plans  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
because the restructuring charges and related benefits are derived from management estimates made during the formulation of the restructuring plans  based on then currently available information  our restructuring plans may not achieve the benefits anticipated on the timetable or at the level contemplated 
demand for our products and services and  ultimately  our future financial performance  is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty 
accordingly  additional actions  including further restructuring of our operations  may be required in the future 
the following table presents restructuring and other charges for our restructuring plans severance and benefits excess facilities other total in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal restructuring and other charges recorded during fiscal consisted primarily of costs for severance and termination benefits related to our restructuring plans 
restructuring and other charges credits recorded during fiscal and consisted primarily of adjustments to previous estimates of restructuring liabilities

table of contents our benefit for income taxes for fiscal primarily consisted of the following tax benefit from the release of year end valuation allowance of million against our united states deferred tax assets  tax benefit of million from the effective settlement of the state of california ftb examination of our tax returns from through tax benefit from the release of million of valuation allowance against our united states deferred tax assets due to the acquisition of intangible assets held by sigrity during fiscal  partially offset by  tax expense related to certain of our foreign subsidiaries  and excess tax benefit from employee stock compensation that was allocated to equity 
our release of the valuation allowance was based on our determination that the magnitude and history of our united states income  our achievement of a consistent multi year history with approximately of the aggregate value of our bookings being of a type for which revenue is recurring  or ratable  in nature  and our ending backlog of future revenue for the year ended december  provided us an objective source of future revenues that allowed us to more heavily weigh our projections of future income and collectively provided us with sufficient positive evidence that it is more likely than not that we will realize a significant amount of our united states deferred tax assets 
we maintained a valuation allowance of million on certain of our deferred tax assets because the realization of these deferred tax assets require future income of a specific character or amount that we considered uncertain 
our fiscal provision for income taxes is primarily related to million of tax expense on certain of our foreign subsidiaries  million of excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation that were allocated to stockholders equity  and million of interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits that was partially offset by million of tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities resulting from a fiscal business combination 
our fiscal benefit for income taxes is primarily related to the decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest of million as a result of our effective settlement of certain tax matters with the irs in august and the release of million of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets primarily due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities related to the acquisition of intangibles with denali in june the american taxpayer relief act of  enacted in january  retroactively extended the united states federal research tax credit from january  through december  we expect to recognize a period specific tax benefit of approximately million for the fiscal federal research tax credit during our first quarter of fiscal we may also recognize an additional period specific tax benefit of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal related to uncertain tax positions recorded in a prior business combination

in millions cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net working capital cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as compared to million as of december  during fiscal  we began to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately million in marketable debt securities  including corporate debt securities  united states treasury securities  united states government agency securities  bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper 
our investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale and are included in short term investments as of december  our investments are made in accordance with our cash investment policy  
table of contents which governs the amounts and types of investments we hold in our portfolio 
our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties including credit risk  interest rate risk and general market risk  as outlined in part i  item a  risk factors 
our primary source of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during fiscal and was customer payments for products  maintenance and services 
we also received cash from stock purchases under our espp and from the exercise of stock options 
our primary use of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during fiscal and was payments relating to salaries  benefits  other employee related costs and other operating expenses 
during fiscal and we used cash for our acquisitions  including our acquisition of sigrity during fiscal  and to purchase property  plant and equipment 
during fiscal  we also used cash to pay the remaining balance on our notes  and to pay amounts related to the settlement of our securities and derivative litigation 
approximately of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december  our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from certain foreign operations 
we do not anticipate we will need to repatriate dividends from foreign operations that are permanently reinvested in order to fund our domestic operations 
in the event that dividends from foreign operations that are currently permanently reinvested are needed to fund united states liquidity  we could be required to accrue and pay additional taxes in order to repatriate these funds 
for further discussion regarding our income taxes  including the unrecognized tax liability for indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on december   we entered into a million five year senior secured revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility may be used to finance working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other business purposes 
any outstanding loans drawn under the credit facility are payable on or before december  the credit facility contains customary negative covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  grant liens  make certain investments  dispose of certain assets and make certain payments 
in addition  the credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio of not greater than to  subject to certain exceptions  and requires that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least to for an additional description of this revolving credit facility see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility 
we expect that current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  cash flows that are generated from operations  and cash available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital  other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
net working capital the changes in net working capital were due to the following change vs 
vs 
in millions increase in cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in short term investments increase decrease in prepaid expenses and other decrease increase in current portion of deferred revenue increase decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities decrease increase in inventories decrease in receivables  net increase in current portion of convertible notes other individually insignificant items the increase in prepaid expenses and other is primarily due to increases in prepaid income taxes 
the increase in the current portion of convertible notes is due to the shift of the convertible notes  which mature in december  from a long term 
table of contents liability to a current liability 
the decrease in deferred revenue and the decrease in accounts receivable result from closer alignment between the timing of our revenue and cash collections and collections of accounts receivable during fiscal our notes are convertible into cash from december  through march  because our closing stock price exceeded for at least of the last trading days prior to december  accordingly  the net balance of the notes of million is classified as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the notes were convertible and therefore classified as a current liability as of december  and december   whereas they were classified as long term as of january  because the stock price conversion condition had not been met in the fourth quarter of fiscal the classification of the notes as a current or long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet is evaluated at each balance sheet date and may change from time to time  depending on whether the stock price conversion condition  as described above  has been met in a particular fiscal quarter 
if the note holders elect to convert their notes prior to maturity  any unamortized discount and transaction fees will be expensed at the time of conversion 
if the entire outstanding principal amount had been converted on december  we would have recorded an expense of million associated with the conversion  comprised of million of unamortized debt discount and million of unamortized transaction fees 
the classification of the liability associated with the cash conversion feature of the notes  or the notes embedded conversion derivative  and the notes hedges asset as current or long term on our consolidated balance sheet corresponds with the classification of the notes 
as such  we classified the fair value of the notes embedded conversion derivative as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december  we also classified the fair value of the notes hedges as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december  the value of the notes embedded conversion derivative liability and the value of the notes hedges asset offset one another and the changes in the fair value of these instruments resulted in no net change to our net working capital as of december  and december  if the holders of our notes elect to convert their notes into cash  we would be required to make cash payments of up to million prior to the maturity of the notes 
in connection with the notes  we entered into the notes hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the notes 
the notes currently trade at a premium to their if converted value  and we do not anticipate a conversion of the notes by the note holders between december  and march  however  if the holders of the notes elect to convert their notes between december  and march  we expect to have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and access to our revolving credit facility to fund any payment resulting from a conversion

our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by business levels and the payment terms set forth in our license agreements 
if our customers experience adverse changes in the future  are not successful in generating sufficient cash or are precluded from securing financing  they may delay purchasing our products and services  or they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us  although these obligations are generally not cancelable 
our customers inability to fulfill payment obligations would adversely affect our cash flow 
additionally  our customers may seek to renegotiate pre existing contractual commitments 
though we have not experienced a material level of defaults  any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows from operations 
in february  all parties to our securities and derivative litigation agreed to settle the litigation 
during fiscal  we paid million into a securities litigation settlement fund  which amount included our portion of the settlement consideration plus accrued interest 
as of december   we had paid  and our insurance carriers had paid  all amounts specified by the settlement agreement into the securities litigation settlement fund 
the settlement was approved during fiscal we expect to pay an additional million related to our previous restructuring activities  primarily for payments related to vacated facilities  net of expected sublease income 
we expect that cash flows from operating activities will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors  including our operating results and the timing of our billings  collections and tax payments

on july  we acquired sigrity for total cash consideration of million net of cash acquired of million of which million was paid at closing  and million was deferred and is conditioned upon certain sigrity shareholders remaining employees of cadence over designated retention periods 
we recorded expense of million during fiscal related to this deferred purchase consideration and will expense the remaining million over the remaining retention periods and we include these deferred payments as a use of cash for operating activities in the period we make the payments 
during fiscal  we recorded cash used for investing activities of million related to the sigrity acquisition

in connection with our business combinations and asset acquisitions completed before december   we may be obligated to make payments based on  or subject to the satisfaction of  certain performance metrics 
if performance is such that these payments are fully achieved  we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million in cash during the next months 
during fiscal  we expect to use cash for our purchase of cosmic circuits private limited

during fiscal  we issued million principal amount of the notes 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we entered into the notes hedges to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount that may become due to the holders of the notes 
in separate transactions  we also sold warrants  or the warrants  to purchase our common stock at a strike price of per share 
we used an aggregate of million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes to purchase in the open market million principal amount of our notes and million principal amount of our notes  and we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
in a separate transaction during fiscal  we repurchased in the open market million principal amount of our notes 
for an additional description of our notes  notes and notes  and the conversion terms thereof  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and net working capital  above 
during fiscal we expect to pay the million remaining principal balance on our notes upon maturity in december the increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock during fiscal  as compared to and in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  resulted from an increase in employee participation in our espp  an increase in the exercise of stock options and an increase in our stock price 
other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had convertible notes outstanding with a net liability value of million and that mature between december   and june  the principal maturity value of these convertible notes is million 
the total cash or stock payable upon the early conversion of these notes  as determined by the indenture of each security  will be their principal amount plus any additional conversion value that would be due upon conversion 
in the case of our notes  we will owe additional cash to the note holders upon early conversion if our stock price exceeds per share 
we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the principal amount of the notes that may be due to the holders upon conversion 
in separate transactions  we sold warrants  or the warrants  with a strike price of per share 
although our incremental cash payout exposure above the conversion price is limited by the hedges to the million outstanding principal value of the notes  we will experience dilution to our stock and to our diluted earnings per share from the outstanding warrants to the extent our average closing stock price exceeds in any fiscal quarter until the notes are converted and the warrants are settled 

table of contents additionally  holders may convert their notes into cash during any quarter following a quarter in which our stock price closes above for at least of the last trading days 
while holders of the notes would have the right to convert their notes if early conversion conditions are met  we do not expect holders of the notes to convert their notes under such circumstances because the economic value to the holders of the notes has exceeded and likely will continue to exceed the cash received upon conversion 
if the holders of the notes elect to convert their notes between december  and march   we expect to have sufficient cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and access to our revolving credit facility to fund any payment resulting from a conversion 
however  if holders of a significant portion of the notes were to choose to convert at a time in which the notes are convertible  it could have a significant negative impact on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and liquidity 
in the case of our notes  we may owe shares of our common stock to the note holders upon conversion if our stock price exceeds per share 
we entered into hedges with counterparties to limit our exposure to the dilution that may result from the issuance of shares upon conversion of the notes 
in separate transactions  we sold warrants with a strike price of per share 
we will experience dilution to our stock and to diluted earnings per share from the outstanding warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds 
we expect to fund the maturity of the notes in december with our cash on hand and cash flows from operating activities during fiscal the notes could become convertible prior to their maturity if certain conversion conditions are met 
however  we do not currently expect any of the conversion conditions to be met prior to the maturity of the notes 
we also believe that we will have sufficient cash in future periods as well as access to our revolving credit facility to service the maturities of our notes  but future changes in our cash position  cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  cash flows from financing activities  as well as general business levels and changes in our access to financing may impact our ability to settle the principal amount payable to the holders of the notes and notes when they mature or convert

table of contents contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations notes notes notes contractual interest payments current income tax payable and unrecognized tax benefits other long term contractual obligations total with respect to purchase obligations that are cancelable by us  the table includes the amount that would have been payable if we had canceled the obligation as of december  or the earliest cancellation date 
the notes are due in august however  the holders of the notes can require us to repurchase for cash the remaining portion of the notes on august  for of the principal amount 
therefore  we have included million of principal of the notes on the potential repurchase of the notes in the less than year column in the table above 
holders of the notes can convert their notes into cash during a fiscal quarter if the closing price of our common stock exceeds for at least days in the day period preceding the end of the preceding fiscal quarter 
this conversion condition was met for the notes during the three months ended december   and the notes are convertible into cash from december  through march  accordingly  we classified the net balance of the notes of million as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in connection with the notes  we entered into the notes hedges and sold warrants to limit our exposure to the additional cash payments above the million principal balance in the event of a cash conversion of the notes 
the notes currently trade at a premium to their if converted value  so we do not anticipate a conversion of the notes by the note holders between december  and march  included in other long term contractual obligations are long term income tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of million that we estimate will be paid or settled within to years 
included in this amount are million of uncertain tax benefits recorded in a prior business combination for which the statute of limitation may expire in the first quarter of fiscal the remaining portion of other long term contractual obligations is primarily liabilities associated with defined benefit retirement plans and acquisition related liabilities 
in connection with our acquisitions completed before december   we would be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million in cash over the next months if certain defined performance goals are achieved in full 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting standards regarding the presentation of comprehensive income loss in the financial statements 
the new standards require presentation of the components of net income loss  the components of other comprehensive income loss  and total comprehensive income loss  either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
these standards eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
these standards were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and were to be applied retrospectively 
we adopted these standards as of january  and disclosed components of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
the adoption of this guidance affected only the presentation of our financial statements and had no impact on our consolidated operating results and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued new accounting standards that allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
these standards were effective for annual periods beginning after december  we adopted these standards as of january  and they did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review new accounting standards 
although some of the accounting standards that have been issued may be applicable to us  we have not identified any other new accounting standards that would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a material portion of our revenue  expenses and business activity are transacted in the united states dollar 
however  certain of our operations include transactions in foreign currencies that can affect our results of operations 
in certain countries where we invoice customers in the local currency  japan in particular  our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar 
the opposite impact occurs in countries where we record expenses in local currencies 
in those cases  our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar 
most of our revenue is transacted in united states dollars 
the fluctuations in our operating expenses outside the united states resulting from volatility in the united states dollar against certain foreign currencies are not generally moderated by corresponding fluctuations in our revenues  except for our operations in japan 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts with financial institutions to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities 
a foreign currency forward exchange contract acts as a hedge by increasing in value when underlying assets decrease in value or underlying liabilities increase in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
conversely  a foreign currency forward exchange contract decreases in value when underlying assets increase in value or underlying liabilities decrease in value due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these forward contracts are not designated as accounting hedges  so the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other income  net  in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows with the fair value of these forward contracts being recorded as accrued liabilities or other current assets 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
our forward contracts generally have maturities of days or less 
we enter into currency forward exchange contracts based on estimated future asset and liability exposures  and the effectiveness of our hedging program depends on our ability to estimate these future asset and liability exposures 
recognized gains and losses with respect to our current hedging activities will ultimately depend on how accurately we are able to match the amount of currency forward exchange contracts with actual underlying asset and liability exposures 

table of contents the following table provides information about our forward foreign currency contracts as of december  the information is provided in united states dollar equivalent amounts 
the table presents the notional amounts  at contract exchange rates  and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates expressed as units of the foreign currency per united states dollar  which in some cases may not be the market convention for quoting a particular currency 
all of these forward contracts mature before or during february notional principal weighted average contract rate in millions forward contracts japanese yen european union euro indian rupee canadian dollar chinese renminbi israeli shekel other n a total estimated fair value while we actively monitor our foreign currency risks  there can be no assurance that our foreign currency hedging activities will substantially offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our portfolio of marketable debt securities  our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and outstanding balances drawn on our credit facility  if any 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world leading industrialized countries  but the fair value of our marketable debt securities and our interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of united states interest rates 
in this regard  changes in united states interest rates affect the interest earned on our marketable debt securities and cash and cash equivalents  any unrealized and realized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities and the costs associated with foreign currency hedges 
pursuant to our investment policy  we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer  other than in securities issued by the united states treasury and united states government agencies 
our short term investments as of december  include million of marketable debt securities that may decline in value if market interest rates rise 
such variability in market interest rates may result in a negative impact on the results of our investment activities 
as of december   an increase in the market rates of interest of would result in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable debt securities by approximately million 
all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
securities with maturities greater than three months are classified as available for sale and are considered to be short term investments 
the carrying value of our interest bearing instruments approximated fair value as of december  interest rates under our revolving credit facility are variable  so interest expense for periods when the credit facility is utilized could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
interest rates under our revolving credit facility can fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates and in an interest rate margin that varies based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of our credit facility 
equity price risk convertible notes our notes and notes include conversion and settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock at conversion or at maturity of the notes 
in addition  the hedges and warrants associated with these convertible notes also include settlement provisions that are based on the price of our common stock 
the amount of cash we may be required to pay  
table of contents or the number of shares we may be required to provide to note holders at conversion or maturity of these notes  is determined by the price of our common stock 
the amount of cash or number of shares that we may receive from hedge counterparties in connection with the related hedges and the number of shares that we may be required to provide warrant counterparties in connection with the related warrants are also determined by the price of our common stock 
upon the expiration of our warrants  cadence will issue shares of common stock to the purchasers of the warrants to the extent our stock price exceeds the warrant strike price of at that time 
the following table shows the number of shares that cadence would issue to warrant counterparties at expiration of the warrants  assuming various cadence closing stock prices on the dates of warrant expiration shares in millions prior to the expiration of the warrants  for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share  our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will increase when our average closing stock price for a quarter exceeds 
for an additional description of our notes and notes  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources  under item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
equity investments we have a portfolio of equity investments that includes marketable equity securities and non marketable investments 
our equity investments are made primarily in connection with our strategic investment program 
under our strategic investment program  from time to time  we make cash investments in companies with technologies that are potentially strategically important to us 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an additional description of these investments 
our non marketable investments had a carrying value of million as of december   and million as of december
