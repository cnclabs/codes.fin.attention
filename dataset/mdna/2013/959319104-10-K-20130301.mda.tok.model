company overview we are an independent crude oil refiner and marketer of refined products and also operate retail stores that sell various grades of gasoline  diesel fuel  and convenience store merchandise 
we own and operate two refineries with a total crude oil throughput capacity of  barrels per day bpd 
in addition to our  bpd refinery in el paso  texas  we own and operate a refinery near gallup  new mexico  with a throughput capacity of  bpd 
in september  we temporarily suspended refining operations of a  bpd refinery on the east coast of the united states near yorktown  virginia 
between september and december   we operated a stand alone refined product distribution terminal at yorktown 
on december   we completed the sale of the yorktown refining and terminal assets 
we continue to market refined products in the mid atlantic region through our wholesale group 
our primary operating areas encompass west texas  arizona  
table of contents colorado  new mexico  and the mid atlantic region 
in addition to the refineries  we also own and operate stand alone refined product distribution terminals in albuquerque and bloomfield  new mexico  as well as asphalt terminals in phoenix and tucson  arizona  albuquerque  and el paso 
as of december   we also operated retail stores in arizona  colorado  new mexico  and texas  a fleet of crude oil and refined product truck transports  and a wholesale petroleum products distributor that operates in arizona  california  colorado  nevada  new mexico  texas  maryland  and virginia 
we report our operating results in three business segments the refining group  the wholesale group  and the retail group 
our refining group currently operates the two refineries and related refined product distribution terminals and asphalt terminals 
at the refineries  we refine crude oil and other feedstocks into refined products such as gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel  and asphalt 
we market refined products to a diverse customer base including wholesale distributors and retail chains 
our wholesale group distributes gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricant products 
our retail group operates retail stores and sells gasoline  diesel fuel  and merchandise 
see note  segment information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for detailed information on our operating results by segment 
major influences on results of operations refining 
our net sales fluctuate significantly with movements in commodity values such as refined product prices and the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks 
the spread between our cost of crude oil and our sales prices for refined products is the primary factor affecting our earnings and cash flows from operations 
factors driving the movement in petroleum based commodities include supply and demand in crude oil  gasoline  and other refined products 
supply and demand for these products depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies  weather conditions  domestic and foreign political affairs  production levels  logistics constraints  availability of imports  marketing of competitive fuels  price differentials between heavy and sour crude oils and light sweet crude oils  known as the heavy light crude oil differential  and government regulation 
refining margins have improved consistently from through another factor that impacted our annual margins when we owned and operated the yorktown refinery was the year to year narrowing of heavy light crude oil differentials that began during the second quarter of  continued significantly through  and remained historically narrow during the yorktown refinery was capable of processing up to of its throughput capacity with heavy crude oil  and these narrow heavy light differentials had an ongoing negative impact on yorktown refining economics 
our refining results of operations for and reflect additional negative impact of various impairment charges and a loss on the disposal of certain refining assets 
discussion of these charges and loss follows below under long lived asset impairment losses 
other impacts to our overall refinery gross margins include the sale of lower value products such as residuum and propane as well as refinery production loss 
higher crude costs tend to have a narrowing effect on the margin for lower value product sales 
our refinery product yield volume is less than our total refinery throughput volume  a higher yield loss negatively impacts our gross margin 
also affecting refining margins within refinery cost of products sold is the impact of our economic hedging activity entered into primarily to fix the margin on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production and to protect the value of certain crude oil  refined product  and blendstock inventories 
included within our consolidated cost of products sold were net realized and unrealized commodity hedging losses of million for and net realized and unrealized commodity hedging gains of million for the majority of this activity relates to our refining segment and the remainder relates to our wholesale segment 
our refining cost of products sold includes million in net realized and unrealized economic hedging losses for the year ended december  and million in net realized and unrealized economic hedging gains for the year ended december  our results of operations are also significantly affected by our refineries direct operating expenses  especially the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity 
natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
typically  electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices 
demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months 
as a result  our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
the effects of seasonal demand for gasoline are partially offset by increased demand during the winter months for diesel fuel in the southwest 
refining margins remain volatile and our results of operations may not reflect these historical seasonal trends 
safety  reliability  and the environmental performance of our refineries operations are critical to our financial performance 
unplanned downtime of our refineries generally results in lost refinery gross margin opportunity  increased maintenance costs  and a temporary increase in working capital investment and inventory 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of planned downtime  such as a turnaround or a major maintenance project  through a planning process that considers product availability  the margin environment  and the availability of resources to perform the required maintenance 
periodically we have planned maintenance turnarounds at our refineries that are expensed as incurred 
we completed a scheduled maintenance turnaround at the south side of the el paso refinery during the first quarter of we completed a day refinery maintenance turnaround at our gallup refinery during october after december  we began a scheduled maintenance turnaround to be completed during the first quarter of for the north side units of the el paso refinery 

table of contents the nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial quantities of crude oil and refined product inventories 
because crude oil and refined products are commodities  we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories 
our inventory of crude oil and the majority of our refined products are valued at the lower of cost or market under the last in  first out lifo inventory valuation methodology 
if the market values of our inventories decline below our cost basis  we would record a write down of our inventories resulting in a non cash charge to our cost of products sold 
under the lifo inventory valuation method  this write down is subject to recovery in future periods to the extent the market values of our inventories equal our cost basis relative to any lifo inventory valuation write downs previously recorded 
we have also experienced lifo liquidations based on decreased levels in our inventories 
these lifo liquidations resulted in an increase in cost of products sold of million for the year ended december  and decreases in cost of products sold of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and see note  inventories  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed information on the impact of lifo inventory accounting 
wholesale 
earnings and cash flows from our wholesale business segment are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline  diesel fuel  and lubricants sold 
these margins are equal to the sales price  net of discounts less total cost of sales and are measured on a cents per gallon cpg basis 
factors that influence margins include local supply  demand  and competition 
historically  we purchased refined products to sell through our wholesale group in the mid atlantic region from various third parties 
on august   we entered into an exclusive supply and marketing agreement with a third party covering activities related to our refined product supply  hedging  and sales in the mid atlantic region 
under the supply agreement  we will receive monthly distribution amounts from the supplier equal to one half of the amount by which our refined product sales exceeds the supplier costs of acquiring  transporting  and hedging the refined product 
to the extent our refined product sales do not exceed the refined product costs during any month  we will pay one half of that amount to the supplier 
our payments to the supplier are limited to an aggregate annual amount of million 
retail 
earnings and cash flows from our retail business segment are primarily affected by the sales volumes and margins of gasoline and diesel fuel  and by the sales and margins of merchandise  sold at our retail stores 
margins for gasoline and diesel fuel sales are equal to the sales price less the delivered cost of the fuel and motor fuel taxes  and are measured on a cpg basis 
fuel margins are impacted  in descending order of magnitude  by competition  local and regional supply  and demand 
margins for retail merchandise sold are equal to retail merchandise sales less the delivered cost of the merchandise  net of supplier discounts and inventory shrinkage  and are measured as a percentage of merchandise sales 
merchandise sales are impacted by convenience or location  branding  and competition 
our retail sales reflect seasonal trends such that operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year 
long lived asset impairment losses 
we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in connection with the suspension of refining operations at our bloomfield refinery during  certain additional impairment charges were recorded during the fourth quarters of and based on the sustainable operational improvements of our gallup refinery during that were beyond what we had anticipated at the time of the bloomfield refinery idling  we determined that one of the three assets set aside for relocation to gallup was no longer required to attain our desired levels of production 
our fourth quarter analysis demonstrated that existing market conditions and availability of superior economic alternatives further reduced the potential benefit of relocating bloomfield assets to the gallup refinery  resulting in impairment of the two remaining assets initially set aside for relocation 
we recorded additional impairment charges of million and million  respectively  resulting from our fourth quarters of and analyses of specific assets that we had previously planned to relocate from our bloomfield facility to our gallup refinery 
these non cash impairment losses are included under gain loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and in september  in connection with the temporary suspension of refining operations at the yorktown facility  we performed an impairment analysis 
based on that analysis  we determined that the undiscounted forecasted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the yorktown long lived and intangible assets and thus  no impairment was recorded at that time 
during the period that refining operations were suspended through the date of the sale of the yorktown facility  we routinely monitored refining industry market data  including crack spread and heavy light crude oil differential forecasts and other refining industry market data to determine whether assumptions used in our impairment analysis should be revised or updated 
our impairment analysis included considerable estimates and judgment  the most significant of which was the restart of refining operations during the latter part of 
table of contents in connection with the execution of the agreements to sell the yorktown refining and terminal assets on december   we recorded a loss of million  including transaction costs of million 
this loss has been included in gain loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in a separate transaction with the third party buyer of the yorktown facility  we also sold an mile section of our new mexico pipeline 
the sale of this segment of pipeline resulted in a gain of million  including transaction costs of million 
we performed an impairment analysis on the remaining miles of our pipeline in connection with the sale and determined that no impairment of our remaining pipeline system existed as of december  this gain has been included in gain loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  factors impacting comparability of our financial results our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below 
debt and equity transactions during  we issued million in senior secured notes consisting of both floating and fixed rate principal amount notes 
also in  we issued million of convertible senior notes 
the conversion rate at december  is to each  of principal amount of convertible senior notes 
including original issue discounts oid we reported annual interest costs related to the senior secured notes and the convertible senior notes at rates ranging from to 
in december  we redeemed the entire million of floating rate notes at a premium to par of 
we made regularly scheduled interest and principal payments under our term loan credit agreement term loan through the first quarter of in addition to scheduled payments  we made non mandatory prepayments of million and million during the first and second quarters of  respectively  reducing the principal balance to zero 
as a result of the redemption of the senior secured floating rate notes and the amendment of our revolving credit agreement in and the retirement of our term loan in  we recognized losses on extinguishment of debt of million and million  respectively 
these losses are included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and collectively  the redemption of the senior secured floating rate notes and the retirement of the term loan have contributed to decreases of million in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to on july   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 
we may repurchase shares from time to time through open market transactions  block trades  privately negotiated transactions  accelerated share repurchase transactions  or otherwise subject to market conditions  as well as corporate  regulatory  and other considerations 
our board of directors authorized this share repurchase program through july   but may discontinue the program at its discretion at any time prior to that date 
during  we purchased  shares as part of our share repurchase program at a cost of million 
as of february  we have not repurchased any additional shares 
see note  long term debt  and note  stockholders equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for more detailed information 
asset impairments and disposals during the fourth quarter of  we entered into two separate agreements for the sale of the yorktown  virginia  refining and terminal assets and an mile section of our mile crude oil pipeline system in southeast new mexico 
gross proceeds for these two asset sales totaled million  resulting in a loss on disposal of the yorktown assets of million and a gain on disposal of the mile pipeline section of million 
during the first quarter of  we sold platinum assets from the yorktown refinery 
gross proceeds on the sale totaled million resulting in a gain on the sale of million 
a loss of million related to these disposals has been included in gain loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  during the fourth quarters of and  respectively  we recorded additional impairment charges of million and million resulting from our and fourth quarter analyses of specific assets that we had previously planned to relocate from our bloomfield facility to our gallup refinery 
these non cash impairment losses are included in gain loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we completed an impairment analysis of the long lived assets at our flagstaff  arizona  product distribution terminal following our permanent closure of the facility in the third quarter of the analysis determined that impairment existed  and we accordingly recorded a third quarter non cash impairment charge of million related to flagstaff terminal 
table of contents long lived assets 
this charge is included under other gain loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  employee benefit plans as of december   we have distributed million million in  million in  and million in from plan assets to plan participants as a result of the temporary idling of yorktown refining operations and resultant termination of several participants of the yorktown cash balance plan 
we contributed million and million to the yorktown pension plan during and  respectively 
subject to a memorandum of understanding between western refining yorktown  inc and the union representing the yorktown refinery employees  eligible terminated employees  both bargained for and non bargained for  were given the option of receiving either severance pay or coverage under the yorktown retiree medical plan  but not both 
the resulting choices made by the terminated employees reduced our benefits obligation by million as of december  an increase of million in and a decrease of million in 
currently  we do not plan to terminate the yorktown retiree medical plan 
commodity hedging activities  environmental cost recoveries  property taxes  and other our operating results for the years ended december  and included realized and unrealized net losses from our commodity hedging activities of million and million  respectively  and realized and unrealized net gains from our commodity hedging activities of million for the year ended december  the current year results are primarily the result of our use of swap contracts for the purpose of fixing the margin on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production 
see note  crude oil and refined product risk management  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion on our commodity hedging activities 
during  we increased our annual property tax expense estimate by approximately million resulting from revised el paso property appraisal rolls for we believe the appraised property values to be in error and have filed a lawsuit in state district court to appeal this appraised value 
our income tax provisions for the years ended december  and include the effects of a change in our valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  against the deferred tax assets for virginia and maryland generated through the operations of the yorktown facility prior to the sale of the facility in december during the latter part of march  we reversed million related to our accrued bonus for this revision of our bonus estimate reduced direct operating expenses and selling  general  and administrative expenses for by million and million  respectively 
planned maintenance turnaround during the years ended december    and  we incurred costs of million  million  and million  respectively  for maintenance turnarounds 
costs incurred during and related primarily to the planned turnaround for gallup 
we began a refinery maintenance turnaround at our gallup refinery during september that turnaround was completed during october during  we incurred costs of million in connection with a maintenance turnaround at the el paso refinery 
our next scheduled maintenance turnaround is during the first quarter of for the north side units of the el paso refinery 
we expense the cost of maintenance turnarounds when the expense is incurred  while most of our competitors capitalize and amortize maintenance turnarounds 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are noteworthy because they are based on estimates and assumptions that require complex  subjective assumptions by management that can materially impact reported results 
changes in these estimates or assumptions  or actual results that are different  could materially impact our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
inventories 
crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined principally under the lifo valuation method to reflect a better matching of costs and revenues 
ending inventory costs in excess of market value are written down to net realizable market values and charged to cost of products sold in the period recorded 
in subsequent periods  a new lower of cost or market determination is made based upon current circumstances 
under the lifo inventory valuation method  this write down is subject to recovery in future periods to the extent the market values of our inventories equal our cost basis relative to any lifo inventory valuation write downs previously recorded 
we determine market value inventory adjustments by evaluating crude oil  refined products  and other inventories on an aggregate basis by geographic region 
retail refined product fuel inventory values are determined using the first in  first out fifo inventory valuation method 
retail merchandise inventory value is determined under the retail inventory method 
wholesale refined product  lubricant  and related inventories are determined using the fifo inventory valuation method 
refined product inventories originate from either our refineries or from third party purchases 
maintenance turnaround expense 
the units at our refineries require periodic maintenance and repairs commonly referred to as turnarounds 
the required frequency of the maintenance varies by unit but generally is every two to six years depending on the processing unit involved 
we expense the cost of maintenance turnarounds when the expense is incurred 
these costs are identified as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
long lived assets 
we calculate depreciation and amortization on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of depreciable assets 
when assets are placed in service  we make estimates of what we believe are their reasonable useful lives 
for assets to be disposed of  we report long lived assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposal 
we review the carrying values of our long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset is not recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
if a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in order to test our long lived assets for recoverability  we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset being evaluated that include  but are not limited to  assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset  its estimated remaining life  and future expenditures necessary to maintain its existing service potential 
in order to determine fair value  we must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  interest equity rates  and growth rates that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset being tested for impairment 
intangible assets 
we amortize intangible assets  such as rights of way  licenses  and permits over their economic useful lives  unless the economic useful lives of the assets are indefinite 
if an intangible asset s economic useful life is determined to be indefinite  then that asset is not amortized 
we consider factors such as the asset s history  our plans for that asset  and the market for products associated with the asset when the intangible asset is acquired 
we consider these same factors when reviewing the economic useful lives of our existing intangible assets as well 
we review the economic useful lives of our intangible assets at least annually 
environmental and other loss contingencies 
we record liabilities for loss contingencies  including environmental remediation costs  when such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
environmental costs are expensed if they relate to an existing condition caused by past operations with no future economic benefit 
estimates of projected environmental costs are made based upon internal and third party assessments of contamination  available remediation technology  and environmental regulations 
loss contingency accruals  including those for environmental remediation  are subject to revision as further information develops or circumstances change and such accruals can take into account the legal liability of other parties 
certain of our environmental obligations are recorded on a discounted basis 
where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability  that estimate is used 
where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than other  the lower end of the range is used 
possible recoveries 
table of contents of some of these costs from other parties are not recognized in the financial statements until they become probable 
legal costs associated with environmental remediation are included as part of the estimated liability 
financial instruments and fair value 
we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices 
we use commodity future contracts  price swaps  and options to reduce price volatility  to fix margins for refined products  and to protect against price declines associated with our crude oil and blendstock inventories 
we recognize all commodity hedge transactions that we enter as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and those instruments are measured at fair value 
for instruments used to mitigate the change in value of volumes subject to market prices  we elected not to pursue hedge accounting treatment for financial accounting purposes  generally because of the difficulty of establishing and maintaining the required documentation that would allow for hedge accounting 
the swap contracts used to fix the margin on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these commodity hedging instruments are included in income in the period of change 
net gains or losses associated with these transactions are recognized within cost of products sold using mark to market accounting 
other postretirement obligations 
other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  future compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  health care cost trends  and demographic data 
changes in our actuarial assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our control and can have a significant effect on our other postretirement liability and cost 
a defined benefit postretirement plan sponsor must a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or liability for the plan s underfunded status  b measure the plan s assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and c recognize  as a component of other comprehensive income  the changes in the funded status of the plan that arise during the year but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
stock based compensation 
we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments  awarded under either of our long term incentive plans  based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of each awarded share is equal to the market price at closing as of the measurement date 
we amortize the expense on a straight line basis over the scheduled vesting periods of individual awards 
recent accounting pronouncements the accounting provisions covering the presentation of comprehensive income were amended to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income loss  the components of net income loss  and the components of other comprehensive income loss either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
these provisions are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after december   and are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance effective january  did not affect our financial position or results of operations because these requirements only affected disclosures 
the accounting provisions covering fair value measurements and disclosures were amended to clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and to change certain fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
amendments that change measurement and disclosure requirements relate to i fair value measurement of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  ii application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement  and iii additional disclosures about fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
these provisions are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance effective january  did not affect our financial position or results of operations because these requirements only affected disclosures

the increase in net income from to was primarily due to continued strengthening in our margin environment led by significant crude oil cost advantages reflected in refining margins and improved operating results in our wholesale and retail segments 
the year over year increase was also impacted by the lack of significant asset disposal losses in the current year 
offsetting a portion of the overall increase in net income were net realized and unrealized losses from economic hedging activities from our refining and wholesale segments compared to a net gain in the prior year 
we discuss economic hedging gains and losses in greater detail within our refining segment analysis under refinery gross margin 
we analyze segment margins as a function of net sales less cost of products sold exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
at a consolidated level  our margin decreased from to by million  due largely to a decrease in our refining margins of million  which is a reflection of unrealized commodity hedging gains and losses recorded within cost of products sold

our effective tax rate can be affected by any estimated tax credits that we plan to utilize for the year s estimated tax provision 
generally  such tax credits will lower our tax expense and effective rate when we have positive earnings and increase our tax benefit and effective rate when we have losses 
we recorded income tax expense during using an estimated effective tax rate of  compared to the federal statutory rate of 
our income tax provision includes the effect of recording a full valuation of million against certain net operating loss carry forwards related to yorktown operations 
we recorded an income tax benefit using an estimated effective tax rate of for  compared to the federal statutory rate of 
the effective tax rate was higher primarily due to the federal income tax credit available to small business refiners related to the production of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel

table of contents overview 
the increase in operating income from to  excluding commodity hedging activities  was primarily attributable to higher refining margins influenced by the strong margin environment and crude oil discounts 
we continue to realize the positive impact from the discount of wti crude oil to brent crude oil  and more recently the wti midland cushing discount at our el paso refinery  discussed under refinery gross margin below 
the year over year increase was also impacted by the lack of significant asset disposal losses in the current year 
partially offsetting the overall increase in operating income was a greater year over year loss from economic hedging activities 
refinery gross margin 
refinery gross margin is a function of net sales including intersegment sales less cost of products sold exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
refinery gross margin decreased from to due to an increase in net realized and unrealized economic hedging losses and lower sales volumes 
we enter into hedge contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price risks or to fix sales margins on future gasoline and distillate production 
we record unrealized mark to market gains and losses related to our economic hedging instruments based on the difference between forward crack spreads and the fixed margins that result from our hedge contracts 
we incur unrealized commodity hedging losses when forward spreads are in excess of our fixed contract margins 
we recognize hedging gains and losses within cost of product sold  which directly impacts our refining gross margin 
our refining gross margin included significant net realized and unrealized commodity hedging losses compared to net hedging gains in also  our refined product sales volume decreased from million barrels in to million barrels in excluding the impact of hedging activities  refining margin per throughput barrel increased from to  consistent with strong industry trends and our cost advantaged crude supply relative to industry benchmarks 
the gulf coast benchmark crack spread improved to in from in we base all of our crude oil purchases on pricing tied to wti  and our margins were positively impacted by the discount of wti crude oil to brent crude oil 
though it remains strong  the wti brent discount has been volatile over the past two years due in part to new and proposed crude oil pipeline capacity additions in the permian basin and at cushing  oklahoma 
we are uncertain as to the potential duration of this large differential 
during  the refining margin reflected the added advantage of the widening price differential between wti cushing crude oil and wti midland crude oil 
for our el paso refinery  this differential averaged per barrel for compared to for permian basin crude oil production continues to increase  providing additional cost advantaged crude oil for our el paso refinery and contributes to the discount we receive on wti midland crude oil 
total refinery throughput increased from to primarily due to operational efficiencies at the el paso refinery during and the lack of significant weather related disruptions at the el paso refinery as occurred in the positive impact in was partially offset by the scheduled turnaround that was completed at our gallup refinery during october direct operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
the decrease in direct operating expenses primarily resulted from decreased energy expenses of million due to the yorktown sale and the decrease in price of natural gas for the el paso and gallup refineries 
on december   we completed the sale of the yorktown refining and terminal assets  therefore  certain direct operating expenses associated with the yorktown facility that were incurred during were not incurred in also  maintenance expenses and chemicals and catalyst expenses decreased million and million  respectively  that primarily related to the yorktown sale 
these decreases were partially offset by increased property tax expense of million resulting from an increase in appraised property values for our el paso refinery and increased outside support services of million for inspections  outside engineering  and technical services at the el paso refinery and the jal storage facility 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged from to gain loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net 
the net gain during was primarily the result of transactions relating to the sale of catalyst from our refineries 
the net loss for was comprised of a million loss related to the sale of the yorktown refinery and an million loss related to certain bloomfield refinery assets  offset by a million gain related to the sale of a segment of our pipeline system and a million gain related to the sale of platinum assets at yorktown in the first quarter

the gulf coast benchmark crack spread improved to in from in we base all of our crude oil purchases on pricing tied to wti  and our margins were positively impacted by the discount of wti crude oil to brent crude oil 
beginning in early  our refining margin began to reflect the logistical advantage gained by our access to and use of wti cushing crude oil 
during  we began entering into hedge contracts to fix the margin on a portion of our future gasoline and distillate production 
prior hedging activities focused on mitigating the change in value of inventory volumes only 
our refinery gross margin included significant net realized and unrealized commodity hedging gains compared to net hedging losses in the impact of these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes of refined products in part due to the weather related outage at our el paso refinery during the first quarter of our sales volume decreased from million barrels in including million barrels sold from the yorktown refinery to million barrels in direct operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
direct operating expenses decreased from to primarily due to the million impact of idling the yorktown refinery 
also contributing to the decrease were decreased maintenance expenses of million  including a million insurance recovery for the weather related outage during the first quarter of at our el paso refinery 
partially offsetting these decreases were increased labor and repair expenses of million and increased material and supplies expense of million primarily related to repairs associated with the weather related outage at our el paso refinery during the first quarter of additionally  there were increased personnel costs of million related to higher incentive compensation  increased chemicals and catalyst of million associated with increased prices for the fluid catalytic cracking unit at the el paso refinery  and increased outside services of million primarily due to various scoping and engineering studies performed at the el paso refinery during selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses from to primarily resulted from increases in personnel costs of million resulting from higher incentive compensation during and the reversal of the incentive bonus accrual in the first quarter of loss and impairments on disposal of assets  net 
the net loss for was comprised of losses of million for the disposal of the yorktown refinery and million related to certain bloomfield assets offset by gains of million from the sale of a segment of our pipeline system and million related to the first quarter sale of platinum assets at yorktown

overview 
operating income increased million from to the increase was primarily due to increased fuel margins from our wholesale operations in the southwest offset by decreased margins from our northeast wholesale operations 
our margins in the northeast were mainly affected by the increase in realized economic hedging losses year over year 
on august  our wholesale segment entered into a supply and marketing agreement with a third party covering activities related to refined product supply  hedging  and sales in the mid atlantic region 
under the agreement we will receive one half of the amount our refined product sales exceed the supplier cost of acquiring  transporting  and hedging the refined products and we will pay one half the amount our refined product sales do not exceed the refined product costs  with an annual limit of million 
wholesale gross margin 
we analyze gross margin as a function of net sales including intersegment sales less cost of products sold exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
wholesale gross margin increased by million from to primarily due to a higher percentage increase in the average sales price per gallon in comparison to the percentage increase in cost of refined product per gallon from our wholesale activity in the southwest 
decreased fuel margins in the northeast served to partially offset the increased southwest margins 
the northeast margin decreased due to realized economic hedging losses compared to gains in we enter into inventory hedge contracts to protect our refined product inventory values from market volatility  and recognize hedging gains and losses within cost of products sold as these contracts settle 
this has a direct impact on our calculated fuel gross margin 
in addition  lubricant margin per gallon decreased year over year due to increased cost of lubricants without corresponding increases in the sales price 
direct operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
direct operating expenses increased from to primarily due to increased insurance premium rates  addition of new property leases and increased rents for existing property leases  higher maintenance and higher materials and supplies due to equipment additions to certain transportation assets 
partially offsetting the increases was a decrease in environmental remediation expense

table of contents outlook our refining margins were stronger in compared to the gulf coast benchmark crack spread improved to in from in our refining margins continue to be positively impacted by the discount of wti crude oil to brent crude oil  as all of our crude oil purchases are based on pricing tied to wti 
however  the wti brent discount has been volatile recently due to new and proposed crude oil pipeline capacity additions in the permian basin and at cushing  oklahoma 
these capacity additions could reduce the wti brent discount in future years 
permian basin crude oil production continues to increase  which could provide additional cost advantaged crude oil in the region 
we expect these trends to continue in thus far during the first quarter of  we continue to experience strong refining margins 
additionally  the widening price differentials between wti cushing crude oil and wti midland crude oil contributed to our el paso refining margins during this differential has been more volatile recently and has continued to contribute to our refining margins in early the gulf coast benchmark crack spread for january was

discretionary projects 
discretionary capital expenditures are those driven primarily by the economic returns that such projects can generate for us 
our discretionary projects include crude oil logistics projects  such as a gathering and storage project in the permian basin of southeast new mexico that we expect to complete in the second quarter of  and preliminary work on a potential crude unit expansion at our el paso refinery 
regulatory projects 
regulatory projects are undertaken to comply with various regulatory requirements  including those related to environmental  health  and safety matters 
our low sulfur fuel and low benzene gasoline projects are regulatory investments driven primarily by fuels regulations 
the deadline for compliance with the final phase of the ultra low sulfur diesel regulations to reduce sulfur in locomotive and marine diesel was june and affects our el paso refinery only 
epa regulations allow the one time use of credits to extend the june deadline by up to months 
our compliance strategy includes use of credits purchased in and a planned expansion of our el paso diesel hydrotreater 
based on current estimates  we expect to spend million for this expansion during our el paso and gallup refineries are required to meet mobile source air toxics msat ii regulations to reduce the benzene content of gasoline 
the msat ii regulations required reduction of benzene in the finished gasoline pool to an annual average of volume percent by beginning on july   each refinery must also average volume percent benzene without the use of credits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price fluctuation is our primary source of market risk 
commodity price risk we are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices  as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refinery operations 
our financial results can be affected significantly by fluctuations in these prices that depend on many factors  including demand for crude oil  gasoline and other refined products  changes in the economy  worldwide production levels  worldwide inventory levels  and governmental regulatory initiatives 
our risk management strategy identifies circumstances in which we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage risk associated with these price fluctuations or to fix sales margins on future gasoline and distillate production 
in order to manage the uncertainty relating to inventory price volatility  we have generally applied a policy of maintaining inventories at or below a targeted operating level 
in the past  circumstances have occurred  such as turnaround schedules or shifts in market demand  that have resulted in variances between our actual inventory level and our desired target level 
we may utilize the commodity futures market to manage these anticipated inventory variances 
we maintain inventories of crude oil  other feedstocks and blendstocks  and refined products  the values of which are subject to wide fluctuations in market prices driven by worldwide economic conditions  regional and global inventory levels  and seasonal conditions 
at december   we held approximately million barrels of crude oil  refined product  and other inventories valued under the lifo valuation method with an average cost of per barrel 
at december   the excess of the current cost of our crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories over aggregated lifo costs was million 
at december   we held approximately million barrels of crude oil  refined product  and other inventories valued under the lifo valuation method with an average cost of per barrel 
at december   the excess of the current cost of our crude oil  refined product  and other feedstock and blendstock inventories over aggregated lifo costs was million 
all commodity futures contracts  price swaps  and options are recorded at fair value and any changes in fair value between periods are recorded under cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of operations 
we selectively utilize commodity hedging instruments to manage our price exposure to our lifo inventory positions or to fix margins on certain future sales volumes 
the commodity hedging instruments may take the form of futures contracts  price and crack spread swaps  or options  and are entered into with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy 
we elected not to pursue hedge accounting treatment for financial accounting purposes on instruments used to manage price exposure to inventory positions 
the financial instruments used to fix margins on future sales volumes do not qualify for hedge accounting 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these hedging instruments are included in income in the period of change 
net gains or losses associated with these transactions are reflected within cost of products sold at the end of each period 

table of contents the following table summarizes our economic hedging activity for the three years ended december  year ended december  in thousands economic hedging activities recognized within cost of products sold realized hedging gain loss  net unrealized hedging gain loss  net total hedging gain loss  net open commodity hedging instruments barrels crude futures refined product price and crack spread swaps total open commodity hedging instruments fair value of outstanding contracts other current assets other assets accrued liabilities other long term liabilities fair value of outstanding contracts unrealized gain loss  net during the three years ended december   we did not have any commodity derivative instruments that were designated or accounted for as hedges
