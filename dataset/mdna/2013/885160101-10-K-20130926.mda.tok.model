table of contents on september   we acquired of towable holdings  inc  the parent company of heartland recreational vehicles  llc heartland  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement 
heartland is located in elkhart  indiana and is a major manufacturer of towable recreational vehicles 
under our ownership  heartland continues as an independent operation  in the same manner as our existing recreational vehicle companies  and its operations are included in our towables reportable segment 
industry outlook the company monitors the industry conditions in the rv market through the use of monthly wholesale shipment data as reported by the recreation vehicle industry association rvia  which is typically issued on a one month lag and represents the manufacturers rv production and delivery to dealers 
in addition  the company also monitors monthly retail sales trends as reported by statistical surveys  inc  whose data is typically issued on a month and a half lag 
the company believes that monthly rv retail sales data is important as consumer purchases impact future dealer orders and ultimately our production 
we believe our dealer inventory is at appropriate levels for seasonal consumer demand  with dealers remaining optimistic yet cautious in advance of the rv open house in september rv dealer inventory of thor products as of july  increased to  units from  units as of july  thor s rv backlog as of july  increased to  from  as of july  industry wholesale statistics calendar ytd key wholesale statistics for the rv industry  as reported by rvia  are as follows us and canada wholesale shipments calendar year through june  increase change towables units motorized units total excluding camping trailers and truck campers  which we did not manufacture in fiscal and fiscal according to the rvia  calendar year wholesale shipments for all rv categories are forecast to total  units  an increase over calendar year  with most of the unit growth expected in travel trailers and fifth wheels 
calendar year motorized unit shipments are forecasted to increase over calendar year travel trailers and fifth wheels are expected to account for of all rv shipments in the outlook for calendar growth in rv sales is based on rising consumer confidence  rising home and stock values  improved credit availability and continued slow gains in job and income prospects 
rvia has also forecast that calendar year shipments will total  units  a increase from the expected wholesale shipments 
industry retail statistics calendar ytd we believe that retail demand is the key to continued improvement in the rv industry 
with appropriate levels of dealer inventory currently  we believe that rv industry wholesale shipments will generally be on a one to one replenishment ratio with retail sales going forward

table of contents our outlook for future growth in retail sales is dependent upon various economic conditions faced by consumers such as the rate of unemployment  the level of consumer confidence  the growth in disposable income  changes in interest rates  credit availability  the pace of recovery in the housing market  the impact of rising taxes and fuel prices 
with continued improvement in consumer confidence  availability of retail and wholesale credit  low interest rates and the absence of negative economic factors  we would expect to see incremental improvements in rv sales and expect to benefit from our ability to increase production to meet increasing demand 
in recent years  the industry has benefited from growing retail sales to younger consumers with new product offerings targeted to younger  more active families 
in addition  a positive longer term outlook for the rv segment is supported by favorable demographics as more people reach the age brackets that historically have accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales 
the number of consumers between the ages of and will total million by  higher than in according to the rvia 
economic or industry wide factors affecting our rv business include the costs of commodities used in the manufacture of our products 
material cost is the primary factor determining our cost of products sold 
we have recently incurred modest increased costs in certain raw materials and components wood and lumber products and any future increases in raw material costs would impact our profit margins negatively if we were unable to raise prices for our products by corresponding amounts 
historically  we have been able to pass along those cost increases to customers 
to date  we have not experienced any unusual cost increases from our chassis suppliers 
the recreational vehicle industry has  from time to time  experienced shortages of chassis due to various causes such as component shortages  production delays or work stoppages at the chassis manufacturers which has impacted our sales and earnings 
recent limitations in the availability of certain motorized rv chassis have hindered our ability to increase production levels and are anticipated to continue through early calendar year

see note to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a description of the share repurchase transactions 
critical accounting principles our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that of our accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity 
impairment of goodwill  intangible and long lived assets in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment  to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
this guidance permits an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not defined as more than fifty percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the current two step goodwill impairment test 
the two step goodwill impairment test that begins with estimating the fair value of the reporting unit will only be required if the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the adoption of this guidance in fiscal year did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we review our long lived assets individually or in a related group as appropriate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable from future cash flows attributable to the assets 
additionally  we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually on april of each year 
accordingly  we continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances represent a triggering event that would require us to complete an impairment assessment 
factors that we consider in determining whether a triggering event has occurred include  among other things  whether there has been a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or competition related to the operation of the asset  whether there has been a significant decrease in actual or expected operating results related to the asset and whether there are current plans to sell or dispose of the asset 
the determination of whether a triggering event has occurred is subject to significant management judgment  including at which point or fiscal quarter a triggering event has occurred when the relevant adverse factors persist over extended periods 
should a triggering event be deemed to occur  and for each of the annual goodwill impairment assessments  management is required to estimate the expected net cash flows to be realized over the life of the asset and or the asset s fair value 
fair values are often determined by a discounted cash flow model  although we also use a market approach in determining fair values when appropriate 
these estimates are also subject to significant management judgment including the determination of many factors such as sales growth rates  gross margin patterns  cost growth rates  terminal value assumptions  discount rates and comparable companies 
changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the determination of cash flows and fair value and could potentially result in future material impairments 
management engages an independent valuation firm in many cases to assist in its impairment assessments 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of certain fiscal goodwill  intangible and long lived asset impairment charges 
as of july   the company has four continuing individual reporting units that carry goodwill 
one reporting unit carries of our consolidated goodwill of  and a second reporting unit carries another of our consolidated goodwill 
for these two reporting units  our estimate of their fair values exceeded their respective carrying values by and  respectively  as of our april  assessment 
the other two reporting units fair values exceeded their respective carrying values by and  respectively 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for workers compensation  products liability and group medical insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred  including those incurred but not reported 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined by the company with the assistance of a third party administrator and actuary using various state statutes and historical claims experience 
group medical reserves are estimated using historical claims experience 
we have a self insured retention sir for products liability and personal injury matters of  per occurrence 
beginning april   this sir for bus related matters is  per occurrence 
we have established a liability on our balance sheet for such occurrences based on historical data  known cases and actuarial information 
amounts above the sir  up to a certain dollar amount  are covered by our excess insurance policy 
currently  we maintain excess liability insurance aggregating  with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of our self insured positions for products liability and personal injury matters 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
product warranty we generally provide retail customers of our products with a one year warranty covering defects in material or workmanship  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold  existing dealer inventory  average cost incurred and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management believes that the warranty liability is adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
warranty liabilities are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on at least a quarterly basis 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  if any 
valuation allowances must be considered due to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets 
companies must assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets on a tax jurisdictional basis based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
we have evaluated the sustainability of our deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets which includes the assessment of the cumulative income over recent prior periods 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of recreational vehicles are recorded primarily when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or oral approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  if applicable  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product is removed from our property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
these conditions are generally met when title passes  which is when vehicles are shipped to dealers in accordance with shipping terms  which are primarily fob shipping point 
most sales are made to dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
certain shipments are sold to customers on credit or cash on delivery cod terms 
we recognize revenue on credit sales upon shipment and cod sales upon payment and delivery 
products are not sold on consignment  dealers do not have the right to return products and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floor plan lenders 
repurchase commitments we are contingently liable under terms of repurchase agreements with financial institutions providing inventory financing for certain dealers of certain of our products 
these arrangements  which are customary in the industry  provide for the repurchase of products sold to dealers in the event of default by the dealer 
in addition to the guarantee under these repurchase agreements  we may also be required to repurchase inventory relative to dealer terminations in certain states in accordance with state laws or regulatory requirements 
the repurchase price is generally determined by the original sales price of the product and pre defined curtailment arrangements and we typically resell the repurchased product at a discount from its repurchase price 
we account for the guarantee under our repurchase agreements of our dealers financing by estimating and deferring a portion of the related product sale that represents the estimated fair value of the repurchase obligation 
the estimated fair value takes into account our estimate of the loss we will incur upon resale of any repurchases 
this estimate is based on recent historical experience supplemented by management s assessment of current economic and other conditions affecting our dealers 
this deferred amount is included in our repurchase and guarantee reserve 
our risk of loss under these repurchase agreements is reduced because a we sell our products to a large number of dealers under these arrangements  b the repurchase price we are obligated to pay declines over the period of the agreements generally up to eighteen months while the value of the related product may not decline ratably and c we have historically been able to readily resell any repurchased product 
we believe that any future losses under these agreements will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  are summarized in the following charts 
we have no other material off balance sheet commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal after years operating leases chassis consigned inventory unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations all relates to discontinued operations 
we have included in unrecognized tax benefits  for payments expected to be made in fiscal unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of  have been excluded from the table because we are unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payment 
total amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments amounts committed less than one year years years over years guarantees standby repurchase obligations total commercial commitments the standby repurchase obligations generally extend up to eighteen months from the date of sales of the related product to the dealer 
in estimating the expiration of the standby repurchase obligations  we used inventory reports as of july  from our dealers lending institutions and made an assumption for obligations for inventory aged months that it was financed evenly over the twelve month period
