overview and strategic plan founded in  modine manufacturing company is a worldwide leader in thermal management systems and components  bringing heating and cooling technology and solutions to diversified global markets 
we operate on five continents  in countries  and with approximately  employees worldwide 
our products are in light  medium and heavy duty vehicles  commercial heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac equipment  refrigeration systems and off highway and industrial equipment 
our broad product offerings include heat transfer modules and packages  radiators  oil coolers  charge air coolers  condensers  building hvac equipment  and egr coolers 
company strategy our goal is to grow profitably as a leading global provider of thermal management technology to a broad range of on highway  off highway  industrial and building hvac end markets 
we expect to achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and selective acquisitions 
we focus on development of new products and technologies for diverse geographic and end markets  a rigorous strategic planning and corporate development process  and operational and financial discipline to ensure improved profitability and long term stability 
development of new products and technology our ability to develop new products and technologies for current and potential customers and for new and emerging markets is one of our competitive strengths 
we own two global  state of the art technology centers  dedicated to the development and testing of products and technologies 
the centers are located in racine  wisconsin and bonlanden  germany 
our reputation for providing high quality products and technologies has been a company strength valued by customers  and has led to a history with relatively few product warranty issues 
in fiscal  we spent million representing percent of sg a expenses on product and technology research and development efforts 
we continue to benefit from relationships with customers that recognize the value of having us participate directly in product design  development and validation 
this has resulted  and should continue to result  in strong  long term customer relationships with companies that value partnerships with their suppliers 
in the past several years  our product lines have experienced customer pricing pressure attributable to increased global competition  primarily from asia and other low cost regions 
at the same time  many of our products containing improved technology have helped us better manage demands from customers for lower prices 
many of our technologies are proprietary  difficult to replicate and patent protected 
we have been granted and or acquired more than  patents on our technologies over the life of the company  and we work diligently to protect our intellectual property 

table of contents strategic planning and corporate development we employ both short term one year and longer term five to seven year strategic planning processes  enabling us to continually assess our opportunities  competitive threats  and economic market challenges 
we focus on strengthening our competitive position through strategic  global business development activities 
we continuously look for and take advantage of opportunities to advance our position as a global leader  by expanding our geographic footprint and by expanding into new end markets and product areas all with a focus on thermal management technologies 
this process allows us to identify product and market gaps  develop new products and make additional investments to fill those gaps 
a recent example of this process is our acquisition of geofinity manufacturing company geofinity  which provides modine with a product line of innovative geothermal heat pumps in both water to water and water to air models  within our commercial products segment 
operational and financial discipline we operate in an increasingly competitive global marketplace  therefore  we manage our business with a disciplined focus on increasing productivity and reducing waste 
the competitiveness of the global marketplace requires us to move toward a greater manufacturing scale in order to create a more competitive cost base 
as costs for materials and purchased parts rise from time to time due to global increases in commodity markets  we seek low cost country sourcing  when appropriate  and enter into contracts with some of our customers that provide for these rising costs to be passed through to them on a lag basis 
we follow a rigorous financial process for investment and returns  intended to enable increased profitability and cash flows over the long term 
particular emphasis is given to working capital improvement and prioritization of capital for investment and disposals 
our executive management incentive compensation annual cash incentive plan for fiscal was based on roace  driving our singular focus on alignment of management interests with shareholders interests in our capital allocation and asset management decisions 
in addition  we provide a long term incentive compensation plan for officers and certain key employees to attract  retain and motivate key employees who directly impact the long term performance of the company 
the plan initiated in fiscal is comprised of stock options  restricted stock awards and performance stock awards 
the performance stock awards are based on three year average roace  cumulative revenue and europe roace at the end of fiscal consolidated market conditions and trends during fiscal  total company net sales were  million  a percent decrease from  million in fiscal sales were negatively impacted by weak demand in each of our end markets  along with the planned wind down of certain non strategic automotive module programs 
the oem marketplace is extremely competitive and our customers demand that we continue to provide high quality products as well as frequent price decreases 
from time to time  we also experience volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and in the costs of our purchased parts and raw materials particularly aluminum  copper  steel  and stainless steel nickel 
the combination of these factors impacts our profitability 

table of contents our response to recent market conditions in response to the challenging business and market conditions facing us in europe  we initiated our europe restructuring program in fiscal with the following objectives manufacturing realignment 
we are focused on exiting certain products based on our global product strategy  transferring product lines and reducing headcount  with the goal of reducing manufacturing costs and improving gross margin 
sg a expense reduction 
our europe segment is committed to controlling their overall sg a expenses and has implemented headcount reductions at the segment headquarters 
through this process we are targeting annual expense savings of million to million over the next couple of years 
improve segment earnings and lower assets employed 
during fiscal  our europe segment decided to exit several facilities 
we are currently marketing these facilities for sale 
in addition to the actions described above  the company is also focused on global strategic growth opportunities 
during fiscal  the commercial products segment acquired geofinity  a manufacturer of geothermal heat pumps of both water to water and water to air models 
this acquisition extends modine s current geothermal heat pump product range beyond airedale branded school applications to a wider market 
segment information strategy  market conditions and trends each of our operating segments is managed by a vice president or managing director and has separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision makers 
these results are used by management to evaluate the performance of each segment and to make decisions on the allocation of resources 
north america percent of fiscal revenues our north america segment includes products and technologies that we provide to the on highway  commercial vehicle and automotive markets  including class trucks  school buses  transit buses  motor homes  motor coaches and light trucks 
this segment also serves the off highway equipment markets  including agricultural  construction and industrial products eg lift trucks  compressors and power generation 
the recent weakness in the commercial vehicle  agriculture and construction markets resulted in a reduction in revenue for our north america segment in fiscal despite the revenue shortfall  our restructuring program that we completed in fiscal and favorable metals pricing allowed for positive operating results 
our manufacturing footprint consolidation and fixed cost reduction efforts over the past several years continued to provide operating leverage even with lower sales volume 
our north america business will continue to focus on growing in the markets where its products and manufacturing footprint create a competitive advantage 
the overall strategy for the north america segment includes the following reducing lead times to bring new or updated products to market and offering a wider product breadth  while at the same time evolving or rationalizing the existing product lines to meet targeted financial metrics that fit within our overall strategy 
balancing our customer and program portfolio and pursuing new business opportunities that meet our minimum targeted rates of return  thus enabling profitable growth for the company 
this includes a focus on both organic and inorganic growth opportunities 
growing revenue with an adjacent market focus in order to leverage the competitive cost structure and to improve asset utilization 
europe percent of fiscal revenues our europe segment is primarily engaged in providing powertrain and engine cooling systems  as well as vehicular climate control components to oem end markets  including automotive  heavy duty and industrial  commercial vehicle  bus and off highway 
these systems include cooling modules  radiators  charge air coolers  oil cooling products  egr products  retarder and transmission cooling components and hvac condensers 

table of contents economic conditions in europe remain weak with stagnant growth and euro truck program volumes continue to be low as a result 
we maintain our focus on continuous improvement by the deployment of the modine operating system  low cost country sourcing and cost containment 
our goal for the europe restructuring program is to improve return on assets by implementing actions similar to those that were previously completed during restructuring in the north america segment 
in addition  we expect our europe segment to benefit from various technology initiatives that allow us to distinguish ourselves from competitors in the eyes of our customers 
we also anticipate that this segment will continue to gain market share in the commercial vehicle and off highway segments as we focus on these strategically important markets 
the europe segment has recently been positively impacted by softening material prices  and has been successful in winning additional program awards  particularly in the commercial vehicle market 
these awards have helped to offset the planned wind down of a large automotive cooling module program 
in the future  we expect to continue to see price reduction demands from our customers  along with continuous and ongoing  increased customer service expectations and competition from low cost country competitors 
after the completion of the europe restructuring program  we believe this segment will be well positioned for improved long term financial results with a solid customer reputation for technology  service and program management 
south america percent of fiscal revenues our south america segment provides heat exchange products to a variety of markets in the domestic brazilian market as well as for export to north america and europe 
this segment provides products to the on highway commercial vehicle markets  off highway markets  including for use in construction and agricultural applications  automotive oems  and industrial application oems  primarily for power generation systems 
the south america segment also provides products to the brazilian  north american and european aftermarkets for both automotive and commercial applications 
this segment manufactures radiators  charge air coolers  oil coolers  auxiliary coolers transmission  hydraulic and power steering  engine cooling modules and hvac system modules 
the south america segment experienced a softening in sales after december due to the pre buy of commercial vehicles ahead of the january  change in government required emissions standards in brazil 
in recent years  there has been a continuing trend in brazil with customers moving away from copper based products and shifting to aluminum 
we are transitioning our manufacturing facility to ensure we have the necessary capability to supply our current and future customers as they transition to aluminum based products 
in the future  growth drivers in this segment include expected agricultural land and infrastructure improvements in brazil as well as the increasing regulatory focus on energy efficiency and environmental emission standards 
asia percent of fiscal revenues our asia segment is primarily engaged in providing powertrain cooling systems and engine products to customers in the commercial vehicle  off highway and automotive markets 
modine technology  performance  quality and reputation have enabled us to win new engine products business in asia 
emissions standards in china and india lag behind europe and north america 
as a result  some local on and off highway powertrain cooling customers focus on price versus technology 
however  in the future  we expect to see a shift in these markets towards higher performing  more durable products  which may provide us additional powertrain cooling opportunities at that time 
in addition  many components we supply in the region become part of a module  which increases the amount of our content on an engine 
our strategy in this segment is to control and reduce costs  secure new business  further diversify our product offering and customer base  and continue to focus on increasing our asset utilization and building manufacturing capabilities in china and india to serve the region in a cost competitive manner 
our manufacturing facility in chennai  india is currently producing at low volumes 
however  we expect continued increases in production levels for fiscal our manufacturing facility in changzhou  china is continuing to ramp up production 
in fiscal  we completed the transformation of our light assembly facility in shanghai  china into an engine products focused manufacturing facility 
we are scheduled to begin production of several new products from these three facilities during fiscal our objectives for this segment are to accelerate growth and achieve profitability 
we are well positioned to take on new programs and are looking to increase the utilization of our manufacturing facilities in china and india and increase revenue opportunities at our joint ventures in korea and japan 

table of contents commercial products percent of fiscal revenues our commercial products segment manufactures and distributes a variety of hvac products  primarily for commercial building and related applications in north america  europe  asia and south africa 
we sell our heating and cooling products through various channels to consulting engineers  contractors  and building owners for applications such as warehouses  repair garages  greenhouses  residential garages  schools  data centers  manufacturing facilities  banks  pharmaceutical companies  stadiums and retail stores 
our heating products include gas  electric  oil and hydronic unit heaters  low intensity infrared  and large roof mounted direct and indirect fired makeup air units 
our cooling products include single packaged vertical units and unit ventilators used in school room applications  precision air conditioning units  air and water cooled chillers  ceiling cassettes  and roof top packaged ventilation units used in a variety of commercial building applications 
economic conditions  such as demand for new commercial construction  growth in data centers  and school renovations  as well as higher efficiency requirements are growth drivers for our heating and cooling products 
the commercial products segment has higher margins than our other operating segments  and we intend to continue to invest in this business in order to capitalize on its higher returns 
in fiscal  we acquired geofinity  a manufacturer of geothermal heat pumps for both water to water and water to air models 
geofinity extends modine s current geothermal heat pump product range beyond airedale branded school applications to a wider market 
we have integrated the production of geofinity products into our west kingston  ri facility in order to leverage our existing capabilities to serve this growing market  both in the residential and commercial markets 
outlook for fiscal  we expect growth in south america and stabilization in the china off highway market 
in addition  we anticipate sequential improvement in the north american commercial vehicle market with the majority of this improvement in the second half of fiscal in europe  we expect further declines in the commercial vehicle and automotive markets and slight growth in the off highway market 
we anticipate consolidated year over year sales to be flat to an increase of percent 
we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to  excluding the impact of cash and non cash restructuring costs 
consolidated results of operations continuing operations fiscal sales volume declined percent due to an overall reduction across all of our business segments  primarily due to market weakness 
the company recorded impairment charges of million and restructuring expenses totaling million primarily related to our europe restructuring program 
as we continue our europe restructuring program  we expect to record additional restructuring expenses in fiscal in fiscal  sales increased percent as our end markets partially recovered from the economic recession

our current debt agreements require us to maintain compliance with various covenants 
under our primary debt agreements in the us  we are subject to an adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to interest expense interest expense coverage ratio covenant and a debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio covenant 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes  adjusted to exclude unusual  non recurring or extraordinary non cash charges and up to million of cash restructuring and repositioning charges  not to exceed million in any fiscal year  and further adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap metric that is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered an alternative to earnings from continuing operations

critical accounting policies the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
application of these policies results in accounting estimates that have the greatest potential for a significant impact on our financial statements 
the following discussion of these judgments and estimates is intended to supplement the significant accounting policies presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  recently issued accounting pronouncements that impact our financial statements are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  including agreed upon commodity price increases  as products are shipped to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers 
revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for sales rebates  volume incentives  and returns and allowances 
at the time of revenue recognition  we also record estimates for bad debt expense and warranty expense 
we base these estimates on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
contractual commodity price increases may also be included in revenue 
price increases agreed upon in advance are recognized as revenue when the products are shipped to our customers 
we recognize revenue from various licensing agreements when earned except in those cases where collection is uncertain  or the amount cannot reasonably be estimated until formal accounting reports are received from the licensee 
impairment of long lived assets we perform impairment evaluations of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and equity investments  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
we consider factors such as operating losses  declining outlooks and market capitalization when evaluating the necessity for an impairment analysis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  or the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
fair market value is estimated in various ways depending on the nature of the assets under review 
fair value can be based on appraised value  estimated salvage value  sales price under negotiation or estimated cancellation charges  as applicable 
the most significant long lived assets that we have evaluated for impairment are property  plant and equipment  which totaled million at march  within property  plant and equipment  the most significant assets evaluated are buildings and improvements  and machinery and equipment 
we evaluate impairment at the lowest level of separately identifiable cash flows  which is generally at the manufacturing plant level 
we monitor manufacturing plant financial performance to determine whether indicators exist that would require an impairment evaluation for the facility 
this includes significant adverse changes in plant profitability metrics  substantial changes in the mix of customer programs manufactured in the plant  changes in manufacturing strategy  and shifting of programs to other facilities under a manufacturing realignment strategy 
when such indicators are present  we perform an impairment evaluation by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated in the manufacturing facility to the net book value of the long lived assets within that facility 
the undiscounted cash flows are estimated based on the expected future cash flows to be generated by the manufacturing facility over its remaining useful life 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value of the long lived assets  such assets are written down to fair value  which is generally estimated based on appraisals or estimated salvage value 

table of contents the majority of the long lived asset impairment charges during fiscal  and have been recorded within our europe and north america segments for facilities held for sale to reduce their carrying value to estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the europe segment initiated a restructuring program in fiscal  including the decision to sell certain assets  which resulted in long lived asset impairment charges totaling million 
further unanticipated adverse changes in any of our segments could result in the need to perform additional impairment evaluations in the future 
impairment of goodwill we perform goodwill impairment tests annually  as of march  unless business events or other conditions exist that require a more frequent evaluation 
we consider factors such as operating losses  declining outlooks and market capitalization when evaluating the necessity for an impairment analysis 
goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level  determined to be at an operating segment level 
the first step in this test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit s net assets  goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and any impairment charge 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rate  business trends and market conditions 
the discount rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
to the extent that the carrying value of the unit s net assets exceeds the fair value  an impairment charge is recognized 
at march   our goodwill totaled million  which was primarily comprised of million in our south america segment and million in our commercial products segment 
the south america segment had operating income of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the commercial products segment had operating income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the future discounted cash flows of these segments continue to exceed their carrying value  indicating that the goodwill recorded in these segments is not impaired at march  warranty estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time of the sale and recorded in cost of sales 
estimated costs are based on the best information available  which includes using statistical and analytical analysis of both historical and current claim data 
original estimates are adjusted when it becomes probable that expected claims will differ significantly from these initial estimates 
tooling costs production tooling costs incurred by us in manufacturing products for customer programs are capitalized as a component of property  plant and equipment  net of any customer reimbursements  when we retain title to the tooling 
these capitalized costs are depreciated in cost of sales over the estimated life of the asset  which is generally three years 
for customer owned tooling costs incurred  a receivable is recorded when the customer has guaranteed reimbursement to us 
reimbursement typically occurs prior to the start of production  but this varies for some programs and customers 
we do not have any significant customer arrangements under which customer owned tooling costs were not accompanied by guaranteed reimbursements 

table of contents assets held for sale assets are considered to be held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market the assets for sale at a sales price reasonable in relation to its fair value  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  the sale of the asset is probable and expected to be completed within one year  and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan 
upon designation as held for sale  the carrying value of the asset is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
we cease to record depreciation expense at the time of designation as held for sale 
we are currently marketing for sale several held for sale facilities with carrying values totaling million at march  pensions and postretirement benefits the calculation of the expense and liabilities of our pension and postretirement plans is dependent upon various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions include the discount rate  long term expected return on plan assets and future trends in healthcare costs 
the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
these differences impact future pension or postretirement benefit expenses 
we replaced the existing domestic defined benefit pension plan with a defined contribution plan for salaried paid employees hired on or after january  we believe the current defined contribution plan for domestic employees will  in general  allow us a greater degree of flexibility in managing retirement benefit costs on a long term basis 
currently  none of our domestic pension plans include increases in annual earnings or future service in calculating the average annual earnings and years of credited service under the pension plan formula 
for the following discussion regarding sensitivity of assumptions  all amounts presented are in reference to the domestic pension plans since our domestic plans comprise all of the benefit plan assets and the large majority of our pension plan expense 
to determine the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider such factors as a the actual return earned on plan assets  b historical rates of return on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio  c projections of returns on those asset classes  d the amount of active management of the assets  e capital market conditions and economic forecasts  and f administrative expenses paid with the plan assets 
the long term rate of return utilized in fiscal and was percent 
for fiscal  the company has also assumed a rate of percent 
the impact of a basis point decrease in the expected rate of return on assets would result in a million increase in fiscal pension expense 
the discount rate reflects rates available on long term  high quality fixed income corporate bonds  reset annually on the measurement date of march for fiscal  we used a discount rate of percent  compared to percent in fiscal the company determined these rates based on a yield curve that was created following an analysis of the projected cash flows from the affected plans 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
changing the assumed discount rate by basis points would impact our fiscal pension expense by million 
a key assumption in our postretirement benefit liability and expense is the healthcare cost trend rate 
our assumed healthcare trend rate for fiscal year was percent  and we expect this rate to remain at percent for fiscal this rate is projected to decline gradually to percent in fiscal year and remain at that level thereafter 
an annual cap that was established for most retiree healthcare and life insurance plans between fiscal and limits our postretirement liability 
beginning in february  the company discontinued providing postretirement benefits for salaried and non union employees hired on or after that date 
furthermore  effective january   the plan was modified to eliminate coverage for retired participants that are medicare eligible 
a one percent increase in the healthcare trend rate would have an insignificant impact on our postretirement liability and expense 
other loss reserves we maintain liabilities and reserves for a number of other loss exposures  such as environmental remediation costs  product liability claims  regulatory compliance  litigation  self insurance reserves  recoverability of deferred income taxes  and uncollectible accounts receivable 
establishing loss reserves for these exposures requires the use of estimates and judgment to determine the risk exposure and ultimate potential liability 
the company estimates these reserve requirements by using consistent and suitable methodologies for the particular type of loss reserve being calculated 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding contingencies and litigation

in part i 
of this report 
other risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following operational risks our ability to successfully implement our europe restructuring plans and drive cost reductions and increased profitability and return on assets as a result  the overall health of our customers in light of broad economic and specific market challenges and the potential impact on us from any deterioration in the stability or performance of any of our customers  the impact of operational inefficiencies as a result of program launches and product transfers  our ability to maintain current programs and compete effectively for new business  including our ability to offset or otherwise address increasing pricing pressures from competitors and price reduction pressures from customers  costs and other effects of the remediation of environmental contamination  our ability to obtain and retain profitable business at facilities in our asia segment  and in particular  in china  unanticipated delays or modifications initiated by major customers with respect to product launches  product applications or requirements  unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties  including unanticipated launch challenges and warranty claims  increasingly complex and restrictive laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate and the costs associated with compliance therewith  unanticipated problems with suppliers meeting our time  quantity  quality and price demands  work stoppages or interference at our facilities or those of our major customers and or suppliers  and costs and other effects of unanticipated litigation or claims  and the increasing pressures associated with rising healthcare and insurance costs 
market risks economic  social and political conditions  changes and challenges in the markets where we and our customers operate and compete  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations particularly the value of the euro and brazilian real relative to the us dollar  tariffs  inflation  changes in interest rates  recession  restrictions associated with importing and exporting and foreign ownership  and  in particular  the continuing slow recovery of certain markets in china and brazil and the economic uncertainties in the european union  the impact of increases in commodity prices  particularly our exposure to the changing prices of aluminum  copper  steel and stainless steel nickel  our ability or inability to successfully hedge commodity risk and or pass increasing commodity prices on to customers as well as the inherent lag in timing of such pass through pricing  and the impact of environmental laws and regulations on our business and the business of our customers  including our ability to take advantage of opportunities to supply alternative new technologies to meet environmental emissions standards 

table of contents financial risks our ability to fund our liquidity requirements and meet our long term commitments in the event of any renewed disruption in the credit markets or extended recessionary conditions in the global economy  and our ability to realize future tax benefits 
strategic risks our ability to identify and implement appropriate growth and diversification strategies that position us for long term success 
in addition to the risks set forth above  we are subject to other risks and uncertainties identified in our public filings with the us securities and exchange commission 
we do not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  modine is subject to market exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices  credit risk and economic conditions 
foreign currency risk we are subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to our operations in foreign countries 
we have manufacturing facilities in brazil  china  india  mexico  south africa  and throughout europe 
we also have an equity investment in a japanese company and a joint venture in south korea 
we sell and distribute products throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we manufacture  distribute and sell products 
we attempt to mitigate foreign currency risks on transactions with customers and suppliers in foreign countries by entering into contracts that are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary engaging in the transaction 
our financial results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro  and changes between the us dollar and the brazilian real 
in fiscal  and  more than percent of our sales were generated in countries outside the us a change in foreign exchange rates will positively or negatively affect our sales  however  this impact will be offset to a large degree with an offsetting effect on our expenses 
in fiscal  changes in foreign currencies negatively impacted our sales by million  however the impact on our fiscal operating loss was less than million 
foreign exchange risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of percent in foreign currency exchange rates 
if these rates were higher or lower at march   there would not have been a material impact on our fiscal loss from continuing operations 
we maintain  from time to time  foreign denominated  long term debt obligations and long term inter company loans that are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
as of march   there were no third party foreign denominated  long term debt obligations or inter company loans for which changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact our net earnings 
we have  from time to time  entered into currency rate derivatives to manage the fluctuation in foreign exchange rate exposure on these types of loans 
these derivative instruments have typically not been treated as hedges  and accordingly  gains or losses on the derivatives are recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations and act to offset any currency movement on the outstanding loans receivable or payable 

table of contents interest rate risk our interest rate risk policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates 
we generally utilize a mixture of debt maturities and both fixed rate and floating rate debt to manage exposure to changes in interest rates 
our domestic revolving credit facility is based on a variable interest rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus to basis points depending upon our leverage ratio 
as of march   our variable interest rate was libor plus basis points  or percent 
we are subject to risk of fluctuations in libor and changes in our leverage ratio  which would affect the variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility and create variability in interest expense 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of march  a basis point increase in libor would increase interest expense by million based on an assumed revolving credit facility balance of million 
based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at march   a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense in fiscal by less than million 
commodity price risk we are dependent upon the supply of raw materials and supplies in the production process and have  from time to time  entered into firm purchase commitments for copper  aluminum  nickel  and natural gas 
we have utilized aluminum and copper hedging strategies  from time to time  by entering into fixed price contracts to help offset changing commodity prices 
the company maintains agreements with certain customers to pass through certain material price fluctuations in order to mitigate the commodity price risk 
the majority of these agreements contain provisions in which the pass through of the price fluctuations can lag behind the actual fluctuations by a three months or longer 
credit risk credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer failure to make payment according to contract terms 
our principal credit risk consists of outstanding trade accounts receivable 
at march   percent of our trade accounts receivables balance was concentrated with our top ten customers 
these customers operate primarily in the automotive  truck and heavy equipment markets and are influenced by similar market and general economic factors 
in the past  credit losses from our customers have not been significant 
we manage credit risk through a focus on the following cash and investments cash deposits and short term investments are reviewed to ensure banks have acceptable credit ratings and that short term investments are maintained in secured or guaranteed instruments 
our holdings in cash and investments were considered stable and secure at march   trade accounts receivable prior to granting credit  we evaluate each customer  taking into consideration the customer financial condition  payment experience and credit information 
after credit is granted  we actively monitor the customer financial condition and applicable business news  pension assets we have retained outside advisors to assist in the management of the assets in the defined benefit plans 
in making investment decisions  we have been guided by an established risk management protocol that focuses on protection of the plan assets against downside risk 
we ensure that investments within these plans provide appropriate diversification  are subject to monitoring by investment teams and ensure that portfolio managers adhere to the established investment policies 
we believe the plan assets are subject to appropriate investment policies and controls  and insurance we monitor our insurance providers to ensure that they have acceptable financial ratings 
we have not identified any concerns in this regard based on our reviews 
economic risk economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world or significant downturns in markets that we operate 
we sell a broad range of products that provide thermal solutions to customers operating primarily in the commercial vehicle  heavy equipment  automotive and commercial heating and air conditioning markets 
we operate in diversified markets as a strategy for offsetting the risk associated with a downturn in any of the markets we serve 
however  risk associated with market downturns  such as the global downturn experienced in fiscal and fiscal  is still present 
we monitor economic conditions in the us  in our foreign markets and elsewhere 
as we expand our global presence  we also encounter risks imposed by potential trade restrictions  including tariffs  embargoes and the like 
we continue to pursue non speculative opportunities to mitigate these economic risks  and capitalize  when possible  on changing market conditions 

table of contents we pursue new market opportunities after careful consideration of the potential associated risks and benefits 
successes in new markets are dependent upon our ability to commercialize our investments 
current examples of new and emerging markets for modine include those related to waste heat recovery and expansion into the chinese and indian markets 
our investment in these areas is subject to the risks associated with business integration  technological success  customer and market acceptance  and our ability to meet the demands of our customers as these markets grow 
we anticipate that continued recovery from the global recession and economic growth in china may put production pressure on certain suppliers of our raw materials 
in particular  there are a limited number of suppliers of copper  steel and aluminum material 
we are exposed to the risk of suppliers of certain raw materials not being able to meet customer demand as they may not increase their output capacity as quickly as customers increase their orders and of increased prices being charged by raw material suppliers 
in addition  we purchase parts from suppliers that use modine tooling to create the part 
in most instances  and for financial reasons  we do not have duplicate tooling for the manufacture of the purchased parts 
as a result  we are exposed to the risk of a supplier being unable to provide the quantity or quality of parts that we require 
even in situations where suppliers are manufacturing parts without the use of modine tooling  we face the challenge of obtaining consistently high quality parts from suppliers 
we have implemented a supplier risk management program that utilizes inside and third party tools to identify and mitigate high risk supplier situations 
in addition to the above risks on the supply side  we are also exposed to risks associated with demands by our customers for decreases in the price of our products 
we attempt to offset this risk with firm agreements with our customers whenever possible  but these agreements often contain provisions for future price reductions 
hedging and foreign currency forward contracts we use derivative financial instruments as a tool to manage certain financial risks 
leveraged derivatives are prohibited by company policy 
commodity derivatives we have entered into futures contracts  from time to time  related to certain forecasted purchases of aluminum and copper 
our strategy in entering into these contracts was to reduce our exposure to changing market prices for future purchases of these commodities 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  expenses related to commodity derivative contracts totaled million  million and zero  respectively 
we did not enter into any futures contracts during the second  third or fourth quarter of fiscal foreign currency forward contracts our foreign exchange risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk 
we periodically enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we have not designated these forward contracts as hedges 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses related to the change in the fair value of the contracts are recorded in other income and expense 
gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts are offset by foreign currency gains and losses associated with the related assets and liabilities 
we have a number of investments in foreign subsidiaries and a non consolidated foreign joint venture 
the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to currency exchange rate volatility 
from time to time  we use financial instruments to hedge  or offset  this exposure 
counterparty risks we manage counterparty risks by ensuring that counterparties to derivative instruments have credit ratings acceptable to us 
at march   all counterparties had a sufficient long term credit rating
