overview we operate in the following two industry segments sunopta foods  which accounted for approximately of fiscal revenues  sources  processes  packages and markets a wide range of natural  organic and specialty raw materials  ingredients and packaged food products  with a focus on soy  corn  sunflower  fruit  fiber and other natural and organic food products  and opta minerals  which accounted for approximately of fiscal revenues  processes  distributes and recycles industrial minerals  silica free abrasives  and specialty sands for use in the steel  foundry  loose abrasive cleaning  and municipal water filtration industries 
for a more detailed description of our operating groups and their businesses  please see the business section at item of the form k 
segment realignment and rationalization efforts in february  we undertook a process to streamline the operations and organizational structure of sunopta foods in order to drive efficiencies and better align product innovation and commercial activities 
during the first quarter of  operating segments within sunopta foods were re aligned according to the type of customers and markets served  rather than by product groupings 
as a result  the former fruit group was eliminated and a new consumer products group was created to focus on non grains based consumer packaged goods 
the consumer products group is comprised of the frozen foods and healthy snacks operations which were part of the former fruit group  and the food solutions operations which were formerly part of the international foods group 
the fruit ingredient operation of the former fruit group was merged with the existing ingredients group 
following this realignment and the divestiture of purity life natural health products purity as described below under business development  the international foods group comprises solely our international sourcing and supply operations tradin organic 
the grains and foods group remained unchanged 
sunopta inc 
december  k sunopta foods currently consists of four operating segments the grains and foods group  the ingredients group  the consumer products group  and the international foods group 
the segmented operations information provided in this md a for the current and comparative periods reflects these realigned operating segments 
in hand with these efforts  we also announced the rationalization of a number of operations and functions which resulted in a reduction of approximately of our salaried workforce 
once fully implemented  and after approximately in severance charges  this rationalization reduced annual costs by approximately  before tax 
in addition  we have recently taken steps towards the closure of the chelmsford  massachusetts office of the ingredients group  which involves the relocation of certain back office functions to our us corporate office located in edina  minnesota 
we expect that this office closure will result in annualized savings of approximately  once fully implemented 
the costs associated with the closure and relocation are not expected to be material 
business development cocoa processing facility the international foods group is constructing a cocoa processing facility in middenmeer  the netherlands  which will specialize in the processing of organic and fair trade certified cocoa beans into derivatives  such as organic cocoa powder  butter  and liquor 
all cocoa beans processed at this facility are expected to be sourced internally through tradin organic 
the facility will provide needed capacity to accommodate our organic and specialty cocoa business that is currently processed by third parties 
we expect the facility will be operational in the third quarter of once fully commissioned  it will employ approximately personnel and have an annual processing capacity of approximately  metric tons of raw cocoa

canadian food distribution in june  we completed the sale of our canadian food distribution assets to unfi canada  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of united natural foods  inc  for cash consideration of  cdn 
the divestiture of the canadian food distribution assets was an important step in our strategy to focus on our core food manufacturing platform 
the canadian food distribution assets formed part of the former distribution group operating segment  which was eliminated with this sale 
commodity prices commodity prices for corn and soybeans rose significantly over the course of fiscal  as a consequence of supply shortfalls due to crop failures following the worst drought conditions experienced in north america in many years 
although the overall crop is of fair to average yield and quality  we anticipate that we will be able to maintain adequate supply for our value added consumer packaged and ingredients businesses  as we source primarily from northern growing regions that were not as severely impacted by the extreme heat and lack of rain experienced in the southern regions of the us in addition  through our global sourcing platform we expect to minimize any shortfalls in supply for our lower margin commodity grain and feed sales 
with respect to pricing  our contractual relationships with customers for consumer packaged and ingredients products  as well as commodity grain and feed sales  typically allow us to increase our prices to recover increased costs of supply 
as a result  we do not anticipate that fiscal weather related supply shortfalls and commodity price inflation will have a material negative impact to our results of operations for fiscal critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require us to exercise our judgment and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we continually evaluate the information that forms the basis of our estimates and assumptions as our business and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates which we believe to be most important to our business 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of delivery of the product or service and when all of the following have occurred a sales agreement is in place  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
consideration given to customers such as value incentives  rebates  early payment discounts and other discounts are recorded as reductions to revenues at the time of sale 
sunopta inc 
december  k accounts receivable our accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from our customers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to us 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is our largest current asset and consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  valued on a weighted average cost basis  or estimated net realizable value except for certain grain inventories that are carried at market value 
in order to determine the value of inventory at the balance sheet date  we evaluate a number of factors to determine the adequacy of provisions for inventory 
these factors include the age of inventory  the amount of inventory held by type  future demand for products  and the expected future selling price we expect to realize by selling the inventory 
our estimates are judgmental in nature and are made at a point in time  using available information  expected business plans  and expected market conditions 
as a result  the actual amount received on sale could differ from our estimated value of inventory 
we perform a review of our inventory by reporting unit and product line on a quarterly basis 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in the inventory reserve 
grower advances prepaid and other current assets include advances to growers required to secure future delivery of product 
an allowance against realizing these advances is recorded when it is determined that we will not recover the advances  due to default on scheduled repayment terms  or general economic and market conditions 
advances to growers are typically made at the start of the growing season 
we monitor these advances for adherence to agreed upon terms  assess the status of the crops being grown  and evaluate general economic and market conditions in order to determine if the collection of the advance is at risk 
intangible assets we evaluate amortizable intangible assets acquired through business combinations for impairment annually  and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be recoverable 
our evaluation is based on an assessment of potential indicators of impairment  such as an adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  such as the loss of a significant customer  current or forecasted operating or cash flow losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  such as the introduction of a competing product that results in a significant loss of market share  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an intangible asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life  such as a plan to exit a product line or business in the near term 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
a discounted cash flow analysis is typically used to determine fair value using estimates and assumptions that market participants would apply 
some of the estimates and assumptions inherent in a discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of the projected future cash flows  and the discount rate used to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
a change in any of these estimates and assumptions could produce a different fair value  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in addition  an intangible asset expected useful life can increase estimation risk  as longer lived assets necessarily require longer term cash flow forecasts  which for some of our intangible assets can be in excess of years 
in connection with an impairment evaluation  we also reassess the remaining useful life of the intangible asset and modify it  as appropriate 
there was no indication of impairment of intangible assets based on the evaluation done for fiscal in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to write down of intangible assets of purity  which amount has been reclassified to discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture of purity  and related to intangible assets of our frozen foods operation 
in fiscal  we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of related to sale of our fruit processing operations in mexico and california  as well as a charge of  in connection with the closure of our brokerage operation in chicago illinois 
sunopta inc 
december  k goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available 
to evaluate goodwill  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine whether an impairment loss exists 
any impairment loss is recognized in earnings 
we measure the fair value of reporting units using discounted cash flows 
because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted cash flows include a terminal value 
the first year or base year in the calculation of the discounted cash flow model is based on actual results in each component  adjusted for unusual and non recurring items 
future years cash flows to perpetuity are forecasted based on projected revenue growth  and our planned business strategies in future periods that would impact actual cash flows reported in the base year 
examples of planned strategies would include a plant or line expansion at an existing facility  a reduction of working capital at a specific location  and price increases or cost reductions within the reporting unit 
the revenue growth and planned business strategies for future periods incorporated into the discounted cash flow model reflect our long term view of the market 
the discount rate is based on a reporting unit s targeted weighted average cost of capital  which is not necessarily the same as our weighted average cost of capital 
these assumptions are subject to change and are impacted by our ability to achieve our forecasts and by economic conditions that may impact future results and result in projections not being attained 
each year we re evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
there was no indication of goodwill impairment based on the testing done for fiscal years and in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to goodwill of the former natural health products reporting unit  which amount has been reclassified to discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture of purity 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the critical assumptions used in the fiscal annual impairment test 
acquisitions business acquisitions are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting 
under this method  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition 
any excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
the assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired generally requires the most judgment  and include estimates of future profitability  and or customer and supplier based attrition  income tax rates and discount rates 
changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed could impact the amounts assigned to assets  liabilities and goodwill in the purchase price allocation 
future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an asset or goodwill impairment 
in addition  amortization periods are subjective based on expected useful lives and chosen rates 
we determine the useful lives of intangible assets based on a number of factors  such as legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit useful life  and we consider the effects of obsolescence  anticipated demand  existence or absence of competition  and other economic factors on useful life 
note of the consolidated financial statements provide information with respect to businesses acquired and note outlines annual amortization expense relating to these intangibles 
some acquisitions involve contingent consideration to be potentially paid based on the achievement of specified future financial targets by the acquiree 
acquisition related contingent consideration is initially recognized as a liability at estimated fair value and re measured each reporting period with changes in the estimated fair value recognized in earnings 
these estimates of fair value involve uncertainties as they include assumptions about the likelihood of achieving the specified financial targets  projections of future financial performance  and assumed discount rates 
a change in any of these assumptions could produce a different fair value  which could impact the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities in the purchase price allocation  or the amounts recognized in earnings to reflect subsequent changes in the carrying value of the liability 
note of the consolidated financial statements includes disclosures regarding the estimated fair value of contingent consideration 
sunopta inc 
december  k contingencies we make estimates for payments that are contingent on the outcome of uncertain future events 
these contingencies include accrued but unpaid bonuses  tax related matters  and claims arising in connection with legal proceedings 
in establishing our estimates  we consider historical experience with similar contingencies and the progress of each contingency  as well as the recommendations of internal and external advisors and legal counsel 
we re evaluate all contingencies as additional information becomes available  however  given the inherent uncertainties  the ultimate amount paid could differ from our estimates 
income taxes we are liable for income taxes in the us  canada  and other jurisdictions where we operate 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate and will vary from year to year primarily as a result of numerous permanent differences  investment and other tax credits  the provision for income taxes at different rates in foreign and other provincial jurisdictions  enacted statutory tax rate increases or reductions in the year  the benefit of cross jurisdictional financing structures  changes due to foreign exchange  changes in valuation allowance based on our recoverability assessments of deferred tax assets  and favorable or unfavorable resolution of various tax examinations 
in making an estimate of our income tax liability  we first assess which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on our balance sheet 
we also estimate the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable 
this judgment is based on forecasted results in the jurisdiction and certain tax planning strategies and as a result actual results may differ from forecasts 
we assess the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied  the number of years based on management s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances 
if different judgments had been used  our income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
in addition  the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with our assessment 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the changes in the valuation allowance and the components of our deferred tax assets 
while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could differ from our accrued position 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal  provincial  state and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
stock based compensation we maintain a stock option plan under which incentive stock options may be granted to employees and non employee directors 
at each grant date  we are required to estimate a number of inputs  such as the estimated life of the option  future stock price volatility  and the forfeiture rate used in the black scholes option pricing model to determine a fair value for the options granted to employees or non employee directors 
prior to fiscal  the expected life and forfeiture rate of a stock option was based on historical exercise and forfeiture patterns  however  the expected life of stock options granted in fiscal was determined using the simplified method  as we changed the term of our stock option grants from six years to years and  as a result  our historical exercise data no longer provided a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected life 
future stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our common shares over the expected life of the stock option 
once determined at the grant date  the fair value of the stock option award is recorded over the vesting period of the options granted 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the inputs used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation

revenues for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december  revenues in sunopta foods increased by to  and revenues in opta minerals increased by to  excluding the impact of changes including foreign exchange rates  commodity related pricing  acquisitions and rationalized product lines  revenues increased approximately on a consolidated basis 
contributing to the increase in revenues within sunopta foods were higher sales volumes of value added aseptic beverages and other consumer packaged goods  and strong demand and higher pricing for corn and organic feed products due to the effects of the north american drought 
those factors were partially offset by lower revenues in our european ingredients operation due to economic uncertainty and a weaker euro relative to the us dollar  as well as lower volumes and pricing for fiber and fruit ingredient products

the increase in segment operating income at opta minerals primarily reflected the incremental contribution from babco and wgi  partially offset by a bad debt provision recorded in the second quarter of  related to the bankruptcy filing of a large steel products customer 
also contributing to the increase in segment operating income were lower employee compensation related costs  as a result of rationalization efforts undertaken in the first quarter of to streamline operations and improve efficiencies within sunopta foods  and the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements for the canadian dollar and euro relative to the us dollar

income tax provision for the year ended december  was  compared to a provision of  for the year ended january  the increase in income taxes was due to an increase in the valuation allowance in the year ended december  against current year losses that may not be realized in the future  as compared to a decrease in the valuation allowance in the year ended january  due to the canadian food distribution asset sale and the disposition of sunopta bioprocess

due to the loss of a significant customer and new product development efforts in the ingredients group  we incurred costs to curtail and retrofit certain of our manufacturing facilities throughout in addition  we incurred business integration costs related to our acquisition of lorton s 
as part of our rationalization of our frozen foods operation  we recorded a non cash write down on certain inventories where the carrying value was less than net realizable value  and wrote off long lived assets that could not be recovered through future cash flows 
partially offsetting these rationalization charges was a gain realized on the sale of land  building and processing assets located in mexico 
we also incurred excessive raw material and crushing costs in order to fulfil expeller pressed oil contracts at negative gross margins 
non cash gains were recorded due to a decrease in the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities owing to the former owners of dahlgren and edner  as predetermined targets to achieve the contingent consideration were not attained 
we believe that earnings from continuing operations attributable to sunopta inc is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted earnings from continuing operations  and that earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to sunopta inc is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap that is most directly comparable to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations 
the table above reconciles earnings from continuing operations attributable to sunopta inc to adjusted earnings from continuing operations and reconciles earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to sunopta inc to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations  in each case for the year ended december  adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are non gaap financial measures 
we believe these non gaap measures  which have been adjusted for the impact of the items listed in the table above  assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with us gaap

management believes that consumer demand for high quality natural  organic and specialty foods has grown rapidly over the past decade as global awareness of the benefits of healthy eating continues to proliferate 
the global market for organic products was valued at billion in according to the organic monitor  a specialist research firm focusing on the organic industry  with historical growth rates between and depending on product line and country 
we believe long term trends for growth remain in place 
while a large number of companies compete within specific segments of the market  we believe there are relatively few companies as well positioned as sunopta to take advantage of this growing market 
we believe that our integrated field to table business model built over the past years has positioned sunopta as a global leader in the natural and organic foods and natural health products markets 
for  we believe we will realize revenue and unit growth compared to  resulting from new product offerings  new and expanding customer relationships and incremental sales of natural and organic raw materials  ingredients and nutritious portable consumer packaged products in a variety of formats including flexible resealable pouch and aseptically packaged beverages 
we believe that consumers will continue to focus on health conscious natural  organic and specialty foods as concerns over disease  obesity and well being are center of mind and we feel sunopta is well positioned to meet the needs of these growing markets 
we believe that our net earnings for should improve versus as a result of improved volumes  pricing and product mix  increased capacity and capabilities  cost reduction and streamlining initiatives  and fixed cost leverage both in our plants and back office 
our primary focus for remains the improvement of operating margins and returns on assets employed towards our established goals of operating income as a percentage of revenues and return on net assets  within three years time 
consistent with  we have decided to take a cautious and responsible approach with regard to providing guidance  and in doing so  will not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance for at this time 
sunopta inc 
december  k we have defined a three pronged strategic framework from which key initiatives and near term action plans are developed  helping to create focus and a high degree of accountability for our businesses and employees 
the framework is as follows become a pure play natural and organic foods company 
this includes evaluating our existing product portfolio  integrating strategically aligned acquisitions  and divesting non core assets to focus on key market categories and geographies 
aggressively grow our value added packaged foods and ingredients portfolios 
this includes enhancing innovation through shared research and development capabilities  and the addition of new sourcing and processing capabilities to achieve higher gross margins from the introduction of new products  packaging and processes to the market 
leverage the integrated platform we have built 
this includes optimizing our supply chain capabilities  available production capacity  and consolidated back office functions to achieve synergies and cost improvements 
our overall objective of realizing profitable growth through an effective balance of internal growth and acquisitions in support of our integrated field to table strategy remains unchanged 
growth via existing customers  and the addition of new customers  is a fundamental objective and we are enhancing our key account and customer loyalty activities to support this 
in addition  we continue to look for ways to exploit strategic synergies across sunopta foods  integrating wherever possible 
initiatives to improve the productivity of operations include our continuous improvement programs  product rationalization  plant and warehouse rationalization programs  continued training and development of employees  consolidated procurement  supply chain and internal services programs and consolidated information and accounting systems to provide better analysis and timely decision making 
a more fulsome discussion of key strategies is included in item of the form k 
maintaining liquidity and having available sources of cash will be imperative to continue our growth 
as at december   we had  in cash  of which  may only be used by the operations of opta minerals 
we also had approximately  in unused bank lines for a total of  in cash and borrowings available 
our remaining cash and unused lines plus cash generated from operations are expected to be sufficient to finance capital spending estimated to be  to  and payment of the current portion of long term liabilities of  we believe additional sources of cash could be obtained through a combination of additional bank or subordinated financing  a private or public offering  the issuance of shares or through a divestiture 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing or transactions would be available or  if so  on terms that are acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements there are currently no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition 
contractual obligations the table below sets out our contractual obligations as at december  payments due by period total thereafter bank indebtedness long term debt obligations interest on bank indebtedness and long term debt b grain purchase commitments other purchase commitments operating leases long term liabilities commodity and foreign exchange contracts interest rate swaps sunopta inc 
december  k a this table does not include certain contingent consideration related to acquisitions completed prior to december  that may become payable if predetermined financial targets are achieved 
the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions completed after january  is reflected in long term liabilities in the table above 
b interest is calculated based on scheduled repayments over the periods as indicated  using existing interest rates at december   as disclosed in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all financial numbers presented in this item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are expressed in thousands of us dollars  unless otherwise noted 
interest rate risk variable and fixed rate borrowings carry different types of interest rate risk 
variable rate debt gives less predictability to earnings and cash flows as interest rates change  while the fair value of fixed rate debt is affected by changes in interest rates 
as at december   we had  and  principal amount of variable and fixed rate debt  respectively  with weighted average interest rates of and  respectively 
opta minerals utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates on a portion of its variable rate debt 
as at december   it held an interest rate swap with a notional amount of cdn  to fix its effective interest rate on this amount at plus a margin based on certain financial ratios  until february a basis point change in interest rates would have an after tax effect of on our earnings and cash flows  based on current outstanding borrowings and effective interest rates on our variable rate debt  taking into account interest rate hedging activities 
a basis point change in interest rates would not have material effect on the fair value of our fixed rate debt  based on the amount currently borrowed 
foreign currency risk all of our us subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency  and the us dollar is also our reporting currency 
in addition  the functional currency of the canadian corporate office is the us dollar 
the functional currency of our operations located in europe is principally the euro 
for these operations  gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our european subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
a change in the exchange rates for the euro would affect the fair value of our net assets by  with a corresponding impact to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the reporting currency of opta minerals is the us dollar 
opta minerals operates on an international basis 
the functional currencies of its canadian and european subsidiaries are the canadian dollar and euro  respectively 
for these operations  all transaction gains or losses in relation to the us dollar are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations  while gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
a movement in foreign currency exchange rates would affect the fair value of our net assets by  as at december   with a corresponding impact to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the euro appreciated against the us dollar during  with closing rates moving from at december  to at december  the canadian dollar appreciated relative to the us dollar in  with closing rates moving from cdn at december  to cdn at december  for each us dollar 
sunopta foods operations based in the us have limited exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
the european operations are exposed to various currencies as they purchase product from a wide variety of countries in several currencies and primarily sell into the european market 
it is our intention to hold excess funds in the currency in which the funds are likely to be used  which will from time to time potentially expose us to exchange rate fluctuations when converted into us dollars 
in addition  we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
open forward foreign exchange contracts were marked to market at december   resulting in a loss of december  loss of  which is included in foreign exchange on the consolidated statements of operations 
we attempt to reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts 
the net effect of all exchange based transactions including realized foreign exchange contracts  unrealized open contracts and all other foreign exchange transactions are recorded in foreign exchange on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of  december  a loss of sunopta inc 
december  k commodity risk sunopta foods enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain and certain other commodity transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to our assessment of our exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose us to risk in the event that the counterparty to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
we manage our risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved growers 
we have a risk of loss from hedging activities if a grower does not deliver as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
as at december   we owned  december   bushels of corn with a weighted average price of december  and  december   bushels of soy beans with a weighted average price of december  
as at december   we had a net short position on corn of  december  long position of  bushels and a net long position on soybeans of  december  
an increase or decrease in commodity prices of either soy or corn of would result in an increase decrease in carrying value of these commodities by december  
in addition  the international foods group hedges its purchases of cocoa to minimize price fluctuations
