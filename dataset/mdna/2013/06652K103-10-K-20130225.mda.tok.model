overview performance highlights in evaluating our financial performance  we consider the level of and trends in net interest income  the net interest margin and interest rate spread  the allowance and provision for loan losses  performance ratios such as the return on average assets and return on average equity  asset quality ratios including the ratio of non performing loans to total loans  non performing assets to total assets  and portfolio delinquency and charge off trends 
we consider growth in the loan portfolio and trends in deposit mix 
we analyze these ratios and trends against our own historical performance  our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region and nationally

the net interest margin  calculated on a tax equivalent basis  decreased to for from for the decline in the net interest margin resulted from a decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets  partially offset by a decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the primary driver of the decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets was a shift in the composition of the loan portfolio away from higher yielding covered loans into new loans originated at lower current market rates of interest 
the decrease in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities resulted from declines in market interest rates and a continued shift in deposit mix into lower cost deposit products

strong loan growth continued 
new loans increased by billion in to billion 
new loan growth in outpaced the resolution of covered loans  resulting in net growth in the total loan portfolio 
new loan growth was concentrated in the commercial portfolio segment  commensurate with our core business strategy

the charts below present the company regulatory capital ratios compared to regulatory guidelines as of december  and graphic opportunities and challenges management has identified significant opportunities for our company  including our capital position  market presence and experienced lending team position us well for continued organic growth in florida and the tri state market 
in addition to our core commercial banking franchise  we are building an in house residential origination channel and have entered the indirect auto and taxi medallion lending businesses 
planned expansion of our branch footprint  including three branches in manhattan scheduled to open in the first quarter of potential growth through strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and complementary businesses 
the potential to take advantage of lower market interest rates and the ability to shift deposits into lower cost products to further reduce our cost of funds 
the continued enhancement of our infrastructure and technology platforms will enable us to expand product offerings to our customers and increase operational efficiency 
we have also identified significant challenges confronting the industry and our company the current low interest rate environment is likely to put pressure on our net interest margin  particularly as higher yielding covered assets are liquidated or mature and are replaced with assets originated or purchased at current market rates of interest 

table of contents economic conditions in the florida market  while improving  remain under stress 
continued economic stress may lead to elevated levels of non performing assets or impact our ability to sustain the trajectory of new loan growth 
management expects that the company and the banking industry as a whole may be required by market forces and or regulation to operate with higher capital ratios than in the recent past 
uncertainty about the full impact of new regulation may present challenges in the execution of our business strategy and the management of non interest expense

impact of acquisition accounting  aci loan accounting and the loss sharing agreements the application of acquisition accounting  accounting for loans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination aci or acquired credit impaired loans and the provisions of the loss sharing agreements have had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the more significant ways in which our financial statements have been impacted are summarized below and discussed in more detail throughout this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the acquisition method of accounting  all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the fsb acquisition were initially recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values as of may  these estimated fair values differed materially from the carrying amounts of many of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as reflected in the financial statements of the failed bank immediately prior to the fsb acquisition 
in particular  the carrying amount of investment securities  loans  the fdic indemnification asset  goodwill and other intangible assets  net deferred tax assets  deposit liabilities  and fhlb advances were materially impacted by these adjustments  which continue to affect the reported amounts of such assets and liabilities  interest income  interest expense and the net interest margin reflect the impact of accretion of the fair value adjustments made to the carrying amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in conjunction with the fsb acquisition  the estimated fair value at which the acquired loans were initially recorded by the company was significantly less than the unpaid principal balances of the loans 
no allowance for loan and lease losses was recorded with respect to acquired loans at the fsb acquisition date 
the write down of loans to fair value in conjunction with the application of acquisition accounting and credit protection provided by the loss sharing agreements reduces the impact of the provision for loan losses related to the acquired loans on the results of operations  acquired investment securities were recorded at their estimated fair values at the fsb acquisition date  significantly reducing the potential for other than temporary impairment charges in periods subsequent to the fsb acquisition for the acquired securities 
certain of the acquired investment securities are covered under the loss sharing agreements 
the impact on results of operations of any future other than temporary impairment charges related to covered securities would be significantly mitigated by indemnification by the fdic  an indemnification asset related to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic was recorded in conjunction with the fsb acquisition 
the loss sharing agreements afford the company significant protection against future credit losses related to covered assets  non interest income includes the effect of accretion of discount on the indemnification asset  non interest income includes gains and losses associated with the resolution of covered assets and the related effect of indemnification under the terms of the loss sharing agreements 
the 
table of contents impact of gains or losses related to transactions in covered loans and other real estate owned is significantly mitigated by indemnification by the fdic  aci loans that are contractually delinquent may not be reflected as nonaccrual loans or non performing assets due to the accounting treatment accorded such loans under accounting standards codification asc section  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
these factors may impact the comparability of our financial performance to that of other financial institutions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under current circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent  objective sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly different estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
accounting policies are an integral part of our financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
we believe that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve a heightened level of management judgment due to the complexity  subjectivity and sensitivity involved in their application 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses alll represents management estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the company loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the alll is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its complexity and because it requires significant judgment and estimation 
estimates that are particularly susceptible to change that may have a material impact on the amount of the alll include the amount and timing of expected future cash flows from aci loans and impaired loans  the value of underlying collateral  which impacts loss severity and certain cash flow assumptions  the selection of peer banks used to calculate loss factors  estimated losses based on risk characteristics and risk rating of loans  and our assessment of qualitative factors 
note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the alll 
accounting for acquired loans and the fdic indemnification asset a significant portion of the covered loans are aci loans 
the accounting for aci loans requires the company to estimate the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected from these loans and to 
table of contents continually update estimates of the cash flows expected to be collected over the lives of the loans 
similarly  the accounting for the fdic indemnification asset requires the company to estimate the timing and amount of cash flows to be received from the fdic in reimbursement for losses and expenses related to the covered loans  these estimates are directly related to estimates of cash flows to be received from the covered loans 
estimated cash flows impact the rate of accretion on covered loans and the fdic indemnification asset as well as the amount of any alll to be established related to the covered loans 
these cash flow estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they involve significant judgment and assumptions as to their amount and timing 
covered single family residential and home equity loans were placed into homogenous pools at the time of the fsb acquisition  the ongoing credit quality and performance of these loans is monitored on a pool basis and expected cash flows are estimated on a pool basis 
at acquisition  the fair value of the pools was measured based on the expected cash flows to be derived from each pool 
for aci pools  the difference between total contractual payments due and the cash flows expected to be received at acquisition was recognized as non accretable difference 
the excess of expected cash flows over the recorded fair value of each aci pool at acquisition was recognized as accretable yield 
the accretable yield is recognized as interest income over the life of each pool 
we monitor the pools quarterly by updating our expected cash flows to determine whether any changes have occurred in expected cash flows that would be indicative of impairment or necessitate reclassification between non accretable difference and accretable yield 
initial and ongoing cash flow expectations incorporate significant assumptions regarding prepayment rates  the timing of resolution of loans  frequency of default  delinquency and loss severity  which is dependent on estimates of underlying collateral values 
changes in these assumptions could have a potentially material impact on the amount of the alll related to the covered loans as well as on the rate of accretion on these loans 
prepayment  delinquency and default curves used to forecast pool cash flows are derived from roll rates generated from the historical performance of the aci residential loan portfolio observed over the immediately preceding four quarters 
generally  improvements in expected cash flows less than of the expected cash flows from a pool are not recorded 
this threshold is judgmentally determined 
generally  commercial loans are monitored and expected cash flows updated at the individual loan level due to the size and other unique characteristics of these loans 
the expected cash flows are estimated based on judgments and assumptions which include credit risk grades established in the bank ongoing credit review program  likelihood of default based on observations of specific loans during the credit review process as well as applicable industry data  loss severity based on updated evaluations of cash flows from available collateral  and the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements 
changes in the assumptions that impact forecasted cash flows could result in a potentially material change to the amount of the alll or the rate of accretion on these loans 
the estimated cash flows from the fdic indemnification asset are sensitive to changes in the same assumptions that impact expected cash flows on covered loans 
estimated cash flows impact the rate of accretion on the fdic indemnification asset 
other real estate owned assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at the fair value of the collateral at the date of foreclosure based on estimates  including some obtained from third parties  less estimated costs to sell  establishing a new cost basis 
subsequent to foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed  and the assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
significant property improvements that enhance the salability of the property are capitalized to the extent that the carrying value does not exceed estimated realizable value 
legal fees  maintenance and other direct costs of foreclosed properties are expensed as incurred 
given the large number of oreo properties and the judgment involved in estimating fair value of the properties  
table of contents accounting for oreo is regarded as a critical accounting policy 
estimates of value of oreo properties are typically based on real estate appraisals performed by independent appraisers 
in some cases  if an appraisal is not available  values may be based on brokers price opinions 
these values are generally updated as appraisals become available 
equity based compensation prior to the consummation of the ipo  bufh had issued equity awards in the form of profits interest units pius to certain members of management 
compensation expense related to pius was based on the fair value of the underlying units on the date of the consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the ipo  the pius were exchanged for a combination of vested and unvested shares and vested and unvested options 
the fair value of pius and options issued in exchange for pius was estimated using a black scholes option pricing model  which incorporated significant assumptions as to expected volatility  dividends  terms  risk free rates and  prior to the ipo  equity value per share 
changes in these underlying assumptions would have had a potentially material effect on the values assigned to these instruments 
determining the fair value of the pius and the options issued in exchange for the pius is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgments and because of the potential materiality of the amounts involved 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further information about equity based compensation awards and the techniques used to value them 
fair value measurements the company measures certain of its assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring or non recurring basis 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include investment securities available for sale  derivative instruments and  for periods prior to the ipo  the liability for pius 
assets that may be measured at fair value on a non recurring basis include oreo  impaired loans  loans held for sale  intangible assets and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations 
the consolidated financial statements also include disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
inputs used to determine fair value measurements are prioritized into a three level hierarchy based on observability and transparency of the inputs  summarized as follows level observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets  level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are based on observable market data  and level unobservable inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation 
when observable market inputs are not available  fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses and option pricing models 
these modeling techniques utilize assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability 
particularly for estimated fair values of assets and liabilities categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy  the selection of different valuation techniques or underlying assumptions could result in fair value estimates that are higher or lower than the amounts recorded or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements 
considerable judgment may be involved in determining the amount that is most representative of fair value 

table of contents because of the degree of judgment involved in selecting valuation techniques and underlying assumptions  fair value measurements are considered critical accounting estimates 
notes   and to our consolidated financial statements contain further information about fair value estimates

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities and is the primary driver of core earnings 
net interest income is impacted by the relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the ratio of interest earning assets to total assets and of interest bearing liabilities to total funding sources  movements in market interest rates  levels of non performing assets and pricing pressure from competitors 
the mix of interest earning assets is influenced by loan demand and by management continual assessment of the rate of return and relative risk associated with various classes of earning assets 
the mix of interest bearing liabilities is influenced by management assessment of the need for lower cost funding sources weighed against relationships with customers and growth requirements and is impacted by competition for deposits in the company markets and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds 
net interest income is also impacted by the accounting for aci loans and to a declining extent  the accretion of fair value adjustments recorded in conjunction with the fsb acquisition 
aci loans were initially recorded at fair value  measured based on the present value of expected cash flows 
the excess of expected cash flows over carrying value  known as accretable yield  is recognized as interest income over the lives of the underlying loans 
accretion related to aci loans has a positive impact on our net interest income  net interest margin and interest rate spread 
the impact of accretion related to aci loans on net interest income  the net interest margin and the interest rate spread is expected to continue to decline as aci loans comprise a declining percentage of total loans 
the proportion of total loans represented by aci loans will decline as the aci loans are resolved and new loans are added to the portfolio 
aci loans represented  and of total loans  net of premiums  discounts  deferred fees and costs  at december   and  respectively 
as the impact of accretion related to aci loans declines  we expect our net interest margin and interest rate spread to decrease 
payments received in excess of expected cash flows may result in a pool of aci residential loans becoming fully amortized and its carrying value reduced to zero even though outstanding contractual balances remain related to loans in the pool 
once the carrying value of a pool is reduced to zero  any future proceeds from the remaining loans are recognized as interest income upon receipt 
the carrying value of one pool was reduced to zero in late future expected cash flows from this pool totaled million as of december  the upb of loans remaining in this pool was million at december  the timing of receipt of proceeds from loans in this pool may be unpredictable  leading to increased volatility in the yield on the pool 
fair value adjustments of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities recorded at the time of the fsb acquisition are accreted to interest income or expense over the lives of the related assets or liabilities 
generally  accretion of these fair value adjustments increases interest income and 
table of contents decreases interest expense  and thus has a positive impact on our net interest income  net interest margin and interest rate spread 
the impact of accretion of fair value adjustments on interest income and interest expense will continue to decline as these assets and liabilities mature or are repaid and constitute a smaller portion of total interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the impact of accretion and aci loan accounting on net interest income makes it difficult to compare our net interest margin and interest rate spread to those reported by other financial institutions 
the following tables present  for the years ended december   and  information about i average balances  the total dollar amount of taxable equivalent interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields  ii average balances  the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates  iii net interest income  iv the interest rate spread  and v the net interest margin

table of contents increases and decreases in interest income  calculated on a tax equivalent basis  and interest expense result from changes in average balances volume of interest earning assets and liabilities  as well as changes in average interest rates 
the following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest bearing liabilities for the years indicated 
the effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year average rate 
similarly  the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average rate by the previous year volume 
changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume in thousands compared to compared to change due to volume change due to rate increase decrease change due to volume change due to rate increase decrease interest income attributable to loans investment securities available for sale other interest earning assets total interest income interest expense attributable to interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits total interest bearing deposits fhlb advances short term borrowings total interest expense increase decrease in net interest income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net interest income  calculated on a tax equivalent basis  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in net interest income was comprised of an increase in interest income of million and a decrease in interest expense of million 
the increase in tax equivalent interest income resulted primarily from a million increase in interest income from loans and an million increase in interest income from investment securities available for sale 
increased interest income from loans was attributable to a billion increase in the average balance outstanding offset by a decrease in the average yield to for from for offsetting factors contributed to the overall decline in the yield on loans new loans originated at lower market rates of interest comprised a greater percentage of the portfolio in than in new loans represented of the average balance of loans outstanding in as compared to in the tax equivalent yield on new loans was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  we expect the impact of growth of the new loan portfolio to lead to further declines in the overall yield on loans in future periods 
the yield on loans acquired in the fsb acquisition increased to for as compared to for this increase resulted from i generally improved default frequency and 
table of contents severity rates leading to an increase in expected cash flows  ii covered loans being resolved at a faster rate than previously expected leading to acceleration of both actual and forecasted cash flows and higher accretion and iii recognition of all proceeds from resolution of loans in the residential pool with a carrying value of zero as interest income  as discussed above 
specifically  proceeds of million from the sale of loans in this pool were recognized as interest income in the fourth quarter of the average balance of investment securities available for sale increased by billion for the year ended december  over the year ended december  while the yield declined to for from for the decline in yield was primarily a result of adding securities to the portfolio at lower prevailing rates 
the primary components of the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  were a million decline in interest expense on deposits and a million decline in interest expense on fhlb advances and other borrowings 
the most significant factor contributing to the decline in interest expense on deposits was a decline in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits to in as compared to in  partly offset by a billion increase in the average balance outstanding 
the decrease in average rate resulted primarily from a decline in market rates of interest across deposit products 
specifically  the average rate paid on savings and money market deposits declined to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   a decrease of 
the average rate paid on time deposits  inclusive of accretion of fair value adjustments  declined by to in from in excluding the impact of accretion of fair value adjustments  the average rate paid on time deposits declined by  to from 
accretion of fair value adjustments declined by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the average rate paid on fhlb advances  inclusive of the impact of cash flow hedges and fair value accretion  declined by  to in from in this decline resulted primarily from maturing advances being rolled over at lower market rates  partially offset by a decline of million in accretion of fair value adjustments 
the impact of accretion of fair value adjustments on interest expense will continue to decline as the related borrowings mature 
the net interest margin  calculated on a tax equivalent basis  for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december   a decrease of basis points 
the interest rate spread declined to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the declines in net interest margin and interest rate spread resulted primarily from lower yields on loans and investment securities partly offset by a lower cost of deposits and borrowings  as discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net interest income  calculated on a tax equivalent basis  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was comprised of an increase in interest income of million coupled with a decline in interest expense of million 
the increase in tax equivalent interest income was primarily driven by an million increase in interest income from loans 
the average yield on loans increased by basis points  to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily because of an increase in the yield on loans acquired in the fsb acquisition to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase resulted from i covered loans being resolved at a faster rate than expected  resulting in higher accretion  ii improved default frequency and severity rates leading to an increase in expected cash flows  iii favorable resolutions of commercial aci loans  and iv to a lesser extent  recognition of all 
table of contents proceeds from resolution of loans in one residential pool with a carrying value of zero as interest income  as discussed above 
the average yield on new loans declined to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily due to continued declines in market interest rates 
new loans constituted of loans  net of premiums  discounts  deferred fees and costs  at december  as compared to at december  the overall increase in the average yield on loans was in part offset by a decrease of million in the average balance outstanding 
the decrease in the average balance of loans resulted from paydowns and resolutions of covered loans  partially offset by growth in the new loan portfolio 
the average balance of loans acquired in the fsb acquisition declined to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december   while the average balance of new loans grew to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income from investment securities  calculated on a tax equivalent basis  increased by million as a result of a million increase in the average balance  substantially offset by a decline in the average yield to from 
the decline in average yield is indicative of the addition of securities to the portfolio at lower prevailing market rates of interest 
the decline in interest expense for the year ended december  was primarily driven by a decrease of million in interest expense on deposits  partially offset by an increase of million in interest expense on fhlb advances 
the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined by basis points  to from 
three factors contributed to the decline in the average rate paid on deposits 
a decrease in market rates of interest across all deposit product groups and continued runoff of higher cost time deposits were partially offset by a reduction in accretion of acquisition date fair value adjustments 
accretion of fair value adjustments on time deposits totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  accretion continues to decrease as time deposits outstanding at the date of the fsb acquisition mature 
the average rate paid on time deposits  exclusive of fair value accretion  declined to for from for a decline in the overall average balance of deposits also contributed to reduced interest expense 
consistent with our strategy of replacing more costly time deposits with lower cost deposits  the average balance of time deposits declined by billion while the average balance of interest bearing demand  savings and money market deposits increased by million 
the increase in interest expense on fhlb advances was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in accretion of acquisition date fair value adjustments 
the net interest margin  calculated on a tax equivalent basis  increased by basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  similarly  the interest rate spread increased by basis points to for from for increases in the net interest margin and interest rate spread were driven primarily by the increased yield on loans and the lower cost of interest bearing deposits discussed above 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that  based on our judgment  is required to maintain the alll at an adequate level to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and that  in management judgment  is appropriate under us generally accepted accounting principles 
the determination of the amount of the alll is complex and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity 
our determination of the amount of the allowance and corresponding provision for loan losses considers ongoing evaluations of the various segments of the loan portfolio and of individually significant credits  levels of non performing loans and charge offs  statistical trends and economic and other relevant factors 
see analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses below for more information about how we determine the appropriate level of the allowance 

table of contents because the determination of fair value at which the loans acquired in the fsb acquisition were initially recorded encompassed assumptions about expected future cash flows and credit risk  no alll was recorded at the date of acquisition 
an allowance related to aci loans is recorded only when estimates of future cash flows related to these loans are revised downward  indicating further deterioration in credit quality 
an allowance for non aci loans may be established if factors considered relevant by management indicate that the credit quality of the non aci loans has deteriorated 
since the recognition of a provision for recovery of loan losses on covered loans represents an increase reduction in the amount of reimbursement we ultimately expect to receive from the fdic  we also record an increase decrease in the fdic indemnification asset for the present value of the projected increase reduction in reimbursement  with a corresponding increase decrease in non interest income  recorded in net gain loss on indemnification asset as discussed below in the section entitled non interest income 
therefore  the impact on our results of operations of any provision for recovery of loan losses on covered loans is significantly mitigated by the corresponding impact on non interest income 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded provisions for recoveries of losses on covered loans of million  million and million and increases reductions in related non interest income of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded provisions for loan losses of million  million and million  respectively  related to new loans 
these loans are not protected by the loss sharing agreements and as such  these provisions are not offset by increases in non interest income 
the provision for new loans declined for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in spite of increased loan growth in the impact of loan growth on the provision for loan losses was partially offset by decreases in the peer group loss factors applied in determining the alll for the new commercial portfolio 
see the section entitled analysis of the allowance for loan and leases below for further discussion 
the increase in the provision for losses on new loans for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from growth in the new loan portfolio 
non interest income the company reported non interest income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of our non interest income resulted from the resolution of assets covered by our loss sharing agreements with the fdic and accretion of discount on the fdic indemnification asset 
typically  the primary components of non interest income of financial institutions are service charges and fees and gains or losses related to the sale or valuation of investment securities  loans and other assets 
thus  it is difficult to compare the amount and composition of our non interest income with that of other financial institutions of our size 

table of contents the following table presents a comparison of the categories of non interest income for the years ended december   and in thousands accretion of discount on fdic indemnification asset income from resolution of covered assets  net net gain loss on indemnification asset fdic reimbursement of costs of resolution of covered assets loss on sale of covered loans  net non interest income from covered assets service charges and fees gain on sale of non covered loans  net gain loss on sale or exchange of investment securities available for sale  net loss on extinguishment of debt loss on termination of interest rate swap mortgage insurance income settlement with the fdic other non interest income non interest income related to transactions in the covered assets accretion of discount on the fdic indemnification asset totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accretion is a result of discounting and may also increase or decrease from period to period due to changes in expected cash flows from the aci loans 
the fdic indemnification asset was initially recorded at its estimated fair value of billion  representing the present value of estimated future cash payments from the fdic for probable losses on covered assets  up to days of past due interest  excluding interest related to loans on nonaccrual at acquisition  and reimbursement of certain expenses 
a discount rate of  determined using a risk free yield curve plus a premium reflecting uncertainty related to the collection  amount and timing of cash flows and liquidity concerns  was used in the initial calculation of fair value 
if projected cash flows from the aci loans increase  the yield on the loans will increase accordingly and the discount rate of accretion on the fdic indemnification asset will decrease as less cash flow is expected to be recovered from the indemnification asset 
for the years ended december   and  the average rate at which discount was accreted on the fdic indemnification asset was  and  respectively 
the decrease in total accretion for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  related both to the decrease in the average discount rate resulting from increases in projected cash flows from the aci loans and to the decrease in the average balance of the indemnification asset 
the average balance of the indemnification asset decreased primarily as a result of the submission of claims and receipt of cash from the fdic under the terms of the loss sharing agreements 
we expect the accretion rate to be negative  and to begin recording amortization of  rather than accretion on  the indemnification asset beginning in the first quarter of additionally  as we continue to submit claims under the loss sharing agreements  the balance of the indemnification asset will continue to decline 

table of contents the balance of the fdic indemnification asset is also reduced or increased as a result of decreases or increases in estimated cash flows to be received from the fdic related to the gains or losses recorded in our consolidated financial statements from transactions in the covered assets 
when these transaction gains or losses are recorded  we also record an offsetting amount in the statement of income line item net gain loss on indemnification asset 
this line item includes the significantly mitigating impact of fdic indemnification related to the following types of transactions in covered assets gains or losses from the resolution of covered assets  provisions for recoveries of losses on covered loans  gains or losses on the sale of covered loans  gains or losses on the sale of oreo  and impairment of oreo 
each of these types of transactions is discussed further below 
a rollforward of the fdic indemnification asset from december  to december  follows in thousands balance  december  accretion reduction for claims filed net gain on indemnification asset balance  december  accretion reduction for claims filed net gain on indemnification asset balance  december  accretion reduction for claims filed net loss on indemnification asset balance  december  covered loans may be resolved through prepayment  short sale of the underlying collateral  foreclosure  sale of the loans or charge off 
for loans resolved through prepayment  short sale or foreclosure  the difference between consideration received in resolution of the loans and the carrying value of the loans is recorded in the consolidated statement of income line item income from resolution of covered assets  net 
both gains and losses on individual resolutions are included in this line item 
losses from the resolution of covered loans increase the amount recoverable from the fdic under the loss sharing agreements 
gains from the resolution of covered loans reduce the amount recoverable from the fdic under the loss sharing agreements 
these additions to or reductions in amounts recoverable from the fdic related to the resolution of covered loans are recorded in non interest income in the line item net gain loss on indemnification asset and reflected as corresponding increases or decreases in the fdic indemnification asset 
the amount of income recorded in any period will be impacted by the number and upb of aci loans resolved  the amount of consideration received  and our ability to accurately project cash flows from aci loans in future periods 
as history of the performance and resolution of aci loans has grown and we have updated our projections of cash flows from the aci loans  gains or losses recorded on resolution of covered loans 
table of contents have declined in absolute terms 
as our projections of cash flows from the aci loans have been updated  these cash flows have increasingly been reflected in interest income  through increased yields and higher accretion  rather than in income from resolution of covered assets 
for the years ended december   and  aci loans with a upb of billion  billion and billion were resolved by payment in full  foreclosure or short sale 
the following table provides further detail of the components of income from resolution of covered assets  net for the years ended december   and in thousands payments in full foreclosures short sales modifications charge offs recoveries income from resolution of covered assets  net as expected  the impact of payments in full on the results of operations declined for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as well as for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this is a result of additional history with the performance of covered loans being reflected in our updated cash flow forecasts and a decline in the number of paid in full resolutions 
we expect the impact on non interest income of resolutions from payments in full to decline further in the future as we continue to update our cash flow forecasts and the number of loans in the portfolio likely to be resolved in this manner decreases 
a decline in the level of foreclosure and short sale activity coupled with improving home prices led to a decrease in losses on resolutions from foreclosures and short sales for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in contrast  home price depreciation in our primary market areas led to increased losses  or declines in net gains  from short sales and foreclosures for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the impact of charge offs has declined year over year due primarily to reductions in the number and dollar amount of charge offs of home equity lines of credit 
under the purchase and assumption agreement  we are permitted to sell on an annual basis up to of the covered loans  based upon the upb at the time of the fsb acquisition  or approximately million  without prior consent of the fdic 
any losses incurred from such loan sales are covered under the loss sharing agreements 
the significantly mitigating amounts recoverable from the fdic related to these losses are recorded as increases in the fdic indemnification asset and corresponding increases in the non interest income line item net gain loss on indemnification asset 

table of contents sales of covered loans for the years ended december   and are summarized as follows in thousands unpaid principal balance of loans sold gross cash proceeds carrying value of loans sold transaction costs incurred net pre tax impact on earnings  excluding gain on indemnification asset loss on sale of covered loans proceeds recorded in interest income gain on indemnification asset loans were sold on a non recourse basis to third parties 
the decline in loss on sale of covered loans for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  resulted from i improved pricing on the sale and ii the impact of sale of loans from the pool of residential aci loans with a carrying value of zero 
loans with an aggregate upb of million were sold from this pool in and the proceeds of million were recorded in interest income 
no loss was recorded in the consolidated financial statements on the sale of loans from this pool 
since reimbursements from the fdic under the loss sharing agreements are calculated based on upb of the loans rather than on their financial statement carrying amounts  the gain on indemnification asset recorded related to the sale of covered loans for includes a component related to the sale of loans from the zero carrying value pool 
historically  we have sold covered loans in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we anticipate that we will continue to exercise our right to sell covered loans in future periods  and depending on market conditions  expect to sell loans on a quarterly  rather than an annual basis 
additional impairment arising since the fsb acquisition related to covered loans is recorded in earnings through the provision for losses on covered loans 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the company is entitled to recover from the fdic a portion of losses on these loans  therefore  the discounted amount of additional expected cash flows from the fdic related to these losses is recorded in non interest income in the line item net gain loss on indemnification asset and reflected as a corresponding increase in the fdic indemnification asset 
alternatively  a recovery of the provision for loan losses related to covered loans results in a reduction in the amounts the company expects to recover from the fdic and a corresponding reduction in the fdic indemnification asset and in non interest income  reflected in the line item net gain loss on indemnification asset 
the company records impairment charges related to declines in the net realizable value of oreo properties subject to the loss sharing agreements and recognizes additional gains or losses upon the eventual sale of such oreo properties 
these amounts are included in non interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated increase or reduction in amounts recoverable from the fdic with respect to these gains and losses is reflected as an increase or decrease in the fdic indemnification asset and in non interest income in the line item net gain loss on indemnification asset 

table of contents net gain loss on indemnification asset of million  million and million was recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing the net change in the fdic indemnification asset from increases or decreases in cash flows estimated to be received from the fdic related to gains and losses from covered assets as discussed in the preceding paragraphs

such expenses are recorded in non interest expense when incurred  and the reimbursement is recorded as fdic reimbursement of costs of resolution of covered assets in non interest income when submitted to the fdic  generally upon ultimate resolution of the underlying covered assets 
this may result in the expense and the related income from reimbursements being 
table of contents recorded in different periods 
for the years ended december    and non interest expense included approximately million  million and million  respectively  of such expenses 
during the years ended december    and  claims of million  million  and million  respectively  were submitted to the fdic 
as of december   million of expenses incurred to date remained to be submitted for reimbursement from the fdic in future periods 
we expect the impact on non interest income of transactions in the covered assets to decline in future periods as these assets comprise a smaller percentage of our total assets 
other components of non interest income gains on the sale of investment securities available for sale during the year ended december  related primarily to the following we sold agency mortgage backed securities with an aggregate fair value of million and a combined effective yield of  utilizing the proceeds to extinguish million of fhlb advances and terminate a cash flow hedge with a combined cost of borrowing of 
we realized a gain on sale of these securities of million  a loss on extinguishment of the fhlb advances of million and a loss on termination of the cash flow hedge of million 
this transaction is expected to have a positive impact on our net interest margin in gains of million on the sale of financial institution preferred stocks resulted from a decision to reduce our level of exposure to this asset class 
we realized net gains of million from the liquidation of certain positions in asset backed securities  primarily student loan backed securities  in response to market developments 
mortgage insurance income represents mortgage insurance proceeds received with respect to covered loans in excess of the portion of losses on those loans that is recoverable from the fdic 
mortgage insurance proceeds up to the amount of losses on covered loans recoverable from the fdic offsets amounts otherwise reimbursable by the fdic 
decreases in mortgage insurance income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  resulted primarily from declines in the volume of claims being processed 
non interest income for the year ended december  included approximately million representing the settlement of a dispute with the fdic associated with the valuation established on certain investment securities at the time of the fsb acquisition 
other non interest income for the year ended december  included a gain of million on the acquisition of herald

table of contents non interest expense the following table presents the components of non interest expense for the years ended december   and in thousands employee compensation and benefits occupancy and equipment impairment of other real estate owned gain loss on sale of other real estate owned other real estate owned expense foreclosure expense change in value of fdic warrant deposit insurance expense professional fees telecommunications and data processing other non interest expense non interest expense as a percentage of average assets  excluding a million equity based compensation charge recorded in conjunction with the ipo in  was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the more significant components of non interest expense are discussed below 
employee compensation and benefits as is typical for financial institutions  employee compensation and benefits represents the single largest component of recurring non interest expense 
excluding the impact of the million equity based compensation charge recorded in conjunction with the ipo as discussed further below  employee compensation and benefits increased by million or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and by million  or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  these increases in employee compensation and benefits costs reflected growth and expansion of our operations and continued enhancement of our management team and supporting personnel 
we expect compensation and benefits costs to increase in as we expand our operations in the tri state area 
prior to the consummation of the ipo  our employee compensation and benefits expense included expense related to pius issued to certain members of executive management 
the pius were divided into two equal types of profits interests 
half of the pius  referred to as time based pius  vested with the passage of time following the grant date 
compensation expense related to time based pius was recorded on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on their fair value 
fair value of the time based pius was estimated using a black scholes option pricing model incorporating estimates of the per share value of our common stock and assumptions as to expected volatility  dividends  expected term  and risk free rates 
the remaining half of the pius  referred to as irr based pius  vested immediately prior to the consummation of the ipo and compensation expense related to the irr based pius was recorded at that time 
in conjunction with the ipo  the pius were exchanged for a combination of vested and unvested common shares and vested and unvested stock options 
the equity instruments issued in exchange for pius included  vested common shares  unvested common shares 
table of contents  vested stock options  unvested stock options the unvested instruments corresponded to the unvested time based pius and continued to vest according to the original vesting schedule of such time based pius 
the remainder of these instruments vested in at the time of the ipo  we recorded additional compensation expense of approximately million related to the vesting of the irr based pius and the adjustment of the fair value of the vested portion of time based pius 
this charge to compensation expense was offset by a credit to paid in capital and therefore did not impact the company capital position 
fair value of the pius at the date of the ipo was measured based on the fair value of the common shares and options for which they were exchanged 
the common shares were valued at the ipo price of fair value of the options was estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the valuation of these instruments 
employee compensation and benefits expense included million  million  inclusive of the million charge recorded in conjunction with the ipo  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to pius and instruments issued in exchange for pius 
occupancy and equipment occupancy and equipment expense increased by million or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and by million  or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  these increases related primarily to the expansion and refurbishment of our branch network and enhancements to our technology platforms including  for  certain costs related to three branches that we plan to open in manhattan in we expect occupancy and equipment costs to increase in as we expand our operations in the tri state area 
oreo and foreclosure related components of non interest expense at december  as well as during the years ended december   and  all of our oreo properties were covered by the loss sharing agreements 
therefore  any losses from sale or impairment of oreo were substantially offset by non interest income related to indemnification by the fdic 
generally  oreo and foreclosure related expenses are also reimbursed under the terms of the loss sharing agreements 
impairment of oreo declined by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decline resulted from a reduction in the level of oreo inventory and recovery in home prices during in contrast  deterioration in home prices led to an increase in impairment of oreo of million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  net gains on the sale of oreo totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to net losses on the sale of oreo of million for the year ended december  the impact of gains and losses on oreo sales declined in part because of a decline in the level of oreo sale activity 
as illustrated in the tables below  the percentage of total residential units sold at a gain increased in as compared to  the average gain on units sold at a gain increased  and the average loss on units sold at a loss declined  reflecting improvements in real estate values 

table of contents the following tables summarize oreo sale activity for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands units sold percent of total units total gain loss units sold percent of total units total gain loss residential oreo sales commercial oreo sales units sold percent of total units average gain or loss units sold percent of total units average gain or loss residential oreo sales units sold at a gain units sold at a loss the increase in net losses on sales of oreo for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted from deterioration in home prices and the high level of oreo sale activity in in total  foreclosure and oreo related expenses decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  these declines were primarily attributable to decreases in the levels of foreclosure activity and oreo inventory 
there were   and  residential units in the foreclosure pipeline and  and  residential units in oreo inventory at december   and  respectively 
loans are deemed eligible for foreclosure referral based on state specific guidelines  which is generally at days delinquency 
prior to referral  extensive reviews are performed to ensure that all collection and loss mitigation efforts have been exhausted 
we have performed an internal assessment of our foreclosure practices and procedures and of our vendor management processes related to outside vendors that assist us in the foreclosure process 
this assessment did not reveal any deficiencies in processes and procedures that we believe to be of significance 
other components of non interest expense other non interest expense for the year ended december  included the increase in value of a warrant issued to the fdic in conjunction with the fsb acquisition 
based on its initial terms  the value of the warrant  as defined  was based on the value the company realized in an ipo or exit event 
during  the company and the fdic amended the warrant to guarantee a minimum value to the fdic of million and recorded million of non interest expense to adjust the value of the warrant to the guaranteed minimum value 
in february  the company redeemed the fdic warrant for its agreed upon value of million in cash 
deposit insurance expense declined by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in  the fdic revised the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums 
the change in the assessment base coupled with the relatively low risk rating assigned to the bank resulted in a reduction of the bank premiums 

table of contents professional fees increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to legal and other professional fees incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of herald 
the primary components of other non interest expense are advertising and promotion  the cost of regulatory examinations  insurance  travel and general office expense 
period over period increases in other non interest expense related primarily to general organic growth of our business 
income taxes the provision for income taxes for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the company effective tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal tax rate of primarily due to the effect of state income taxes  non deductible equity based compensation expense  and particularly for the year ended december   the provision for uncertain state tax positions 
non deductible equity based compensation totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
non deductible equity based compensation related primarily to pius and the equity instruments for which pius were exchanged at the time of the ipo 
based on the nature of equity instruments currently outstanding  we expect the impact of non deductible compensation expense on the effective tax rate to be immaterial in future periods 
at december  and  the company had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had net deferred tax liabilities of million 
based on an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence related to ultimate realization of deferred tax assets  we have concluded it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
persuasive positive evidence leading to this conclusion as of december  includes the availability of sufficient tax loss carrybacks and future taxable income resulting from reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to assure realization of the deferred tax assets 
realization of deferred tax assets as of december  is not dependent  to any significant extent  on the generation of additional future taxable income 
for more information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
analysis of financial condition average interest earning assets increased billion to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  this increase was driven by a billion increase in the average balance of outstanding loans and a billion increase in average investment securities available for sale 
the increase in average loans reflected growth of billion in average new loans outstanding  partially offset by a billion decrease in the average balance of loans acquired in the fsb acquisition 
average non interest earning assets declined by million 
the most significant component of this decline was the decrease in the fdic indemnification asset from claims paid 
growth of the new loan portfolio  resolution of covered loans and declines in the amount of the fdic indemnification asset related to the payment of claims are trends that are expected to continue 
average interest bearing liabilities increased by million to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december   due primarily to an increase of million in average interest bearing deposits 
average non interest bearing deposits increased by million 
average stockholders equity increased by million  due largely to the retention of earnings 
to a lesser extent  the increase in average stockholders equity was impacted by the issuance of equity consideration in the acquisition of herald and an increase in unrealized gains on investment securities available for sale  offset by dividends paid

we were able to deploy more of these resources toward loan growth in our investment strategy has focused on providing liquidity necessary for day to day operations  adding a suitable balance of high credit quality  diversifying assets to the consolidated balance sheet  managing interest rate risk  and generating acceptable returns given our established risk parameters 
we have sought to maintain liquidity and manage interest rate risk by investing a significant portion of the portfolio in high quality liquid securities consisting primarily of us government agency floating rate mortgage backed securities 
we have also invested in highly rated structured products including private label residential and commercial mortgage backed securities  re remics  collateralized loan obligations and non mortgage asset backed securities collateralized by small balance commercial loans  auto loans  servicer advances and student loans as well as bank preferred stocks and us small business administration securities that  while somewhat less liquid  provide us with higher yields

table of contents as of december   of the non covered securities were backed by the us government  us government agencies or sponsored enterprises or were rated aaa 
all remaining non covered securities were investment grade 
the investment portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of million at december  with aggregate fair value equal to of amortized cost 
net unrealized gains included million of gross unrealized gains and million of gross unrealized losses 
securities in unrealized loss positions for months or more had an aggregate fair value of million representing less than of the fair value of the portfolio  with total unrealized losses of million at december  we evaluate the credit quality of individual securities in the portfolio quarterly to determine whether any of the investments in unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
this evaluation considers  but is not necessarily limited to  the following factors  the relative significance of which varies depending on the circumstances pertinent to each individual security our intent to hold the security until maturity or for a period of time sufficient for a recovery in value  whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than amortized cost  adverse changes in expected cash flows  collateral values and performance  the payment structure of the security  including levels of subordination or over collateralization  changes in the economic or regulatory environment  the general market condition of the geographic area or industry of the issuer  the issuer financial condition  performance and business prospects  and changes in credit ratings 
no securities were determined to be other than temporarily impaired during the years ended december   or the majority of the debt securities in unrealized loss positions at december  were characterized by low loan counts  odd lots  heightened prepayment speeds or low coupons  all factors which can put downward pressure on pricing 
we believe these characteristics to be consistent with temporary impairment 
we do not intend to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions 
based on an assessment of our liquidity position and internal and regulatory guidelines for permissible investments and concentrations  it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities in significant unrealized loss positions prior to recovery of amortized cost basis 
the severity and duration of impairment of individual securities in the portfolio is generally not material 
management either engaged a third party to perform  or performed internally  projected cash flow analyses of the private label mortgage backed securities  re remics and non mortgage asset backed securities  incorporating cusip level collateral default rate  voluntary prepayment rate  severity and delinquency assumptions 
based on the results of this analysis  no credit losses were projected 
given the expectation of timely repayment of principal and interest and the limited duration and severity of impairment  we concluded that none of the debt securities were other than temporarily impaired 
one equity security was in an unrealized loss position at december   given the limited severity of impairment  we considered the impairment of the equity security to be temporary 

table of contents for further discussion of our analysis of investment securities for other than temporary impairment  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we use third party pricing services to assist us in estimating the fair value of investment securities 
we perform a variety of procedures to ensure that we have a thorough understanding of the methodologies and assumptions used by the pricing services including obtaining and reviewing written documentation of the methods and assumptions employed  conducting interviews with valuation desk personnel  performing on site walkthroughs and reviewing model results and detailed assumptions used to value selected securities as considered necessary 
our classification of prices within the fair value hierarchy is based on an evaluation of the nature of the significant assumptions impacting the valuation of each type of security in the portfolio 
we have established a robust price challenge process that includes a review by our treasury front office of all prices provided on a monthly basis 
any price evidencing unexpected month over month fluctuations or deviations from our expectations based on recent observed trading activity and other information available in the marketplace that would impact the value of the security is challenged 
responses to the price challenges  which generally include specific information about inputs and assumptions incorporated in the valuation and their sources  are reviewed in detail 
if considered necessary to resolve any discrepancies  a price will be obtained from an additional independent valuation specialist 
we do not typically adjust the prices provided  other than through this established challenge process 
our primary pricing services utilize observable inputs when available  and employ unobservable inputs and proprietary models only when observable inputs are not available 
as a matter of course  the services validate prices by comparison to recent trading activity whenever such activity exists 
quotes obtained from the pricing services are typically non binding 
we have also established a quarterly price validation process whereby we verify the prices provided by our primary pricing service for a sample of securities in the portfolio 
sample sizes vary based on the type of security being priced  with higher sample sizes applied to more difficult to value security types 
verification procedures may consist of obtaining prices from an additional outside source or internal modeling  generally based on intex 
we have established acceptable percentage deviations from the price provided by the initial pricing source 
if deviations fall outside the established parameters  we will obtain and evaluate more detailed information about the assumptions and inputs used by each pricing source or  if considered necessary  employ an additional valuation specialist to price the security in question 
when there are price discrepancies  the final determination of fair value is based on careful consideration of the assumptions and inputs employed by each of the pricing sources given our knowledge of the market for each individual security and may include interviews with the outside pricing sources utilized 
depending on the results of the validation process  sample sizes may be extended for particular classes of securities 
results of the validation process are reviewed by the treasury front office and by senior management 
the majority of our investment securities are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
certain preferred stocks and us treasury securities are classified within level of the hierarchy 
at december  and december   and  respectively  of our investment securities were classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
securities classified within level of the hierarchy at december  included certain private label residential mortgage backed securities and trust preferred securities 
substantially all of the private label residential mortgage backed securities and all of the trust preferred securities were covered securities 
these securities were classified within level of the hierarchy because proprietary assumptions related to voluntary prepayment rates  default probabilities and loss severities were considered significant to the valuation 
during  certain private label residential mortgage backed securities and non mortgage asset backed securities were transferred from level to level of the fair value hierarchy 
activity in the market for these securities had increased such that unobservable inputs were no longer significant to the valuation process

at december    and respectively    and of loans  net of premiums  discounts  deferred fees and costs  were covered loans 
covered loans are declining and new loans increasing as a percentage of the total portfolio as covered loans are repaid or resolved and new loan originations and purchases increase 
this trend is expected to continue 
residential mortgages historically  residential mortgages  including single family residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit  represented the majority of the total loan portfolio 
consistent with our strategy of emphasizing commercial loan production  this portfolio segment has declined as a percentage of total loans 
residential mortgages totaled billion  or of total loans and billion  or of total loans at december  and  respectively 
the decline in this portfolio segment as a percentage of loans is a result of the resolution of covered loans  including transfers to oreo  partially offset by residential loan purchases and an emphasis on commercial loan origination 
the new residential loan portfolio includes both originated and purchased loans 
at december  and  million or and million or  respectively  of our new single family residential loans were originated loans  million or and million or of our new single family residential loans were purchased loans 
we currently originate single 
table of contents family residential mortgage loans with terms ranging from to years  with either fixed or adjustable interest rates  primarily to customers in the state of florida 
new residential mortgage loans are primarily closed end first lien loans for the purchase or re finance of owner occupied property 
we have purchased loans to supplement our mortgage origination platform and to geographically diversify our loan portfolio 
the purchased residential portfolio consists primarily of jumbo mortgages on owner occupied properties

we intend to expand and enhance our residential origination channel in the number of newly originated residential mortgage loans that are re financings of covered loans is not significant 
home equity loans and lines of credit are not significant to the new loan portfolio 
we do not originate option adjustable rate mortgages arms  no doc or reduced doc mortgages and do not utilize wholesale mortgage origination channels although the covered loan portfolio contains loans with these characteristics 
all of these loans are covered loans  therefore  the company exposure to future losses on these mortgage loans is mitigated by the loss sharing agreements

all of the option arms are covered loans and the substantial majority are aci loans 
the aci loans are accounted for in accordance with asc  therefore  the optionality embedded in these loans does not impact the carrying value of the loans or the amount of interest income recognized on them 
these features are taken into account in quarterly updates of expected cash flows from these loans

commercial real estate loans include term loans secured by owner and non owner occupied income producing properties including rental apartments  industrial properties  retail shopping centers  office buildings  warehouses and hotels as well as real estate secured lines of credit 
loans secured by commercial real estate typically have shorter repayment periods and re price more frequently than single family residential loans 
the company underwriting standards generally provide for loan terms of five years  with amortization schedules of no more than twenty five years 
loan to value ltv ratios are typically limited to no more than 
in addition  the company usually obtains personal guarantees of the principals as additional security for commercial real estate loans 
at december   the upb of construction loans with available interest reserves totaled million  the amount of available interest reserves totaled million 
all of these loans were rated pass at december  commercial loans are typically made to growing companies and middle market businesses and include equipment loans  working capital lines of credit  asset backed loans  acquisition finance credit facilities  lease financing and small business administration product offerings 
these loans may be structured as term loans  typically with maturities of five years or less  or revolving lines of credit which typically mature annually 
lease financing consists of municipal and business equipment financing leases

new loans were underwritten under significantly different and generally more conservative standards than the covered loans 
in particular  credit approval policies have been strengthened  wholesale mortgage origination channels have been eliminated  no doc and option arm loan products have been eliminated  and real estate appraisal policies have been improved 
although the risk profile of covered loans is higher than that of new loans  our exposure to loss related to the covered loans is significantly mitigated by the loss sharing agreements and by the fair value basis recorded in these loans resulting from the application of acquisition accounting 
we have established a robust credit risk management framework and put in place an experienced team to lead the workout and recovery process for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios 
we have also implemented a dedicated internal loan review function that reports directly to our audit committee 
we have an experienced resolution team in place for covered residential mortgage loans  and have implemented outsourcing arrangements with industry leading firms in certain areas such as oreo resolution 
loan performance is monitored by our credit administration  workout and recovery and loan review departments 
commercial loans are regularly reviewed by our internal loan review department 
relationships with committed balances greater than  are reviewed at least annually 
the company utilizes a grade internal asset risk classification system as part of its efforts to monitor and improve commercial asset quality 
loans exhibiting potential credit weaknesses that deserve management close attention and that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment capacity of the borrower are categorized as special mention 
these borrowers may exhibit negative financial trends or erratic financial performance  strained liquidity  marginal collateral coverage  declining industry trends or weak management 
loans with well defined credit weaknesses that may result in a loss if the deficiencies are not corrected are assigned a risk rating of substandard 
these borrowers may exhibit payment defaults  insufficient cash flows  operating losses  increasing balance sheet leverage  project cost overruns  unreasonable construction delays  exhausted interest reserves  or declining collateral values 
loans with weaknesses so severe that collection in full is highly questionable 
table of contents or improbable  but because of certain reasonably specific pending factors have not been charged off  are assigned risk ratings of doubtful 
residential mortgage loans and consumer loans are not individually risk rated 
delinquency status is the primary measure we use to monitor the credit quality of these loans 
we also consider original ltv and fico score to be significant indicators of credit quality for the new single family residential portfolio 
new loans commercial the ongoing asset quality of significant commercial loans is monitored on an individual basis through our regular credit review and risk rating process 
we believe internal risk rating is the best indicator of the credit quality of commercial loans 
homogenous groups of smaller balance commercial loans may be monitored collectively 
at december   new commercial loans with aggregate balances of million  million and million were rated special mention  substandard and doubtful  respectively 
at december   new commercial loans aggregating million were rated special mention and new commercial loans aggregating million were classified substandard or doubtful 
residential at december   new single family residential loans totaling million were days or more past due 
all of these loans were acquired in partial satisfaction of a commercial debt previously contracted 
new single family residential loans past due less than days totaled million at december  at december   no new single family residential loans were days or more past due 
new single family residential loans past due less than days totaled million at december  past due home equity loans and lines of credit in the new portfolio were not significant at december  or at december   of the new home equity portfolio were first liens  and were second or third liens 
the majority of our new residential mortgage portfolio consists of purchased loans 
the credit parameters for purchasing loans are similar to the underwriting guidelines in place for our mortgage origination platform 
for purchasing seasoned loans  good payment history is required 
in general  we purchase performing jumbo mortgage pools which have average fico scores above  primarily are owner occupied and full documentation  and have a current ltv of less than 
we perform due diligence on the purchased loans for credit  compliance  counterparty  payment history and property valuation 
the following table shows the distribution of new single family residential loans by original fico and ltv as of december  and in thousands fico fico ltv or less or greater total or less or greater total or less or more 
table of contents at december   the purchased loan portfolio had the following characteristics were fixed rate loans  substantially all were full documentation with an average fico score of and average ltv of 
the majority of this portfolio was owner occupied  with primary residence  second homes and investment properties 
in terms of vintage  of the portfolio was originated pre  in  in  in  in and in similarly  the originated loan portfolio had the following characteristics at december  were fixed rate loans  were full documentation with an average fico score of and average ltv of 
the majority of this portfolio was owner occupied  with primary residence and second home 
in terms of vintage  of the portfolio was originated in  in  in and in consumer the largest segment of the new consumer portfolio at december  was indirect auto loans 
delinquent consumer loans in the new portfolio were insignificant as of december  and covered loans covered loans consist of both aci loans and non aci loans 
at december   covered aci loans totaled billion and covered non aci loans totaled million  net of premiums  discounts  deferred fees and costs 
residential covered residential loans were placed into homogenous pools at the time of the fsb acquisition and the ongoing credit quality and performance of these loans is monitored on a pool basis 
the fair value of the pools was initially measured based on the expected cash flows from each pool 
initial cash flow expectations incorporated significant assumptions regarding prepayment rates  frequency of default and loss severity 
for aci pools  the difference between total contractual payments due and the cash flows expected to be received at acquisition was recognized as non accretable difference 
the excess of expected cash flows over the recorded fair value of each aci pool at acquisition  known as the accretable yield  is being recognized as interest income over the life of each pool 
we monitor the pools quarterly to determine whether any significant changes have occurred in expected cash flows that would be indicative of impairment or necessitate reclassification between non accretable difference and accretable yield 
generally  improvements in expected cash flows less than of the expected cash flows from a pool are not recorded 
this materiality threshold may be revised in the future based on management judgment 
residential mortgage loans  including home equity loans  comprised of the upb of the acquired loan portfolio at the fsb acquisition date 
we performed a detailed analysis of the portfolio to determine the key loan characteristics influencing performance 
key characteristics influencing the performance of the residential mortgage portfolio  including home equity loans  were determined to be delinquency status  product type  in particular  amortizing as opposed to option arm products  current indexed ltv ratio  and original fico score 
the aci loans in the residential mortgage portfolio were grouped into ten homogenous static pools based on these characteristics  and the non aci residential loans were grouped into two homogenous static pools 
there were other variables which we initially expected to have a significant influence on performance and which were considered in our analysis  however  the results of our analysis demonstrated that their impact was less significant after controlling for current indexed ltv  product type  and fico score 
therefore  these additional factors were not used in grouping the covered residential loans into pools and are not used in monitoring ongoing asset quality of the pools 
the factors we considered but determined not to be significant included the level 
table of contents and type of documentation required at origination  ie  whether a loan was originated under full documentation  reduced documentation  or no documentation programs  occupancy  defined as owner occupied vs 
non owner occupied collateral properties  geography  and vintage  ie  year of origination 
at december   the carrying value of single family residential non aci loans was million  million or of these loans were days or more past due and million or were days or more past due 
at december   aci single family residential loans totaled billion  million or of these loans were delinquent by days or more and million or were delinquent by days or more 
at december   non aci home equity loans and lines of credit had an aggregate carrying value of million  million or of these loans were days or more past due and million or were days or more past due 
aci home equity loans and lines of credit had a carrying amount of million at december  at december   million or of aci home equity loans and lines of credit were days or more contractually delinquent and million or were delinquent by days or more 
at december   and  respectively  of the non aci and aci home equity loans and lines of credit were first liens while and  respectively  of the non aci and aci home equity loans and lines of credit were second or third liens 
expected loss severity given default is significantly higher for home equity loans that are not first liens 
although delinquencies in the covered residential portfolio are high  potential future losses to the company related to these loans are significantly mitigated by the loss sharing agreements 
commercial generally  commercial and commercial real estate loans are monitored individually due to their size and other unique characteristics 
at december   non aci commercial loans had an aggregate upb of million and a carrying value of million  of these loans were rated pass and this portfolio segment has limited delinquency history 
at december   non aci commercial loans with aggregate carrying values of million and million were rated substandard and doubtful  respectively 
at december   there were no non aci commercial loans rated special mention 
at december   aci commercial loans had a carrying value of million  of which million are covered under the loss sharing agreements 
at december   loans with aggregate carrying values of million  million and million were internally risk rated special mention  substandard and doubtful  respectively 
potential future losses to the company related to the covered loans are significantly mitigated by the loss sharing agreements 
impaired loans and non performing assets non performing assets consist of i non accrual loans  including loans that have been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring tdr and placed on nonaccrual status or that have not yet exhibited a consistent six month payment history  ii accruing loans that are more than days contractually past due as to interest or principal  excluding aci loans  and iii oreo 
impaired loans also include loans modified in tdrs that are performing according to their modified terms  aci loans for which expected cash flows have been revised downward since acquisition  and one accruing loan identified as impaired due to a potential collateral shortfall 
because of accretable yield  impaired aci loans have not been classified as nonaccrual loans and we do not consider them to be non performing assets 
historically and as of december   the substantial majority of non performing assets were covered assets 
the company exposure to loss related to covered assets is significantly mitigated by 
table of contents the loss sharing agreements and by the fair value basis recorded in these assets resulting from the application of acquisition accounting

total loans for purposes of calculating these ratios is net of premiums  discounts  deferred fees and costs 
all impaired loans and non performing assets were covered assets at december  contractually delinquent aci loans are not reflected as nonaccrual loans because accretable yield continues to be accreted into income 
accretable yield continues to be recorded as there continues to 
table of contents be an expectation of future cash flows in excess of carrying amount from these loans 
the carrying value of aci loans contractually delinquent by more than days but on which income was still being recognized was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decline in the ratio of the alll to total loans  particularly for the new portfolio  at december  as compared to december  is primarily a result of a decrease in the peer group loss factors used in calculating the alll for the commercial portfolio 
see the section entitled analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses below for a further discussion of the methodology we use to determine the amount of the alll 
the ratio of non performing new loans to total new loans was a low at december   but increased from at december  this increase is not unexpected as the new portfolio begins to season 
the decline in the ratio of non performing assets to total assets at december  as compared to december  was primarily attributable to the decrease in oreo 
new and non aci commercial loans are placed on non accrual status when i management has determined that full repayment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt  or ii the loan is past due days or more as to principal or interest unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
new and non aci residential and consumer loans are generally placed on non accrual status when days of interest is due and unpaid 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  uncollected interest accrued is reversed and charged to interest income 
commercial loans are returned to accrual status only after all past due principal and interest has been collected and full repayment of remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured 
residential loans are returned to accrual status when less than days of interest is due and unpaid 
past due status of loans is determined based on the contractual next payment due date 
loans less than days past due are reported as current 
except for aci loans accounted for in pools  loans that are the subject of troubled debt restructurings are generally placed on nonaccrual status at the time of the modification unless the borrower has no history of missed payments for six months prior to the restructuring 
if borrowers perform pursuant to the modified loan terms for at least six months and the remaining loan balances are considered collectable  the loans are returned to accrual status 
a loan modification is considered a tdr if the company  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower that the company would not otherwise grant 
these concessions may take the form of temporarily or permanently reduced interest rates  payment abatement periods  restructuring of payment terms  extensions of maturity at below market terms  or in some cases  partial forgiveness of principal 
under generally accepted accounting principles  modified aci loans accounted for in pools are not accounted for as troubled debt restructurings and are not separated from their respective pools when modified 
included in tdrs are loans to consumer borrowers who have not reaffirmed their debt discharged in chapter bankruptcy 
the total amount of such loans is not significant 
to date  tdrs have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
as of december  impaired loans included commercial relationships with an aggregate carrying value of million and residential loans with an aggregate carrying value of million that had been modified in tdrs 
substantially all of the residential tdrs were modified under the us treasury department home affordable modification program hamp 
because of the immateriality of the amount of loans modified in tdrs and nature of the modifications  the modifications did not have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   or for additional information about tdrs  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additional interest income that would have been recognized on nonaccrual loans and tdrs had they performed in accordance with their original contractual terms is not material for any period presented 

table of contents potential problem loans potential problem loans have been identified by management as those loans included in the substandard accruing risk rating category 
these loans are typically performing  but possess specifically identified credit weaknesses that  if not remedied  may lead to a downgrade to non accrual status and identification as impaired in the near term 
substandard accruing loans totaled million at december  the majority of these loans were current as to principal and interest at december  loss mitigation strategies we evaluate each loan in default to determine the most effective loss mitigation strategy  which may be modification  short sale  or foreclosure 
we offer loan modifications under hamp to eligible borrowers in the residential portfolio 
hamp is a uniform loan modification process that provides eligible borrowers with sustainable monthly mortgage payments equal to a target of their gross monthly income 
as of december    borrowers had been counseled regarding their participation in hamp   of those borrowers were initially determined to be potentially eligible for loan modifications under the program 
as of december    borrowers who did not elect to participate in the program had been sent termination letters and  borrowers had been denied due to ineligibility 
at december   there were  permanent loan modifications 
substantially all of these modified loans were aci loans accounted for in pools 
analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses the alll relates to i new loans  ii estimated additional losses arising on non aci loans subsequent to the fsb acquisition  and iii additional impairment recognized as a result of decreases in expected cash flows on aci loans due to further credit deterioration 
the impact of any additional provision for losses on covered loans is significantly mitigated by an increase in the fdic indemnification asset 
the determination of the amount of the alll is  by nature  highly complex and subjective 
future events that are inherently uncertain could result in material changes to the level of the alll 
general economic conditions such as unemployment rates  real estate values in our primary market areas and the level of interest rates  as well as a variety of other factors that affect the ability of borrowers businesses to generate cash flows sufficient to service their debts will impact the future performance of the portfolio 
new and non aci loans based on an analysis of historical performance of the non aci residential mortgage and home equity portfolio  oreo and short sale losses and recent trending data  we have concluded that ltv ratio is the leading predictive indicator of loss severity for this portfolio 
the non aci residential mortgage and home equity portfolios have therefore been divided into homogenous groups and stratified based on ltv for purposes of calculating the alll 
calculated frequency of roll to loss and severity percentages are applied to the dollar value of loans in each group to calculate an overall loss allowance 
ltv ratios at the individual loan level are updated quarterly using the appropriate case shiller quarterly msa home price index to adjust the original appraised value of the underlying collateral 
frequency is calculated for each group using a four month roll to loss percentage  based on the assumption that if an event has occurred with a borrower that will ultimately result in a loss  this will manifest itself as a loan in default and in process of foreclosure within four months 
loss severity given default is estimated based on internal data about oreo sales and short sales from the portfolio 
the alll calculation incorporates a loss severity assumption for home equity loans that are projected to roll to default 
although the population remains insignificant  management continues to analyze the impact of senior lien delinquency on the allowance estimates of performing subordinate 
table of contents liens 
at december   the non aci home equity loss factor reflects elevated default probabilities as a result of delinquent  related senior liens 
due to the lack of similarity between the risk characteristics of new loans and covered loans in the residential and home equity portfolios  management does not believe it is appropriate to use the historical performance of the covered residential mortgage portfolio as a basis for calculating the alll applicable to new loans 
the new loan portfolio is not seasoned and has not yet developed an observable loss trend 
therefore  the alll for new residential loans is based primarily on peer group average historical loss rates as discussed further below 
since the new commercial loan portfolio is not yet seasoned enough to exhibit a loss trend and the non aci commercial portfolio has limited delinquency history  the alll for new and non aci commercial loans is based primarily on the company internal credit risk rating system and peer group average historical loss rates by loan class 
the allowance is comprised of specific reserves for significant classified loans that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired as well as general reserves for individually evaluated loans determined not to be impaired and loans that do not meet our established threshold for individual evaluation 
commercial relationships graded substandard or doubtful and on nonaccrual status with committed credit facilities greater than or equal to  are individually evaluated for impairment 
a net realizable value analysis is prepared quarterly for each of these relationships 
this analysis forms the basis for establishing specific reserves 
loans modified in tdrs are also evaluated individually for impairment 
we believe that loans rated substandard or doubtful that are not individually evaluated for impairment exhibit characteristics indicative of a heightened level of credit risk 
we group these loans by product type and risk rating and establish general reserve percentages based on estimated probability of default and loss severity 
these estimates are based on available industry data 
the peer group used to calculate the average historical loss rates that form the basis for our general reserve calculations is a group of banks in the us southeast region determined by management to be the most comparable to bankunited 
factors that impacted the selection of the peer group included asset size  composition of the loan portfolio and credit quality ratios  including net charge offs to average loans  alll to total loans  alll to noncurrent loans and noncurrent loans to total loans 
peer bank data is obtained from the statistics on depository institutions report published by the fdic for the most recent quarter available 
for new loans  a six quarter average of peer group historical loss rates is used as this period corresponds to the vintage of the majority of loans in this portfolio segment 
for the non aci portfolio  a twelve quarter average of peer group historical loss rates is used as this period is considered more representative of expected loss experience for the more seasoned loans in this segment 
our internal risk rating system comprises credit grades  grades through are pass grades 
the risk ratings are driven largely by debt service coverage 
peer group average historical loss rates are adjusted upward for loans rated special mention or assigned a lower pass rating 
peer group average historical loss rates are adjusted downward for loans assigned the highest pass grades 
qualitative adjustments are made to the alll when  based on management judgment and experience  there are internal or external factors impacting loss frequency and severity not taken into account by the quantitative calculations 
management has categorized potential qualitative adjustments into the following categories portfolio trends  including levels of delinquencies and non performing loans  portfolio growth rates  policy and credit guidelines  including changes in credit administration management and staff and the level of policy and procedural exceptions  
table of contents economic factors  including changes in and levels of real estate price indices  unemployment rates and gdp  and credit concentrations 
at december   qualitative adjustments were made to historical loss percentages related to economic factors  including unemployment rates  levels of real estate prices and gdp  portfolio trends  in particular the portfolio growth rate  and policy and credit guidelines  related to procedural exceptions 
qualitative adjustments represented approximately of the total new and non aci alll at december  for non aci loans  the allowance is initially calculated based on upb 
the total of upb  less the calculated allowance  is then compared to the carrying amount of the loans  net of unamortized credit related fair value adjustments established at acquisition 
if the calculated balance net of the allowance is less than the carrying amount  an additional allowance is established 
any such increase in the allowance for non aci loans will result in a corresponding increase in the fdic indemnification asset 
the herald portfolio was acquired on february  and recorded at estimated fair value at that date 
an alll is provided for loans originated since acquisition using a methodology substantially consistent with that discussed above 
an alll is provided for acquired loans if  in management judgment  there are indications that credit quality has deteriorated since acquisition 
as of december   the herald loan portfolio has not had a material impact on our analysis of the alll 
aci loans for aci loans  a valuation allowance is established when periodic evaluations of expected cash flows reflect a decrease resulting from credit related factors from the level of cash flows that were estimated to be collected at acquisition plus any additional expected cash flows arising from revisions in those estimates 
we perform a quarterly analysis of expected cash flows for aci loans 
expected cash flows are estimated on a pool basis for aci single family residential and home equity loans 
the analysis of expected pool cash flows incorporates updated pool level expected prepayment rate  default rate  delinquency level and loss severity given default assumptions 
prepayment  delinquency and default curves are derived primarily from roll rates generated from the historical performance of the portfolio over the immediately preceding four quarters 
estimates of default probability and loss severity given default also incorporate updated ltv ratios  at the loan level  based on case shiller home price indices for the relevant msa 
costs and fees represent an additional component of loss on default and are projected using the making home affordable cost factors provided by the federal government 
the aci home equity roll rates reflect elevated default probabilities as a result of delinquent  related senior liens and loans to borrowers who have not reaffirmed their debt discharged in chapter bankruptcy 
based on our projected cash flow analysis  no alll related to single family residential and home equity aci pools was recorded at december  or during the year ended december   we recorded a reversal of a million allowance established at december  related to aci residential pools  along with a reversal of the related increase in the fdic indemnification asset of million and a provision for loan losses of million  along with a corresponding increase in the fdic indemnification asset of million  related to pooled home equity aci loans 
due to improved performance of and projected cash flows from the home equity 
table of contents aci pool during  the allowance established related to this pool in  along with the corresponding increase in the fdic indemnification asset  were reversed in the primary assumptions underlying estimates of expected cash flows for aci commercial loans are default probability and severity of loss given default 
updated assumptions for large balance and delinquent loans in the commercial aci portfolio are based on net realizable value analyses prepared at the individual loan level by the company workout and recovery department 
updated assumptions for smaller balance commercial loans are based on a combination of the company own historical delinquency and severity data and industry level data 
delinquency data is used as a proxy for defaults as the company experience has been that few of these loans return to performing status after being delinquent greater than days 
an additional multiplier is applied to the portfolio level default probability in developing assumptions for loans rated special mention  substandard  or doubtful based on the company historical delinquency experience 
based on our loan level analysis  we recorded provisions for recoveries of loan losses on aci commercial loans of million  million and million respectively  for the years ended december   and related increases decreases in the fdic indemnification asset of million  million and million were recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively

stockholders equity increased million  or  from billion at december  to billion at december  the federal reserve board and occ regulate all capital distributions by bankunited and herald to the parent 
all quarterly applications to regulatory authorities for the payment of dividends to date have been approved 
pursuant to the fdia  the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations setting forth a five tier system for measuring the capital adequacy of the financial institutions they supervise 
at december  and december   bankunited  herald and the company had capital levels that exceeded the well capitalized guidelines 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the company regulatory capital ratios and requirements 
liquidity liquidity involves our ability to generate adequate funds to support asset growth  meet deposit withdrawal and other contractual obligations  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise conduct ongoing operations 
bankunited liquidity needs are primarily met by growth in transaction deposit accounts  its cash position  cash flow from its amortizing investment and loan portfolios and reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements 
if necessary  bankunited has the ability to raise liquidity through collateralized borrowings  fhlb advances or the sale of available for sale securities 
the asset liability committee alco policy has established several measures of liquidity which are monitored monthly by alco and quarterly by the board of directors 
the primary measure of liquidity monitored by management is liquid assets defined as cash and cash equivalents and pledgeable securities to total assets 
bankunited liquidity is considered acceptable if liquid assets divided by total assets exceeds 
at december   bankunited liquid assets divided by total assets was 
management monitors a one year liquidity ratio  defined as cash and cash equivalents  pledgeable securities  unused borrowing capacity at the fhlb  and loans and non agency securities maturing within one year divided by deposits and borrowings maturing within one year 
the maturity of deposits  excluding certificate of deposits  is based on retention rates derived from the most recent external core deposit analysis obtained by the company 
this ratio allows management to monitor liquidity over a longer time horizon 
at december   bankunited exceeded the acceptable limit established by alco for this ratio 
additional measures of liquidity regularly monitored by alco include the ratio of fhlb advances to tier capital plus the alll  the ratio of fhlb advances to total assets and a measure of available liquidity to volatile liabilities 
at december   bankunited was within acceptable limits established by alco for each of these measures 
as a holding company  bankunited  inc is a corporation separate and apart from our banking subsidiaries  and therefore  provides for its own liquidity 
bankunited  inc main sources of funds include management fees and dividends from its subsidiaries and access to capital markets 
there are regulatory limitations that affect the ability of bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to bankunited  inc management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short term cash obligations 
we expect that our liquidity requirements will continue to be met by operations and we intend to satisfy our liquidity requirements over the next months through these sources of funds 

table of contents interest rate risk the principal component of the company risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments  or market risk  is interest rate risk  including the risk that assets and liabilities with similar re pricing characteristics may not reprice at the same time or to the same degree 
the primary objective of the company asset liability management activities is to maximize net interest income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk 
the alco is responsible for establishing policies to limit exposure to interest rate risk  and to ensure procedures are established to monitor compliance with these policies 
the guidelines established by alco are reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
management believes that the simulation of net interest income in different interest rate environments provides the most meaningful measure of interest rate risk 
income simulation analysis is designed to capture not only the potential of all assets and liabilities to mature or reprice  but also the probability that they will do so 
income simulation also attends to the relative interest rate sensitivities of these items  and projects their behavior over an extended period of time 
finally  income simulation permits management to assess the probable effects on the balance sheet not only of changes in interest rates  but also of proposed strategies for responding to them 
the income simulation model analyzes interest rate sensitivity by projecting net interest income over the next twenty four months in a most likely rate scenario based on forward interest rate curves versus net interest income in alternative rate scenarios 
management continually reviews and refines its interest rate risk management process in response to the changing economic climate 
currently  our model projects a plus  plus and plus basis point change with rates increasing basis points per month until the applicable limit is reached as well as a modified flat scenario incorporating a more flattened yield curve 
we did not simulate a decrease in interest rates at december  due to the extremely low rate environment 
the company alco policy has established that interest income sensitivity will be considered acceptable if forecast net interest income in the plus basis point scenario is within of forecast net interest income in the most likely rate scenario over the next twelve months and within in the second year 
the following table illustrates the impact on forecasted net interest income of a plus basis points scenario at december  and plus december  twelve months twenty four months december  twelve months twenty four months management also simulates changes in the economic value of equity eve in various interest rate environments 
the alco policy has established parameters of acceptable risk that are defined in terms of the percentage change in eve from a base scenario under six rate scenarios  derived by implementing immediate parallel movements of plus and minus  and basis points from current rates 
we did not simulate decreases in interest rates at december  due to the current low rate environment 
the parameters established by alco stipulate that the change in eve is considered acceptable if the change is less than  and in plus  and basis point scenarios  respectively 
as of december   our simulation indicated percentage changes from base eve of  and in plus   and basis point scenarios  respectively 

table of contents these measures fall within an acceptable level of interest rate risk per the policies established by alco 
in the event the models indicate an unacceptable level of risk  the company could undertake a number of actions that would reduce this risk  including the sale of a portion of its available for sale investment portfolio or the use of risk management strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps 
many assumptions were used by the company to calculate the impact of changes in interest rates  including the change in rates 
actual results may not be similar to the company projections due to several factors including the timing and frequency of rate changes  market conditions and the shape of the yield curve 
actual results may also differ due to the company actions  if any  in response to the changing rates 
derivative financial instruments interest rate swaps are one of the tools we use to manage interest rate risk 
these derivative instruments are used to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates on fhlb advances and time deposits 
these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedging instruments 
the fair value of these instruments is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges had an aggregate notional amount of million 
the aggregate fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges included in other liabilities at december  was million 
interest rate swaps not designated as cash flow hedges had an aggregate notional amount of million at december  the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swaps included in other assets was million and the aggregate fair value included in other liabilities was million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements commitments we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit to our customers  including commitments to fund loans or lines of credit and commercial and standby letters of credit 
the credit risk associated with these commitments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and they are subject to our normal credit policies and approval processes 
while these commitments represent contractual cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
the following table details our outstanding commitments to extend credit as of december  in thousands covered non covered total commitments to fund loans commitments to purchase loans unfunded commitments under lines of credit commercial and standby letters of credit
