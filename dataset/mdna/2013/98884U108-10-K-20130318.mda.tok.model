to recap results for in thousands our revenue grew from  in to  in ifrogz  which was acquired by zagg on june   contributed  to the and  to the revenue balances 
in addition to a full year of sales from ifrogz  our sales growth in was the result of continued strong demand from customers in our indirect channel category from existing and new distribution partners  and the continued growth of the invisibleshield product line  coupled with strong growth of the company s keyboard  audio  and case product lines 
sales of invisibleshield products accounted for approximately of total sales in and approximately of total sales in  which represents an increase in total dollar sales year over year 
sales of keyboard products accounted for approximately of our total sales in and approximately of total sales in our sales through our website and through our mall kiosk program also increased over our gross profit grew from  in to  in gross profit as a percent of revenue remained relatively flat at in and our consistent gross profit percentage is primarily the result of year over year changes in acquisition related charges  and in operational decisions made to meet customer needs and grow our business 
during  management incurred charges through cost of sales related to the write up of ifrogz inventory at acquisition 
these charges all occurred in  and thus decreased gross profit compared to this was offset by the following items that decreased gross profit during compared to an increase airfreight shipping costs incurred during primarily linked to product releases  the continued product sales mix shift  as a higher percentage of our total sales were generated by lower margin products such as our keyboard  audio  and case products compared to prior years where a higher percentage of sales were generated by our invisibleshield products  our highest margin products  and the continued channel sales mix shift as sales through indirect channels continue to grow  which are at lower margins than website sales directly to the consumer 
our operating income increased by from  in to  in our operating margin percentage decreased from in to in the decrease in operating margin was due primarily to an  non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and an intangible trademark asset recorded during the fourth quarter of  charges incurred related to the departure of former ceo  robert pedersen ii  and an increase in compensation expense related to increased headcount and compensation adjustments for key executives 
these charges were partially offset by charges incurred during that did not recur in including  in cost incurred related to the acquisition of ifrogz  and an impairment of  recorded on a note receivable 
our full year fully diluted earnings per share attributable to stockholders decreased by over the decrease is primarily related to the  non cash charge recorded during the fourth quarter of to impair goodwill and an intangible trademark asset

we intend for the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies in thousands the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserve  sales returns liability  the useful life of property and equipment  the useful life of intangible assets  the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  the fair value of the investment in hzo  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably may have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company s revenue is derived from sales of our products through our indirect channel  including retailers and distributors  through our direct channel including www 
zagg 
com  www 
ifrogz 
com  and our corporate owned and third party owned mall kiosks  and from the fees derived from the sale of exclusive independent distributor licenses related to the kiosk program 
for sales of product  our standard shipping terms are fob shipping point  and we record revenue when the product is shipped  net of estimated returns and discounts 
for some customers  the contractual shipping terms are fob destination 
for these shipments  we record revenue when the product is delivered  net of estimated returns and discounts 
for license fees  we recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the license term 
the company records revenue from royalty agreements in the period in which the royalty is earned 
promotional products given to customers or potential customers are recognized as a cost of sales 
cash incentives provided to our customers are recognized as a reduction of the related sale price  and  therefore  are a reduction in sales 
reserve for sales returns and warranty liability for product sales  the company records revenue  net of estimated returns and discounts  when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
our return policy generally allows its end users and retailers to return purchased products 
in addition  the company generally provides the ultimate consumer a warranty with each product 
due to the nature of the invisibleshield product line  returns for the invisibleshield are generally not salvageable and are not included in inventory 
we estimate a reserve for sales returns and warranty and record the estimated reserve amount as a reduction of sales  and as a sales return reserve liability 
the estimate for sales returns and warranty requires management to make significant estimates regarding return rates for sales and warranty returns 
historical experience  actual claims  and customer return rights are the key factors used in determining the estimated sales return and warranty reserve 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customary credit terms to our customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and judgments as to expected collectability of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
valuation of note receivable we engaged independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of collateral of the note receivable 
such valuations require significant estimates and assumptions 
management determined the value of the shares of zagg common stock held by mr 
harmer based on quoted market prices 
the real estate holdings securing the note receivable were valued primarily based on the sales comparison approach as sales of comparable properties were utilized 
the investments in real estate companies were valued utilizing comparable market sales  a discounted cash flow analysis  and other appropriate valuation methodologies 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
inventories in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and to compare these with current inventory levels 
when the market value of inventory is less than the carrying value  the inventory cost is written down to the estimated net realizable value thereby establishing a new cost basis 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
income taxes deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized based on our estimate of future taxable income 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to establish a valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
the company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
the determination of the realization of certain income tax positions is subject to significant estimates based upon the facts and circumstances of each position 
long lived assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property and equipment  definite lived intangibles  indefinite lived intangibles  an investment in hzo an entity engaged in the development of water blocking technologies for consumer and industrial applications  and goodwill 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangible assets are largely attributable to our acquisition of ifrogz 
at least annually and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation  we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill 
this assessment initially permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity can support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would not need to perform the two step impairment test for the reporting unit 

table of contents however  if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the two step analysis is performed  which incorporated a fair value based approach 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on discounted cash flows and market approach analyses as considered necessary  and consider factors such as a weakened economy  reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with a decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization for a sustained period as indicators for potential goodwill impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or  more frequently upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
the company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing the indefinite lived intangible assets book value to its estimated fair value 
the fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets is determined by performing cash flow analysis and other market evaluations 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is less than book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
we test our investment in hzo each reporting period to determine whether hzo s operations or other factors indicate that the investment in hzo is impaired 
when indicators of impairment exist  we measure the fair value of our investments in hzo and compare the fair value to the carrying value 
the determination of the amount of impairment  if any  is based upon the difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including market and income approaches as considered necessary 
we assess other long lived assets  specifically definite lived intangibles and property  plant and equipment  for potential impairment based on similar impairment indicators 
when indicators of impairment exist related to our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets  we use an estimate of the undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether the carrying amount of the assets is recoverable 
measurement of the amount of impairment  if any  is based upon the difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including market and income approaches as considered necessary 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our goodwill and other long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
stock based compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements for awards granted to employees and non employees under its stock incentive plan  which include restricted stock and stock options 
equity classified awards are measured at the grant date fair value of the award 
the fair value of stock options is measured on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model bsm  which involves the use of assumptions such as expected volatility  expected term  dividend rate  and risk free rate 
volatility is a key factor used to determine the fair value of stock options in the bsm 
based on the expected term of the award  if the company does not have sufficient historical data or implied volatility information to determine volatility based upon its own information  the company uses significant judgment to identify a peer group and determine the appropriate weighting in order to estimate a volatility rate for use in the bsm 
on march   the company implemented a new incentive program for non executive employees that provides for the issuance of a fixed amount of restricted stock to eligible employees if certain annual financial targets are reached 
these targets were reached for the fiscal year  thus these restricted shares will be transferred to employees during march business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill 
we engaged independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased classes of intangible assets recorded by us include customer relationships  trademarks  non compete agreements  developed technology  patents  and backlog 
the fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets are discussed in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows related to each individual asset  market position of the trademarks  as well as assumptions about cash flow savings from the trademarks  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates

for the year ended december   approximately of our overall net sales were through our indirect channel  were through our website  and were through our mall cart and kiosk programs 
cost of sales cost of sales includes raw materials  finished goods purchased from manufacturers  packing materials  and shipping and fulfillment costs 
for the year ended december   cost of sales amounted to  or approximately of net sales compared to cost of sales of  or of net sales for the year ended december  our consistent cost of sales percentage is primarily the result of year over year changes in acquisition related charges  and in operational decisions made to meet customer needs and grow our business 
during  management incurred charges through cost of sales related to the write up of ifrogz inventory at acquisition 
these charges all occurred in  and thus increased cost of sales compared to this was offset by the following items that increased cost of sales during compared to an increase airfreight shipping costs incurred during primarily linked to product releases  the continued product sales mix shift  as a higher percentage of our total sales were generated by lower margin products such as our keyboard  audio  and case products compared to prior years where a higher percentage of sales were generated by our invisibleshield products  our highest margin products  and the continued channel sales mix shift as sales through indirect channels continued to grow  which are at lower margins than website sales directly to the consumer 

table of contents gross profit gross profit for the year ended december   was  or approximately of net sales as compared to  or approximately of net sales for the year ended december  our consistent gross profit percentage is primarily the result of year over year changes in acquisition related charges  and in operational decisions made to meet customer needs and grow our business

as we continue to grow our business  we anticipate that we will have increased sales through indirect channel partners and that our sales of keyboard  audio  case  and products in new categories will increase more quickly than our invisibleshield product sales 
thus  we expect these factors to put pressure on our gross profit percentage in future periods 
there are no assurances that we will continue to recognize similar gross profit margins in the future 
operating expenses total operating expenses for year ended december   were  an increase of  from total operating expenses for year ended december   of  the increases are primarily attributable to the following for the year ended december   marketing  advertising and promotion expenses were  an increase of  as compared to  for the year ended december  we invested heavily in advertising for key product launches including the invisibleshield hd  invisibleshield extreme  zaggkeys pro  the zaggkeys pro plus  the zaggkeys mini  zaggkeys mini  zaggkeys profolio  zaggkeys profolio  the zaggsparq family of mobile power options  the ifrogz boost boost plus  caliber gaming headsets  and the animatone line of audio accessories for young children 
we expect our marketing and advertising expenses to continue to be a significant expenditure as our revenues increase and expect to spend increased funds on advertising and promotion of our products as well as sales training 
during fiscal  we intend to continue to expand our marketing efforts related to our existing products and for our new product introductions 
during the fourth quarter of  we made a significant adjustment in brand strategy by placing greater focus on promoting our core brands  zagg and ifrogz  in an effort to improve brand clarity with consumers 
as a result of this adjustment in brand focus and lower stock price  the company conducted an impairment analysis that resulted in a non cash impairment charge of  related to the earpollution trademark and goodwill from the ifrogz acquisition 
no impairment charges were incurred during for the year ended december   amortization expense was  an increase of  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase is directly attributable to amortization expense on intangibles acquired as part of the acquisition of ifrogz in the second quarter of  which are being amortized on an accelerated basis 
as the acquisition occurred on june   only approximately six months of amortization was recorded in  while twelve months of amortization was recorded in for the year ended december   salaries and related taxes  including share based payment expense  increased by  to  from  for the year ended december  the increases in this category from to were related to the following increase in stock compensation expense from  in to  in  from executive stock compensation awards and a company wide grant of stock compensation awards  our consolidated company headcount increased from employees to though of the employees at the beginning of were part of the ifrogz acquisition and thus were only part of the company for approximately half of this increase and a full year with the ifrogz employees caused the overall increase in this expense category  in employment termination expenses incurred in the third quarter of related to the departure of former ceo  robert pedersen ii  a new company wide bonus program that commenced in march  and executive compensation salary adjustments 
for the year ended december   other selling  general and administrative expenses  net of salaries and related taxes described above  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the changes by category are summarized in the table below 
table of contents year ended december  year ended december  professional fees ifrogz transaction fees rent credit card and bank fees commissions depreciation other total the increase in professional fees is due to legal expenses incurred related to the defense of our patents  legal fees associated with the class action lawsuits  and increased accounting fees incurred in rents increased due primarily to expanding the number of suites occupied at the corporate offices in salt lake city  utah 
commissions and credit card and bank fees increased consistent with the overall increase in sales 
depreciation increased due to the addition of equipment and the completion of certain leasehold improvements at the corporate offices in salt lake city 
the increase in other relates to additional expenses incurred as a result of the overall increase in headcount and operations  including increases in health insurance costs  employee costs  bad debt expense  supplies  postage and delivery  utilities  investor relations and the fact that includes a full year of ifrogz expenses while only includes approximately six months

other income expense for the year ended december   total other expense was  compared to total other expense of  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to approximately a full year of interest expense under our previous debt agreement with pnc and cerberus that was incurred at the time of the ifrogz acquisition on june   while only had approximately six months of interest expense  a charge of paid to pnc and cerberus to terminate the credit agreement when the company refinanced with wells fargo  which is classified as a component of interest expense in the consolidated financials  a non cash charge of  related to the write off of debt issuance costs when the company terminated its credit agreement with pnc and cerberus and entered into a new credit agreement with wells fargo  which is classified as part of interest expense  and a loss from our equity method investment in hzo of  income taxes we recognized an income tax expense of  for the year ended december   compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended december  from to  our effective tax rate increased from to

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in addition  our international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions

we invest our cash in money market funds  which are subject to minimal credit and market risk 
we believe that the market risks associated with these financial instruments are immaterial  although there can be no guarantee that these market risks will be immaterial to us
