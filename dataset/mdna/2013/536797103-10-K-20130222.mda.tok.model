item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with item business  item a 
risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview as discussed in overview in item  business above  we are a leading operator of automotive franchises and retailer of new and used vehicles and services 
as of february   we offered brands of new vehicles and all brands of used vehicles in stores in the united states and online at lithia 
com 
we sell new and used cars and trucks and replacement parts  provide vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services  and arrange related financing  service contracts  protection products and credit insurance 
we continue to believe that the fragmented nature of the automotive dealership sector provides us with the opportunity to achieve growth through consolidation 
we seek exclusive franchises for acquisition and target mid sized and regional markets for domestic and import franchises and metropolitan markets for luxury franchises 
we have completed over acquisitions since our initial public offering in our acquisition strategy has been to acquire dealerships at prices that meet our internal investment targets and  through the application of our centralized operating structure  leverage costs and improve store profitability 
we believe the current economic environment provides us with attractive acquisition opportunities 
we also believe that we can continue to improve operations at our existing stores 
by promoting entrepreneurial leadership within our general managers and department managers  we strive for continual improvement to drive sales and capture market share in our local markets 
our goal is to retail an average of used vehicles per store per month and we believe we can make additional improvements in our used vehicle sales performance by offering lower priced value vehicles and selling brands other than the new vehicle franchise at each location 
our service  body and parts operations provide important repeat business for our stores 
we continue to grow this business through increased marketing efforts  competitive pricing on routine maintenance items and diverse commodity product offerings 
in  we continued to experience organic growth through increasing market share and maintaining a lean cost structure 
we believe our cost structure is aligned with current industry sales levels and positioned to be leveraged if vehicle sales levels continue to improve 
we target selling  general and administrative sg a expense as a percentage of gross profit in the high range as vehicle sales improve 
as we focus on maintaining discipline in controlling costs  we continue to target retaining  on a same store pre tax basis  of each incremental gross profit dollar after deducting sg a expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
certain accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on assumptions made by management 
while we have made our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to goodwill and franchise value  long lived assets  deferred tax assets  service contracts and other insurance contracts  and lifetime oil change and self insurance programs 
we also have other key accounting policies for valuation of accounts receivable  expense accruals and revenue recognition 
however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable 
however  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
goodwill and franchise value we are required to test our goodwill and franchise value for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we have determined that we operate as one reporting unit for evaluating goodwill 
we have the option to qualitatively or quantitatively assess goodwill for impairment and  in  evaluated our goodwill using a quantitative assessment process 
we test goodwill for impairment using the adjusted present value method apv to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit 
under the apv method  future cash flows are based on recently prepared budget forecasts and business plans and are used to estimate the future economic benefits that the reporting unit will generate 
an estimate of the appropriate discount rate is utilized to convert the future economic benefits to their present value equivalent 
the quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step identifies potential impairments by comparing the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not impaired and the second step is not necessary 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the second step includes determining the implied fair value through further market research 
the implied fair value of goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount to determine if an impairment loss should be recorded 
as of december   we had million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
the first step of our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we perform as of october of each year  did not result in an indication of impairment in  or the fair value of the reporting unit as of december   using the apv method  was greater than the carrying value at december  we have determined the appropriate unit of accounting for testing franchise rights for impairment is on an individual store basis 
we have the option to early adopt an amendment that allows us to qualitatively assess indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
in  we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible assets using a quantitative assessment process 
we estimate the fair value of our franchise rights primarily using the multi period excess earnings mpee model 
the forecasted cash flows used in the mpee model contain inherent uncertainties  including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates  margins  general operating expenses  and cost of capital 
we use primarily internally developed forecasts and business plans to estimate the future cash flows that each franchise will generate 
we have determined that only certain cash flows of the store are directly attributable to the franchise rights 
we estimate the appropriate interest rate to discount future cash flows to their present value equivalent taking into consideration factors such as a risk free rate  a peer group average beta  an equity risk premium and a small stock risk premium 
we also may use a market approach to determine the fair value of our franchise rights 
these market data points include our acquisition and divestiture experience and third party broker estimates 
as of december   we had million of franchise value on our balance sheet 
our impairment testing of franchise value did not indicate any impairment in  or we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that our goodwill or franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value 
a future decline in performance  decreases in projected growth rates or margin assumptions or changes in discount rates could result in a potential impairment  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
furthermore  in the event that a manufacturer is unable to remain solvent  we may be required to record a partial or total impairment on the remaining franchise value related to that manufacturer 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
long lived assets we estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  and review them for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
we determine a triggering event has occurred by reviewing store forecasted and historical financial performance 
a store is evaluated for recoverability if it has an operating loss in the current year and two of the prior three years 
additionally  we may judgmentally evaluate a store if its financial performance indicates it may not support the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
if a store meets these criteria  we estimate the projected undiscounted cash flows for each asset group based on internally developed forecasts 
if the undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the asset group  we determine the fair value of the asset group based on additional market data  including recent experience in selling similar assets 
we hold certain property for future development or investment purposes 
if a triggering event is deemed to have occurred  we evaluate the property for impairment by comparing its estimated fair value based on listing price less costs to sell and other market data  including similar property that is for sale or has been recently sold  to the current carrying value 
if the carrying value is more than the estimated fair value  an impairment is recorded 
although we believe our property and equipment and assets held and used are appropriately valued  the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
a future decline in store performance  decrease in projected growth rates or changes in other operating assumptions could result in an impairment of long lived asset groups  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
due to the adverse change in the business climate and the commercial real estate market  we performed impairment testing on long lived assets  mainly related to certain property held for future development or investment purposes in  and as a result  we recorded impairments related to long lived assets of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
deferred tax assets as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and deferred tax liabilities of million 
the principal components of our deferred tax assets are related to goodwill  allowances and accruals  capital loss carryforwards  deferred revenue and cancellation reserves 
the principal components of our deferred tax liabilities are related to depreciation on property and equipment and inventories 
we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  and our projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of the unreserved deductible differences 
as of december   we had an million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance was associated with losses from the sale of corporate entities 
as these amounts are characterized as capital losses  we evaluated the availability of projected capital gains and determined that it would be unlikely these amounts would be fully utilized 
if we are unable to meet the projected taxable income levels utilized in our analysis  and depending on the availability of feasible tax planning strategies  we might record an additional valuation allowance on a portion or all of our deferred tax assets in the future 
in the event that a manufacturer is unable to remain solvent  our operations may be impacted and we might record a valuation allowance on a portion or all of the deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
service contracts and other insurance contracts we receive commissions from the sale of vehicle service contracts and certain other insurance contracts 
the contracts are sold through unrelated third parties  but we may be charged back for a portion of the commissions in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
we sell these contracts on a straight commission basis  in addition  we may also participate in future underwriting profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which are recognized as income upon receipt 
we record commissions at the time of sale of the vehicles  net of an estimated liability for future charge backs 
we have established a reserve for estimated future charge backs based on an analysis of historical charge backs in conjunction with estimated lives of the applicable contracts 
if future cancellations are different than expected  we could have additional expense related to the cancellations in future periods  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december  and  the reserve for future cancellations totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
a increase in expected cancellations would result in an additional reserve of approximately million 
lifetime oil change self insurance in march  we assumed from a third party the obligation to provide future lifetime oil service for a pool of existing contracts and began to self insure the majority of the lifetime oil contracts we sell 
payments we receive upon sale of the lifetime oil contracts are deferred and recognized in revenue over the expected life of the service agreement to best match the expected timing of the costs to be incurred to perform the service 
we estimate the timing and amount of future costs for claims and cancellations related to our lifetime oil contracts using historical experience rates and estimated future costs 
if our estimates of future costs to perform under the contracts exceed the existing deferred revenue  we record a charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
we perform our loss contingency analysis separately for the pool of assumed contracts and the pool of self insured contracts sold starting in march we recorded a charge of million in both and for expected costs in excess of revenue deferred related to the pool of assumed contracts 
we did not record an additional charge in the analysis on our self insured sold contracts did not indicate a loss reserve was needed in  and we believe the new vehicle purchase cycle has been delayed for many buyers 
if the ownership cycle does not accelerate towards pre recession levels  our estimate of the number of oil changes to be performed over a vehicle s life may increase  which would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  other changes in assumptions about future costs expected to be incurred to service contracts could result in the recognition of additional charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
a change in expected claims costs per contract for the assumed pool of contracts would result in an additional reserve of approximately million 
a change in expected claims per contract for the self insured sold contracts would not require any additional reserve 
at december   the remaining deferred revenue related to the assumed obligation and the self insured sold contracts was million and million  respectively 
self insurance programs we self insure a portion of our property and casualty insurance  medical insurance and workers compensation insurance 
third parties are engaged to estimate the loss exposure related to the self retained portion of the risk associated with these insurances 
additionally  we analyze our historical loss and claims experience to estimate the loss exposure associated with these programs 
any changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in the recognition of additional charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december  and  the total reserve associated with these programs was million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
a increase in claims experience would result in an additional reserve of approximately million 
results of continuing operations for the year ended december   we reported income from continuing operations  net of tax  of million  or per diluted share 
for the years ended december  and  we reported income from continuing operations  net of tax  of million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
discontinued operations results for sold or closed stores  qualifying for reclassification under the applicable accounting guidance  have their results presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  our results from continuing operations are presented on a comparable basis for all periods 
within discontinued operations  we realized a gain  net of tax  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

key performance metrics certain key performance metrics for revenue and gross profit were as follows for  and dollars in thousands revenues percent of total revenues gross profit gross profit margin percent of total gross profit new vehicle used vehicle  retail used vehicle  wholesale finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other revenues percent of total revenues gross profit gross profit margin percent of total gross profit new vehicle used vehicle  retail used vehicle  wholesale finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other revenues percent of total revenues gross profit gross profit margin percent of total gross profit new vehicle used vehicle  retail used vehicle  wholesale finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other commissions reported net of anticipated cancellations 
same store operating data we believe that same store sales are a key indicator of our financial performance 
same store metrics demonstrate our ability to grow our revenue and profitability in our existing locations 
as a result  same store sales have been integrated into the discussion below 
a same store metric represents stores that were operating during  and only includes the months when operations occur in both comparable periods 
for example  a store acquired in august would be included in same store operating data beginning in september  after its first full complete comparable month of operation 
thus  operating results for same store comparisons would include only the period of september through december of both comparable years 
new vehicle revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase reported revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit same store revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit year ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase reported revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit same store revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit new vehicle sales in improved compared to primarily due to volume growth as year over year same store sales volume increased and  respectively  in and the number of new vehicles sold in the us in  defined as the seasonally adjusted annual rate  grew approximately over in addition to the overall market recovery  we have increased our share of vehicle sales in several of our markets 
growth in our domestic and import brand sales have outpaced the growth experienced nationally 
our domestic brand same store sales grew in compared to same store sales for import brands grew in compared to certain of our markets have seen an increase in local market sales volumes exceeding the national average 
we remain focused on increasing our share of overall new vehicle sales within our markets 
new vehicle sales improved throughout compared to due to a recovery in the us economy and our efforts to increase our share of the new vehicles sold within each local market 
credit availability continued to improve throughout  although  within the sub prime market  lending remained constrained 
used vehicle retail revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase reported retail revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit same store retail revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit year ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase reported retail revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit same store retail revenue retail units sold average selling price per retail unit used vehicle retail sales continue to be a strategic focus as we strive for organic growth 
our strategy is to offer three categories of used vehicles manufacturer certified pre owned used vehicles  late model  lower mileage vehicles  and value autos  vehicles with over  miles 
in  sales increased in all three categories of used vehicles compared to same store unit sales for manufacturer certified pre owned used vehicles increased 
this category has higher average sale prices and experiences a lower gross margin than the other categories 
same store unit sales for the late model  lower mileage vehicle category increased 
our performance in this category is still below management s expectation and we continue to focus on improving our results 
same store unit sales for the value auto category increased 
value auto vehicles have lower average selling prices and experience a higher gross margin than our other used vehicle categories 
additionally  value autos provide an organic opportunity to convert vehicles acquired via trade in to retail used vehicle sales 
our retail used to new vehicle sales ratio was for the year ended december  compared to in and in on average  each of our stores currently sells retail used vehicle units per month and we target increasing sales to units per month 
used vehicle retail unit sales increased in compared to as consumers elected to purchase used vehicles instead of new vehicles  and as we increased the number of lower price  higher margin  older used vehicles we sell 
we also increased the sale of brands other than the store s new vehicle franchise 
we focused our store personnel on maximizing retail used vehicle sales and reducing the number of used vehicles we wholesale after acquiring them via trade in 
used vehicle wholesale revenues year ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease reported wholesale revenue wholesale units sold average selling price per wholesale unit same store wholesale revenue wholesale units sold average selling price per wholesale unit year ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase reported wholesale revenue wholesale units sold average selling price per wholesale unit same store wholesale revenue wholesale units sold average selling price per wholesale unit wholesale transactions are vehicles we have purchased from customers or vehicles we have attempted to sell via retail that we elect to dispose of due to inventory age or other factors 
wholesale vehicles are typically sold at or near inventory cost and do not comprise a meaningful component of our gross profit 
we generated wholesale gross profit of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
finance and insurance year ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase reported revenue same store revenue year ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease reported revenue same store revenue the increases in finance and insurance sales in compared to and compared to were driven by increased vehicle sales volume 
the availability of consumer credit has expanded since with lenders increasing the loan to value amount available to most customers 
additionally  competition continued to increase among lenders and we saw an increase in finance reserves 
as a result  we experienced annual improvement in the average amount of revenue per unit 
these shifts afforded us the opportunity to sell additional or more comprehensive products  while remaining within a loan to value framework acceptable to our retail customer lenders 
penetration rates for certain products were as follows finance and insurance service contracts lifetime oil change and filter service  body and parts revenue year ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease reported customer pay warranty wholesale parts body shop total service  body and parts same store customer pay warranty wholesale parts body shop total service  body and parts year ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease reported customer pay warranty wholesale parts body shop total service  body and parts same store customer pay warranty wholesale parts body shop total service  body and parts our service  body and parts business improved in compared to and in compared to our customer pay business has increased as we maintained our focus on retaining customers through competitively priced routine maintenance offerings and increased marketing efforts 
the same store customer pay service and parts business represented and of the total same store service  body and parts business in and  respectively 
as a result of our increased focus and marketing efforts  same store customer pay business increased in compared to and in compared to warranty work accounted for approximately of our same store service  body and parts sales in compared to in in compared to  same store warranty sales decreased 
domestic brand warranty work decreased by  while import luxury warranty work decreased by in compared to same store warranty work declined in compared to warranty work continues to be impacted by declining units in operation from  and and increased vehicle reliability  particularly in domestic brands 
we continued to grow our wholesale parts and body shop sales in  which represented of our same store service  body and parts revenue mix in and grew on a same store basis in compared to these categories allow for incremental organic growth 
because both wholesale parts and body shop margins are lower than service work  we expect gross margins may modestly decline as these areas of the business comprise a larger portion of the total 
gross profit gross profit increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the increases in and were primarily due to increased revenues  partially offset by declines in our overall gross profit margin 
our gross profit margins by business line were as follows basis year ended december  point change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicle finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other overall basis year ended december  point change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicle finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other overall a basis point is equal to th of one percent 
our overall gross profit margin decreased basis points in compared to new vehicle margins decreased compared to this decrease was due to higher gross margins in as new vehicle supply had been limited due to the earthquake and tsunami in japan 
additionally  in  to gain market share in certain markets  we priced vehicles lower  negatively impacting margins 
used vehicle margins and service  body and parts margins were relatively unchanged in compared to our overall gross profit margin decreased primarily due to a mix shift as we sold a greater number of new vehicles  which have lower margins than our other businesses 
asset impairment charges asset impairments recorded as a component of continuing operations consist of the following in thousands year ended december  asset impairments long lived assets during and  we recorded impairment charges associated with certain properties 
as the expected future use of these facilities changed  the long lived assets were tested for recoverability 
as a result  we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value of these properties and asset impairment charges were recorded 
during  we believed events and circumstances indicated the carrying amount of our non operational long lived assets may no longer be recoverable  triggering interim impairment tests 
we determined a triggering event had occurred based on the following factors slower industry recovery for retail vehicle sales than originally projected at the end of  oversupply of vacant dealership properties due to the economic downturn and bankruptcy proceedings for chrysler and gm  and the broader economic recovery  including the availability of credit  remained gradual  limiting the potential buyers of these types of properties 
based on the results of those tests  we recorded asset impairment charges associated with certain properties during see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

these increases in costs were offset by a continued focus to reduce or maintain fixed costs and effectively manage variable costs 
in  a million gain on the sale of property in california was recorded as a component of facility costs 
sg a as a percentage of gross profit was in compared to in and in adjusting for the gain on the sale of property in california and other pro forma items  our adjusted sg a expense as a percentage of gross profit was in compared to in and in see non gaap reconciliations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding pro forma sg a expense 
as sales volume increases and we gain leverage in our cost structure  we anticipate achieving metrics of sg a as a percentage of gross profit in the high range with improved sales volumes 
we also measure the leverage of our cost structure by evaluating throughput  which is the incremental percentage of gross profit retained after deducting sg a expense 
year ended december  of change in dollars in thousands change gross profit gross profit sg a expense throughput contribution year ended december  of change in dollars in thousands change gross profit gross profit sg a expense throughput contribution throughput contributions for newly opened or acquired stores are on a first dollar basis for the first twelve months of operations 
we acquired four stores and opened two new stores in and  adjusting for these locations  our throughput contribution on a same store basis was for the year ended december  compared to our throughput contribution on a same store basis for compared to was 
we continue to target a same store throughput contribution of approximately 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization is comprised of depreciation expense related to buildings  significant remodels or betterments  furniture  tools  equipment and signage and amortization of certain intangible assets  including customer lists and non compete agreements 
year ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase depreciation and amortization year ended december  dollars in thousands decrease decrease depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million in compared to due to increased capital expenditures of million in these expenditures were for the improvement of store facilities  purchases of new store locations  replacement of equipment and construction of a new headquarters building 
depreciation and amortization decreased million in compared to the decrease in compared to was due primarily to the sale of facilities in the second half of and early operating income operating income was  and of revenue  respectively  in  and the increases in compared to  and compared to were primarily due to improved sales and continued cost control 
floor plan interest expense and floor plan assistance floor plan interest expense increased million in compared to this increase is due to higher inventory levels compared to the prior year 
floor plan interest expense increased million in compared to floor plan assistance is provided by manufacturers to support store financing of new vehicle inventory 
under accounting standards  floor plan assistance is recorded as a component of new vehicle gross profit when the specific vehicle is sold 
however  because manufacturers provide this assistance to offset inventory carrying costs  we believe a comparison of floor plan interest expense to floor plan assistance is a useful measure of the efficiency of our new vehicle sales relative to stocking levels 
the following tables detail the carrying costs for new vehicles and include new vehicle floor plan interest net of floor plan assistance earned 
year ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase floor plan interest expense new vehicles floor plan assistance included as an offset to cost of sales net new vehicle carrying costs benefit year ended december  dollars in thousands increase increase floor plan interest expense new vehicles floor plan assistance included as an offset to cost of sales net new vehicle carrying costs benefit other interest expense other interest expense includes interest on debt incurred related to acquisitions  real estate mortgages and our working capital  acquisition and used vehicle credit facility 
year ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease mortgage interest other interest capitalized interest total other interest expense year ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease mortgage interest other interest capitalized interest total other interest expense for compared to  other interest decreased million primarily due to the retirement of approximately million in mortgages mainly in the first half of we also refinanced mortgages resulting in reduced interest rates 
we had million in mortgage issuances  mainly occurring in the fourth quarter of  which had minimal impact on interest expense for the full year 
this decrease related to mortgage interest was offset by higher volumes of borrowing on our credit facility 
other interest expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to decreases in outstanding real estate mortgage debt  partially offset by an increase in interest on our working capital  acquisition and used vehicle credit facility due to a higher volume of borrowing compared to additionally  we recorded million in capitalized interest in associated with construction projects  further reducing our overall interest expense 
other income  net other income  net primarily includes interest income and  beginning in  the gains related to an equity investment 
other income  net was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was in  in and in our federal income tax rate is and our state income tax rate is currently  which varies with the mix of states where our stores are located 
we also have certain non deductible expenses and other adjustments that impact our effective rate 
non gaap reconciliations we believe each of the non gaap financial measures below improves the transparency of our disclosures  provides a meaningful presentation of our results from the core business operations excluding adjustments for items not related to our ongoing core business operations or other non cash adjustments  and improves the period to period comparability of our results from the core business operations 
our management uses these measures in conjunction with gaap financial measures as part of our assessment of our business  including our compliance with covenants in our credit facility and in communications with our board of directors concerning financial performance 
these measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap measures 
the following tables reconcile certain non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measure from our consolidated statements of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  as reported asset impairment and disposal gain equity investment tax attribute adjusted asset impairments selling  general and administrative income from operations other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision income from continuing operations  net of income tax income from discontinued operations  net of income tax net income diluted income loss per share from continuing operations diluted income loss per share from discontinued operations diluted net income per share diluted share count year ended december  as reported asset impairment and disposal gain reserve adjustments adjusted cost of sales service  body and parts gross profit asset impairments selling  general and administrative income from operations income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision income from continuing operations  net of income tax income from discontinued operations  net of income tax net income diluted income per share from continuing operations diluted income per share from discontinued operations diluted net income per share diluted share count year ended december  as reported asset impairment and disposal gain reserve adjustment adjusted gross profit asset impairments selling  general and administrative income from operations income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision income from continuing operations  net of income tax income from discontinued operations  net of income tax income from continuing operations  net of income tax diluted income loss per share from continuing operations diluted income loss per share from discontinued operations diluted net income per share diluted share count liquidity and capital resources we manage our liquidity and capital resources to be able to fund future capital expenditures  working capital requirements and contractual obligations 
additionally  we use capital resources to fund cash dividend payments  share repurchases and acquisitions 
available sources we have relied primarily on cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements  financing of real estate and the proceeds from equity and debt offerings to finance operations and expansion 
based on these factors and our normal operational cash flow  we believe we have sufficient availability to accommodate both our short and long term capital needs 
below is a summary and discussion of our available funds in thousands as of december  increase increase decrease decrease cash and cash equivalents available credit on the credit facility unfinanced new vehicles total available funds historically  we have raised capital through the sale of assets  sale of stores  issuance of stock and the issuance of debt 
we may strategically use excess cash to reduce the amount of debt outstanding when appropriate 
during  and  we raised million  million and million  respectively  through the sale of assets and stores and the issuance of long term debt primarily related to the financing of certain real estate  net of debt repayments in excess of scheduled amounts 
we have the ability to raise funds through the financing of owned real estate 
as of december   we had a book value of million in unfinanced owned real estate 
assuming we can obtain financing on of this value  we estimate we could obtain additional funds of approximately million  however  no assurances can be provided that this capital source will be available in sufficient amounts or with terms acceptable to us 
while we have no immediate plans to access such funds  we have an effective shelf registration statement with the sec that allows us to offer for sale  from time to time and as the capital markets permit  up to million in various forms of debt or equity securities 
in addition to the above sources of liquidity  potential sources include the placement of subordinated debentures or loans  additional store sales or additional other asset sales 
we will evaluate all of these options and may select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the availability and cost of capital  although no assurances can be provided that these capital sources will be available in sufficient amounts or with terms acceptable to us 
summary of outstanding balances on credit facilities and long term debt below is a summary of our outstanding balances on credit facilities and long term debt in thousands outstanding as of december  remaining available as of december  new vehicle floor plan commitment floor plan notes payable used vehicle inventory financing facility revolving line of credit real estate mortgages other debt liabilities related to assets held for sale total debt we have a million new vehicle floor plan commitment as part of our credit facility 
available credit is based on the borrowing base amount effective as of december  this amount is reduced by million for outstanding letters of credit 
the amount available on the credit facility is limited based on a borrowing base calculation and fluctuates monthly 
at december   an additional million of floor plan notes payable outstanding on our new vehicle floor plan commitment and million of floor plan notes payable on vehicles designated as service loaners are recorded as liabilities related to assets held for sale 
credit facility on april   we executed a new five year million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions  including four manufacturer affiliated finance companies 
on december  we entered into an amendment to the loan agreement that expanded the available loan commitment to million 
the amendment to loan agreement amended the allocation of the financing commitment to million in new vehicle inventory floor plan financing  million in used vehicle inventory floor plan financing and million in a revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and working capital 
all borrowings from  and repayments to  our syndicated lending group are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as financing activities 
the interest rate on the credit facility varies based on the type of debt with the rate ranging from the one month libor plus to the one month libor plus 
the interest rates on the credit facility at december  ranged from to 
our financial covenants related to this credit facility include maintaining a current ratio of not less than x  a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than x and a leverage ratio of not more than x 
new vehicle lines we finance substantially all of our new vehicles through the new vehicle floor plan commitment component of our credit facility 
we also have additional floor plan agreements with manufacturer affiliated finance companies for vehicles that are designated for use as service loaners 
borrowings from  and repayments to  manufacturer affiliated finance companies are classified as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
real estate mortgages and other debt we have mortgages associated with our owned real estate and leasehold improvements 
interest rates related to this debt ranged from to at december  the mortgages are payable in various installments through may as of december   we had fixed interest rates on of our outstanding mortgages 
our other debt includes various notes  capital leases and obligations assumed as a result of acquisitions and other agreements and had interest rates that ranged from to at december  this debt  which totaled million at december   is due in various installments through may debt covenants under the terms of our credit facility and other debt agreements  we are subject to financial covenants and restrictive covenants that limit or restrict our incurring additional indebtedness  making investments  selling or acquiring assets and granting security interests in our assets 
under our credit facility  we are required to maintain the ratios detailed in the following table debt covenant ratio requirement as of december  current ratio not less than to to fixed charge coverage ratio not less than to to liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not more than to to funded debt restriction not to exceed million million we expect to remain in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants in our credit facility and other debt agreements 
however  no assurances can be provided that we will continue to remain in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants 
if we do not meet the financial and restrictive covenants and are unable to remediate or cure the condition or obtain a waiver from our lenders  a breach would give rise to remedies under the agreement  the most severe of which is the termination of the agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed 
we also would trigger cross defaults under other debt agreements 
inventories we calculate days supply of inventory based on current inventory levels  excluding in transit vehicles  and a day historical cost of sales level 
as of december   our new vehicle days supply was  or days higher than our days supply as of december  the increase in our new vehicle inventory levels is partly related to the building of certain truck models prior to manufacturer planned platform changes  when production is halted and additional vehicles will not be available for several months 
additionally  new vehicle inventory levels were lower than normal as inventory supply was recovering from the effects of the earthquake and tsunami in japan in the last half of our days supply of used vehicles was days as of december   or days higher than our days supply as of december  we have continued to focus on managing our mix and maintaining an appropriate level of used vehicle inventory 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december   was as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond new vehicle floor plan commitment floor plan notes payable used vehicle inventory financing facility revolving line of credit liabilities related to assets held for sale real estate debt  including interest other debt  including capital leases and interest charge backs on various contracts operating leases fixed rate payments on interest rate swaps amounts for floor plan notes payable  the used vehicle inventory financing facility and the revolving line of credit do not include estimated interest payments 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amounts for operating lease commitments do not include sublease income  and certain operating expenses such as maintenance  insurance and real estate taxes 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in compared to was mainly related to the building of facilities for an awarded open point  the purchase of previously leased facilities  image improvements and the construction of  and relocation to  a new headquarters building 
the increase in compared to was related to improvements at certain of our store facilities  the purchase of new store locations  replacement of equipment and construction of a new headquarters building 
many manufacturers provide assistance in the form of additional vehicle incentives if facilities meet image standards and requirements 
we believe it is an attractive time to invest in certain facility upgrades and remodels that will generate additional manufacturer incentive payments 
also  recently enacted tax law changes that accelerate deductions for capital expenditures have accelerated project timelines to ensure completion before the law expires 
in the event we undertake a significant capital commitment in the future  we expect to pay for the commitment out of existing cash balances  construction financing and borrowings on our credit facility 
upon completion of the projects  we would anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended  although no assurances can be provided that these financings will be available to us in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
dividends our board of directors paid dividends on our class a and class b common stock in as follows dividend paid dividend amount per share total amount of dividend in thousands march may august november december management evaluates performance and makes a recommendation to the board of directors on dividend payments on a quarterly basis 
an additional dividend payment was paid in december in lieu of the dividend typically declared and paid in march of the following year 
share repurchase program in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
as of december   we had purchased all available shares under this program   of which were purchased during at an average price of per share 
in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of  additional shares of our class a common stock 
through december   we had purchased  shares under these programs at an average price of per share 
as of december    shares remained available for repurchase 
these plans do not have an expiration date and we may continue to repurchase shares from time to time as conditions warrant 
selected consolidated quarterly financial data the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly financial data

certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the quarterly financial data to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather in certain of our markets and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance is expected to be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt  consumer confidence and manufacturer sales incentives  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
inflation the effects of inflation were insignificant in the years ended december   and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt our credit facility  other floor plan notes payable and certain real estate mortgages are structured as variable rate debt 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are tied to either the one or three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations  therefore  expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
certain floor plan debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
our variable rate floor plan notes payable  variable rate mortgage notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million  net of tax  based on amounts outstanding at december  fixed rate debt the fair value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall because we would expect to be able to refinance for a lower rate 
conversely  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
at december   we had million of long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet  with maturity dates between november and may based on discounted cash flows using current interest rates for comparable debt  we have determined that the fair value of this long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
we have effectively changed the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of our floor plan debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate floor plan debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not engage in interest rate speculation using derivative instruments 
typically  we designate all interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
as of december   we had outstanding the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month  matures january  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  matures april million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  matures april  and million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  matures june we receive interest on all of the interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum  as reported in the wall street journal 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
these amounts related to our cash flow hedges are recorded as deferred gains or losses in our consolidated balance sheets with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
changes to the fair value of discontinued cash flow hedges are recognized into earnings as a component of floor plan interest expense 
at december   the fair value of all of our agreements was a liability of million 
the estimated amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months was million at december  risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
our policy is to manage this risk through a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt structures and interest rate swaps 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and forecasted debt obligations  as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows
