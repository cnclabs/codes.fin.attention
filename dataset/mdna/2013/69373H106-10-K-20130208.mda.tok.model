overview we are a leading asset light north american third party logistics provider offering a broad array of services to facilitate the movement of freight from origin to destination 
we operate in two segments  the intermodal segment and the logistics segment 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for segment information 
our intermodal segment provides intermodal rail transportation  local cartage and intermodal marketing services 
our logistics segment provides highway brokerage  warehousing and distribution  international freight forwarding  ocean and air shipping  and supply chain management services 
executive summary our results in both our intermodal and logistics segments reflect many of the challenges that we continue to face in the current economic climate 
our intermodal segment performance during the year reflects continued cost pressure from the railroads coupled with a market that was unsupportive of price increases for most of the year 
our intermodal segment performance improved by the end of year partially due to our focus on improving under performing traffic corridors and reducing controllable costs 
our logistics segment results reflect soft global economic conditions  depressed levels of trans pacific trade and competitive pressures  as well as customer attrition and management turnover in our european ocean operation that occurred during during  we undertook a number of strategic initiatives which we believe will positively impact our underlying cost structure and improve our margins in both the intermodal and logistics segments 
in the fourth quarter we entered into a multi year agreement with union pacific that continues our handling of shipments in the us mexico automotive parts business and allows us to develop and grow our retail direct us mexico business  appointed a new chief operating officer who brings deep industry knowledge and extensive experience to our executive management team and will oversee the operations of both our intermodal and logistics segments  and realigned our intermodal operations to enhance our customer service and streamline our operations 
on the logistics side  we appointed a talented new management team for our international logistics business that brings a wealth of knowledge and experience and plan to continue to build the operational and sales leadership of this business 
in the fourth quarter of  we obtained new business licenses that will allow us to sell our services direct to customers in china and expand our international logistics network 
we also completed our evaluation of operating systems to support the international freight forwarding business and have selected a solution we are currently implementing 
we expect these investments in personnel and systems will allow the logistics segment to return to profitability in the second half of and will build a stronger foundation for selling our integrated portfolio of services to customers 

table of contents we also took advantage of favorable market conditions and interest rates to enter into new railcar leases in the first and second quarter of to reduce our lease costs which will partially offset the rising costs of railcar maintenance 
finally  in the third quarter of  we amended our revolving credit facility to  among other things  extend its maturity and reduce applicable interest rate margins and fees  thereby reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these initiatives allowed us to end on a high note and helped put us in a stronger position heading into with the implementation of the new multi year agreement with union pacific on january   we expect a significant reduction in the gross revenue throughout that we historically earned from the us mexico wholesale intermodal automotive business and a corresponding reduction in the cost of purchased transportation and services 
however  we expect that our margin contribution from this business in will remain consistent with its historical contribution level 
this expected margin contribution in is primarily dependent on the volume of us mexico automotive parts shipments via the network that we manage under the new agreement  the volume of pacer equipment used via the network that we manage versus rail or other equipment  and the amount of selling  general and administrative costs incurred to run this business 
over the remaining term of the agreement  our revenue and margin for the services and equipment provided under the agreement decline absent forecasted growth in our retail direct us mexico business and will also continue to be dependent on the previously mentioned factors 
we continue to prudently manage selling  general and administrative expenses which decreased million in compared to direct operating expenses  which include the expenses associated with our container  chassis and railcar fleet  also declined million in as compared to managing and leveraging our fixed costs remains a focus area for the company in the upcoming year 
we were debt free at december   and ended the year with million of borrowing capacity 
we believe that our cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
use of non gaap financial measures from time to time in press releases regarding quarterly earnings  presentations and other communications  we may provide financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these measures include adjusted revenues  adjusted intermodal revenues  adjusted intermodal gross margin and adjusted intermodal operating income for  each of which excludes from results the impact of the previously announced volume reduction of the ocean carrier customer that transitioned its western business directly to the railroad  adjusted intermodal operating income for also excludes the impact of the gain on sale of railcar assets which occurred in the third quarter of  adjusted income tax expense and adjusted earnings per share  each of which excludes from results the deferred tax asset adjustment in  and adjusted revenues for which excludes the impact of the transition during of the east west big box business from intermodal marketing companies imcs 
management uses these non gaap measures in its analysis of the company s performance and regularly reports such information to our board of directors 
management believes that presentations of financial measures excluding the impact of these items provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of our core businesses and allows investors  management and our board to more easily compare operating results from period to period 
however  the use of any such non gaap financial information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues  net income or loss  operating income or loss  cash flows from operations or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
these non gaap measures may not be comparable to those used by other companies 
background the following section describes some of our revenue and expense categories and is provided to facilitate investors understanding of the discussion of our historical financial results  including these revenue and expense items  discussed under the caption results of operations 

table of contents revenues intermodal segment revenues are generated from the movement of freight in containers and trailers utilizing truck and rail transportation 
revenues are generated by the rates  fuel surcharges and other fees we charge customers for the transportation of freight  and are impacted by changes in volume  product mix  length of haul  and route changes 
also included in intermodal segment revenues are railcar rental income  container and chassis per diem charges and incentives paid by apl limited and others for the repositioning of empty containers with domestic westbound backhaul loads 
logistics segment revenues are generated through rates and other fees charged for our portfolio of freight transportation services  including highway brokerage  warehousing and distribution  international nvocc  freight forwarding  and supply chain management services 
through our international ocean and air shipping and freight forwarding services  we arrange transportation and other services necessary to move our customers freight to and from a foreign country 
revenues for international ocean and air shipping and freight forwarding are driven by changes in international trade volumes  rate changes  product mix and route changes 
revenues from highway brokerage are driven primarily by volumes  rates and the level of outsourcing by companies of their transportation and logistics needs 
revenues for warehousing and distribution  which include the handling  consolidation deconsolidation and storage of freight on behalf of the shipper  are driven by outsourcing and import volumes and by steamship lines use of third party containers  rather than their own containers  on the west coast to move freight inland 
through our supply chain management services  we manage all aspects of the supply chain from inbound sourcing and delivery logistics through outbound shipment  handling  consolidation  deconsolidation  distribution  and just in time delivery of end products to our customers 
revenues for supply chain management services are recognized on a net basis and are driven by changes in transactional volumes and rates for services charged on a per transaction basis and by increases in services and costs for services rendered on a cost plus basis 
cost of purchased transportation and services the intermodal segment s cost of purchased transportation and related services consists primarily of the amounts charged to us by railroads  local trucking companies and owner operators under our agreements with these transportation providers 
third party rail costs are charged through agreements with the railroads and are dependent upon the competitive environment  capacity constraints  fuel surcharges  product mix  and traffic lanes 
in addition  terminal and cargo handling services represent the variable expenses directly associated with handling freight at a terminal location 
the cost of these services is variable in nature and is based on the volume of freight shipped and rates charged 
the logistics segment cost of purchased transportation and related services consists of amounts paid to third parties under our agreements with them to provide such services  such as independent contractor truck drivers  ocean carriers  and freight terminal operators and dock workers  labor and facilities costs directly related to our warehousing and distribution services  and labor and third party professional fees related to our consulting and supply chain management services 
sub contracted or independent operators are paid on a percentage of revenues  mileage or a fixed fee from point to point or between zones 
direct operating expenses direct operating expenses are both fixed and variable expenses directly relating to our intermodal operations and consist of equipment lease expense  equipment depreciation expense  equipment maintenance and repair costs  fixed terminal and cargo handling expenses and operating costs of our local drayage facilities 
our fleet of leased equipment is accessed through a variety of short and long term leases 
changes to the size of our equipment fleet will primarily be through adjustment to leased equipment as the volume of our business dictates 
equipment maintenance and repair costs consist of the costs related to the upkeep of the equipment fleet  which can be considered semi variable in nature  as a certain amount relates to the annual preventative maintenance costs in addition to amounts driven by fleet usage 
fixed terminal and cargo handling costs primarily relate to the fixed rent and storage expense charged to us by terminal operators and is expected to remain relatively fixed 
operating costs of our local drayage facilities consist mainly of labor  rent  maintenance  utilities and other facility related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses the selling  general and administrative expenses of both the intermodal and logistics segments consist of costs relating to customer acquisition  billing  customer service  salaries and related expenses of the executive and administrative staff  office expenses  technology services  professional fees relating to the aforementioned functions  depreciation expense excluding railcar  container and chassis depreciation and  prior to june   the million annual fee historically paid to apl limited for information technology services  which were terminated on that date 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses relate to the costs of executive  administrative  internal audit  marketing  finance  legal  and human resources functions

our big box equipment turns remained consistent at turns in both the and periods 
international and drayage revenues  excluding the ocean carrier customer reduction discussed above  decreased a combined due primarily to a decline in volumes attributed to competitive pressures and the continued softening of the global shipping market 
revenues in our logistics segment decreased million  or  in compared to the decline is primarily due to a decrease in volumes of our shipping operations attributed to competitive pricing pressures  customer attrition and continued softness in the global market 
cost of purchased transportation and services and direct operating expenses 
cost of purchased transportation and services and direct operating expenses decreased million  or  in compared to primarily attributable to the logistics segment 
direct operating expenses are only incurred in the intermodal segment 
the intermodal segment s cost of purchased transportation and services and direct operating expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily driven by increased rail provider and trucking costs and changes in customer mix 
these increases were offset by a decrease in lease termination costs from million in to million in  as well as a million decrease in amortization of the deferred gain related to the arrangements with union pacific see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
this deferred gain was fully amortized in the fourth quarter of cost of purchased transportation and services in our logistics segment decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was due primarily to decreased volumes resulting from the softening of the international shipping market  customer attrition  and management turnover in our european ocean operation

income loss from operations 
income from operations decreased million from million in to million in intermodal segment income from operations decreased million to million in compared to income from operations of million in the decrease was primarily due to increased rail provider costs over and above what we were able to pass onto our customers which also resulted in lower customer volumes 
also contributing to the decrease were million of amortized gains in related to the up payment that is not included in the results as the gains were fully amortized in excluding the impact of the reduction in volume from the transitioned ocean carrier customer and the gain on sale of railcar assets of million from the results  the income from operations increased million  or  compared to adjusted intermodal operating income 
the logistics segment incurred a loss from operations of million in compared to a loss from operations of million in the increased loss was primarily due to volume declines in ocean shipments attributed to competitive pricing pressures  customer attrition  continued softness in the global market  and management turnover in our european ocean operation 
corporate loss from operations decreased million from million in to million in the corporate selling  general  and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent year over year

assuming that the new agreement had been in place during  the amount of available borrowings under the credit agreement at december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
notwithstanding the expected lower borrowing base beginning in  we believe that our cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the credit agreement will remain sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
credit facility our revolving credit agreement dated december   as amended on july  the credit agreement  matures on july  and provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million including a million letter of credit facility and a million swing line loan facility  and an accordion feature providing for an increase in the facility of up to million subject to certain conditions for a total facility of million if such conditions are met 
the amount available for borrowing under the facility is determined by reference to a borrowing base formula which is equal to the lesser of the aggregate commitments of the lenders currently million  or an amount equal to the sum of a of the eligible accounts receivable  b of eligible earned but unbilled accounts receivables up to million  and c an amount equal to the lesser of i of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible owned railcars and chassis as of december  and ii million such lesser amount  the closing date equipment formula amount  provided that  commencing february   the closing date equipment formula amount is reduced monthly based on a seven year straight line monthly amortization schedule  minus d the availability reserve as defined in the credit agreement

effective as of july   the margin ranges from to on eurodollar rate loans and to on base rate loans  in each case based on the percentage that our average total outstanding borrowings under the facility bear to the aggregate commitments of the lenders under the facility currently million 
pursuant to the july amendment  the applicable margins are no longer subject to further reduction based on the company fixed charge coverage ratio 
the base rate is the highest of the prime lending rate of the administrative agent  the eurodollar rate for a day interest period plus  or the federal funds rate plus of 
the credit agreement provides for letter of credit fees ranging from to per annum based on the average quarterly availability as a percentage of the borrowing base  a letter of credit fronting fee equal to per annum  and a commitment fee payable on the unused portion of the facility  accruing at a rate per annum ranging from to based on the percentage that the average unused amount of the facility bears to the aggregate commitments of the lenders under the facility

table of contents the credit agreement contains affirmative  negative and financial covenants customary for such asset based financings that  among other things  limit the company s ability to make loans or investments including acquisitions and equity distributions cash dividends or repurchases of stock  prepay  redeem or purchase debt  incur liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions  incur additional indebtedness  engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates  and change our primary business 
in addition  the credit agreement does not limit the dollar amount of investments including acquisitions and equity distributions cash dividends or repurchases of stock so long as the company is not in default under the agreement and the availability under the facility on a proforma basis exceeds specified threshold amounts and in certain cases subject to our having a proforma fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than or equal to to 
the credit agreement does not contain any limitations on our ability to make capital expenditures 
the credit agreement also contains representations and warranties and events of default customary for agreements of this type 
if the amount of availability under the facility falls below certain specified threshold amounts  we are subject to a fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant as defined in the credit agreement for the preceding months period  which must not be less than to additionally  the credit agreement also contains a lockbox feature that will require that all qualified daily cash receipts be promptly applied to the repayment of outstanding borrowings under the facility only during a period commencing on the date in which the company s availability under the facility falls below certain threshold amounts or the date that an event of default occurs and continuing until the availability has exceeded such threshold amounts for days and no event of default has existed 
as of december   the company is compliant with all applicable covenants contained within the credit agreement 
during  borrowings under the credit agreement bore a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
in general  the credit agreement covenants are less restrictive than the previous agreement that it replaced and provides us with greater financial flexibility to manage and grow our business 
the credit agreement continues to be guaranteed by all of the company domestic subsidiaries and is collateralized by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets  intercompany debts  stock or other equity interests owned by the company and its domestic subsidiaries and a majority of the stock or other equity interests of certain of its foreign subsidiaries 
our operating cash flows are also the primary source for funding our contractual obligations 
the table below summarizes as of december   our major commitments in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases service agreements total the majority of the operating lease obligations relates to our intermodal segment s leases of railcars  containers and chassis  but also includes operating leases for tractors used in our local trucking operations 
each year a portion of the operating leases must be renewed or can be terminated based upon equipment requirements 
partially offsetting these lease payment requirements are railcar and container per diem revenues not reflected in the table above which were million in  million in  and million in as agreed under the november arrangements with union pacific  the rates payable by union pacific for use of our owned and leased railcars have been adjusted on average downward to car hire rates payable for similar ttx railcars  with such adjustment becoming effective as of december  operating leases for railcars contain provisions for automatic renewal for an additional five year period  resulting in a total lease term from lease inception of fifteen years 
the above table assumes the automatic renewal and the minimum lease payments reflect the term for the fifteen years from lease inception 
service agreements include a commitment for ongoing maintenance and support to information technology providers  a telecommunications commitment for voice  data and frame relay services  an it licensing  hosting and maintenance commitment  and our human resources benefit system and payroll processing contract 
based upon the current level of operations and the anticipated future growth in both of our operating segments  management believes that operating cash flow and availability under the credit agreement will be adequate to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and other cash needs during 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the company has financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments  or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities  or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to us 
inflation we contract with railroads and independent truck operators for our transportation requirements 
these third parties are responsible for providing their own diesel fuel 
to the extent that changes in fuel prices are passed along to us  we have generally passed these changes along to our customers 
there is no guarantee  however  that this will be possible in the future 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
recognition of revenue we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we maintain signed contracts with many of our customers and have bills of lading specifying shipment details  including the rates charged for our services 
our transportation service revenue is recognized after the services have been completed  meaning delivery has occurred and the shipping terms of the contract have been satisfied 
our warehousing  distribution and supply chain services revenues are recognized as the storage or service is rendered 
recognition of cost of purchased transportation and services our intermodal segment  our highway brokerage business and our international freight forwarding and nvocc services estimate the cost of purchased transportation and services and accrue an amount on a load by load basis in a manner that is consistent with revenue recognition 
our warehousing  distribution and supply chain services estimate the cost of services provided in a manner that is consistent with revenue recognition 
the amount to accrue on a load by load basis is based on current rate quotes or contracts with service providers 
to the extent the actual costs differ from the estimates  the difference is recognized in the period in which the actual cost becomes known 
unexpected or significant future changes could result in a material impact to future results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance has been established through an analysis of accounts receivable aging categories  historical collection experience with our customers  current economic conditions  and credit policies 
as we monitor our receivables  we identify customers that may have payment problems  adjusting the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly with an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when recovery is considered remote 
we review our receivables on a quarterly basis to ensure they are properly valued and collectible 
based on this review  we believe our related reserves are adequate 
while we believe our allowances are adequate  changes in the economic conditions  the financial health of our customers and bankruptcy settlements could impact our future earnings 
if the economic environment and market conditions deteriorate  particularly in the industries where our exposure is the greatest  additional reserves may be required 

table of contents historically  our actual losses have approximated estimated allowances 
however  unexpected or significant future events or changes in trends could result in a material impact to our future consolidated results of operations 
based on our results for the year ended december   a deviation from our estimated allowances would have resulted in an increase or decrease of expenses by approximately million 
useful lives of property and equipment depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of assets as follows classification estimated useful life rail cars to years containers and chassis to years autos trucks and revenue equipment to years leasehold improvements shorter of term of lease or life of improvement other including computer hardware and software and furniture and equipment to years when assets are sold  the applicable costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any gain or loss is included in income 
expenditures  including those on leased assets  which extend an asset s useful life or increase its utility  are capitalized and amortized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
accounting for income taxes and valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with current accounting standards 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings 
deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the more likely than not threshold  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 
significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax related contingencies on our provision for income taxes 
as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes  we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
for tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we record the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements 
such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments  whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates 
further  a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited or resolved 
at december   we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million which includes a valuation allowance of million 
we believe that future earnings will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets 
the minimum amount of future taxable income required to realize this asset is approximately million 
should we not be able to generate sufficient future income in and beyond  we may be required to record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
furthermore the year ended december  was the last year we were able to carryback any income tax losses to previous years 
as a result  the recoverability of our deferred tax assets will be dependent solely on our ability to generate future taxable income 
contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have interest rate exposure  primarily in the united states 
we manage interest exposure through floating rate debt 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposure when appropriate based on market conditions 
no interest rate swaps were outstanding at december  or based upon the average variable interest rate debt outstanding during  and  a basis point change in our variable interest rates would have affected our pre tax earnings by less than million  approximately million and approximately million  respectively 
as our foreign business expands  we will be subjected to greater foreign currency risk 
no derivative financial instruments were outstanding as of december  and we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes
