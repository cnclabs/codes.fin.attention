executive overview general we are a global consulting firm focusing on providing human capital and financial consulting services 
at towers watson  we bring together professionals from around the world experts in their areas of specialty to deliver the perspectives that give organizations a clear path forward 
we do this by working with clients to develop solutions in the areas of employee benefits  risk and capital management  and talent and rewards 
we help our clients enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees 
we focus on delivering consulting services that help organizations anticipate  identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management 
we also provide independent financial advice regarding all aspects of life insurance and general insurance  as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals 
we operate the largest private medicare exchange in the united states 
through this exchange  we help our clients to move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with retiree healthcare benefits 
as leading economies worldwide become more service oriented  human resources and financial management have become increasingly important to companies and other organizations 
the heightened competition for skilled employees  unprecedented changes in workforce demographics  regulatory changes related to compensation and retiree benefits  and rising employee related costs have increased the importance of effective human capital management 
insurance and investment decisions have become increasingly complex and important in the face of changing economies and dynamic financial markets 
towers watson helps its clients address these issues by combining expertise in human capital and financial management with consulting and technology solutions  to improve the design and implementation of various human resources and financial programs  including compensation  retirement  health care  and insurance and investment plans 
the human resources consulting industry  although highly fragmented  is highly competitive 
it is composed of major human capital consulting firms  specialty firms  consulting arms of accounting firms and information technology consulting firms 
in the short term  our revenue is driven by many factors  including the general state of the global economy and the resulting level of discretionary spending  the continuing regulatory compliance requirements of our clients  changes in investment markets  the ability of our consultants to attract new clients or provide additional services to existing clients  the impact of new regulations in the legal and accounting fields and the impact of our ongoing cost saving initiatives 
in the long term  we expect that our financial results will depend in large part upon how well we succeed in deepening our existing client relationships through thought leadership and a focus on developing cross business solutions  actively pursuing new clients in our target markets  cross selling and making strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the highly fragmented industry in which we operate offers us growth opportunities  because we provide a unique business combination of benefits and human capital consulting  as well as risk and capital management and strategic technology solutions 
segments we provide services in four business segments benefits  risk and financial services  talent and rewards  and exchange solutions 
benefits segment 
the benefits segment is our largest and most established segment 
this segment has grown through business combinations as well as strong organic growth 
it helps clients create and manage cost effective benefits programs that help them attract  retain and motivate a talented workforce 
the benefits segment provides benefits consulting and administration services through four lines of business retirement  health and group benefits  technology and administration solutions  and international consulting 
retirement supports organizations worldwide in designing  managing  administering and communicating all types of retirement plans 
health and group benefits provides advice on the strategy  design  financing  delivery  ongoing plan management and communication of health and group benefit programs 
through our technology and administration solutions line of business  we deliver cost effective benefit outsourcing solutions 
the international consulting group provides expertise in dealing with international human 
table of contents capital management and related benefits and compensation advice for corporate headquarters and their subsidiaries 
a significant portion of the revenue in this segment is from recurring work  driven in large part by the heavily regulated nature of employee benefits plans and our clients annual needs for these services 
for the fiscal year ended june   the benefits segment contributed of our segment revenue 
for the same period  approximately of the benefits segment s revenue originates from outside the united states and is thus subject to translation exposure resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
risk and financial services segment 
within the risk and financial services segment  our second largest segment  we have three lines of business risk consulting and software rcs  investment  and reinsurance and insurance brokerage brokerage 
the risk and financial services segment accounted for of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  approximately of the segment s revenue originates from outside the united states and is thus subject to translation exposure resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the segment has a strong base of recurring revenue  driven by long term client relationships in reinsurance brokerage services  retainer investment consulting relationships  software solutions  consulting services on financial reporting  and actuarial opinions on property casualty loss reserves 
some of these relationships have been in place for more than years 
a portion of the revenue is related to project work  which is more heavily dependent on the overall level of discretionary spending by clients 
this work is favorably influenced by strong client relationships  particularly related to mergers and acquisitions consulting 
major revenue growth drivers include changes in regulations  the level of merger and acquisition activity in the insurance industry  growth in pension and other asset pools  and reinsurance retention and pricing trends 
talent and rewards segment 
our third largest segment  talent and rewards  is focused on three lines of business executive compensation  rewards  talent and communication  and data  surveys and technology 
the talent and rewards segment accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  few of the segment s projects have a recurring element 
as a result  this segment is most sensitive to changes in discretionary spending due to cyclical economic fluctuations 
approximately of the segment s revenue originates from outside the united states and is thus subject to translation exposure resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
revenue for talent and rewards consulting has increasing seasonality  with a meaningful amount of heightened activity in the second half of the calendar year during the annual compensation  benefits and survey cycles 
major revenue growth drivers in this group include demand for workforce productivity improvements and labor cost reductions  focus on high performance culture  globalization of the workforce  changes in regulations and benefits programs  merger and acquisition activity  and the demand for universal metrics related to workforce engagement 
exchange solutions segment 
we established our fourth segment  exchange solutions  when we acquired extend health on may  the exchange solutions segment accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  exchange solutions operates the largest private medicare insurance exchange in the united states 
our core solution enables employers to transition their retirees to individual  defined contribution health plans at an annual cost that the employer controls versus group based  defined benefit health plans  which have uncertain annual costs 
by moving to a defined contribution approach  our clients can provide their retirees with the same or better health care benefits at a lower overall cost 
most exchange solutions revenues come from the commissions we receive from insurance carriers for enrolling individuals into their health plans 
this revenue increases as the number of enrolled members grows 
exchange solutions experiences seasonality due to the majority of policies beginning on january following corporations open enrollment periods 
in addition  the annual enrollment period for medicare eligible individuals coincides with this period 
it is expected that the majority of enrollments will occur in our second quarter and we will hire additional seasonal benefits advisors to supplement our full time benefit advisors and incur higher costs 
the associated commission revenue with these new enrollments is deferred until the policy effective date in our third quarter and is spread over the policy period 

table of contents financial statement overview towers watson s fiscal year ends june shown below are towers watson s top five geographies based on percentage of consolidated revenue 
fiscal year geographic region united states united kingdom canada germany netherlands we derive the majority of our revenue from fees for consulting services 
approximately of our client arrangements are billed at standard hourly rates and expense reimbursement  which we refer to as time and expense basis 
the remaining of our client arrangements are billed on a fixed fee basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis with revenue generally recognized as services are performed 
no single client accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for any of our most recent three fiscal years 
our most significant expense is compensation to associates  which typically comprises approximately of total costs of providing services 
we compensate our directors  executive officers and other select associates with incentive non cash stock based compensation plans which generally vest equally over three years 
we use a graded vesting expense methodology that assumes the equity awards are issued to participants in equal amounts of shares that vest over one year  two years and three years giving the effect of more expense in the first year than the second and third 
our equity awards are settled in towers watson class a common stock 
salaries and employee benefits are comprised of wages paid to associates  related taxes  severance  benefit expenses such as pension  medical and insurance costs  and fiscal year end incentive bonuses 
professional and subcontracted services represent fees paid to external service providers for employment  marketing and other services 
for the three most recent fiscal years  approximately to of the professional and subcontracted services were directly incurred on behalf of clients and were reimbursed by them  with such reimbursements being included in revenue 
for the fiscal year ended june  for towers watson  approximately of professional and subcontracted services represent these reimbursable services 
occupancy includes expenses for rent and utilities 
general and administrative expenses include legal  marketing  supplies  telephone and networking costs to operate office locations as well as insurance  including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims  non client reimbursed travel by associates  publications and professional development 
this line item also includes miscellaneous expenses  including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and internally developed software 
transaction and integration expenses include fees and charges associated with the merger and with our other acquisitions 
transaction and integration expenses principally consist of investment banker fees  regulatory filing expenses  integration consultants  as well as legal  accounting  marketing  and information technology integration expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients  discretionary compensation  income taxes  pension assumptions  incurred but not reported claims  and goodwill and intangible assets 
the critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies 
table of contents require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption 
different estimates that we could have used  or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is earned and realized or realizable as demonstrated by persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client  a fixed or determinable price  services have been rendered or products delivered or available for use  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue consists of fees earned from providing consulting services 
we recognize revenue from these consulting engagements when hours are worked  either on a time and expense basis or on a fixed fee basis  depending on the terms and conditions defined at the inception of an engagement with a client 
we have engagement letters with our clients that specify the terms and conditions upon which the engagements are based 
these terms and conditions can only be changed upon agreement by both parties 
individual associates billing rates are principally based on a multiple of salary and compensation costs 
revenue for fixed fee arrangements is based upon the proportional performance method 
we typically have three types of fixed fee arrangements annual recurring projects  projects of a short duration  and non recurring system projects 
annual recurring projects and the projects of short duration are typically straightforward and highly predictable in nature 
as a result  the project manager and financial staff are able to identify  as the project status is reviewed and bills are prepared monthly  the occasions when cost overruns could lead to the recording of a loss accrual 
we have non recurring system projects that are longer in duration and subject to more changes in scope as the project progresses 
we evaluate at least quarterly  and more often as needed  project managers estimates to complete to assure that the projects current statuses are accounted for properly 
certain software contracts generally provide that if the client terminates a contract  we are entitled to payment for services performed through termination 
revenue recognition for fixed fee engagements is affected by a number of factors that change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project such as changes in scope  the staffing on the engagement and or the level of client participation 
the periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stage of project completion that  in turn  affect how we recognize revenue 
we recognize a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated costs associated with the engagement 
losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we have experienced certain costs in excess of estimates from time to time 
management believes it is rare  however  for these excess costs to result in overall project losses 
we have developed various software programs and technologies that we provide to clients in connection with consulting services 
in most instances  such software is hosted and maintained by us and ownership of the technology and rights to the related code remain with us 
we defer costs for software developed to be utilized in providing services to a client  but for which the client does not have the contractual right to take possession  during the implementation stage 
we recognize these deferred costs from the go live date  signaling the end of the implementation stage  until the end of the initial term of the contract with the client 
we determined that the system implementation and customized ongoing administrative services are one combined service 
revenue is recognized over the service period  after the go live date  in proportion to the services performed 
as a result  we do not recognize revenue during the implementation phase of an engagement 
we deliver software under arrangements with clients that take possession of our software 
the maintenance associated with the initial software fees is a fixed percentage which enables us to determine the stand alone value of the delivered software separate from the maintenance 
we recognize the initial software fees as software is delivered to the client and we recognize the maintenance ratably over the contract period based on each element s relative fair value 
for software arrangements in which initial fees are received in connection with mandatory maintenance for the initial software license to remain active  we determined that the initial maintenance period is substantive 
therefore  we recognize the fees for the initial license and maintenance bundle ratably over the initial contract term  which is generally one year 
each subsequent renewal fee is recognized ratably over the contractually stated renewal period 
we collect  analyze and compile data in the form of surveys for our clients who have the option of participating in the survey 
the surveys are published online via a web tool which provides simplistic functionality 
we have determined that the web tool is inconsequential to the overall arrangement 
we record the survey revenue when the results are delivered online and made available to our clients that have a contractual right to the data 
if the data is updated more frequently than annually  we recognize the survey revenue ratably over the contractually stated period 
in our capacity as a reinsurance broker  we collect premiums from our reinsurance clients and  after deducting our brokerage commissions  we remit the premiums to the respective reinsurance underwriters on behalf of our reinsurance clients 
in general  compensation for reinsurance brokerage services is earned on a commission basis 
commissions are calculated as a percentage of a 
table of contents reinsurance premium as stipulated in the reinsurance contracts with our clients and reinsurers 
we recognize brokerage services revenue on the later of the contract s inception or billing date as fees become known or as our services are provided for premium processing 
in addition  we hold cash needed to settle amounts due reinsurers or our reinsurance clients  net of any commissions due to us  pending remittance to the ultimate recipient 
we are permitted to invest these funds in high quality liquid instruments 
as an insurance exchange  we generate revenue from commission paid to us by insurance carriers for health insurance policies issued through our enrollment services 
under our contracts with insurance carriers  once an application has been accepted by an insurance carrier and a policy has been issued  we will receive commission payments from the policy effective date until the end of the annual policy period as long as the policy is not cancelled by the insured or the carrier 
we defer upfront fees and recognize revenue ratably from the policy effective date over the policy period  generally one year 
the commission fee per policy placed with a carrier could vary by whether the insured was previously a medicare participant and whether the policy is in its first or subsequent year 
due to the uncertainty of the commission fee per policy  we do not recognize revenue until the policy is accepted by the carrier  the policy is effective and a communication is received from the carrier of the fee per insured 
as the commission fee is cancellable on a pro rata basis related to the underlying insurance policy which we are not party to  we recognize the commission fee ratably over the policy period 
our carrier contracts entitle us to receive commission fees per policy for the life of the policy unless limited by legislation or cancelled by the carrier or insured 
as a result  the majority of the revenue is recurring in nature and grows in direct proportion to the number of new policies added each year 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable 
cash collections in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
client reimbursable expenses  including those relating to travel  other out of pocket expenses and any third party costs  are included in revenue  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in professional and subcontracted services as a cost of revenue 
valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the clients failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered  including allowances when customer disputes may exist 
the related provision is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on the write off history 
facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due  general market conditions  current economic trends and our clients ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables 
discretionary compensation our compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and or deferred stock units after our annual operating results are finalized 
an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process 
estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted  if necessary  by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre bonus profitability for the year 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  which prescribes the use of the asset and liability approach to the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or income tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a given deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in accordance with asc  income tax expense includes i deferred tax expense  which generally represents the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any change in valuation allowances and ii current tax expense  which represents the amount of tax currently payable to or receivable from a taxing authority plus amounts accrued for expected tax contingencies including both tax and interest 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
we continually review tax laws  regulations and related guidance in order to properly record any uncertain tax positions 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
incurred but not reported ibnr claims we accrue for ibnr professional liability claims that are probable and estimable  and for which we have not yet contracted for insurance coverage 
we use actuarial assumptions to estimate and record a liability for ibnr professional liability claims 
our 
table of contents estimated ibnr liability is based on long term trends and averages  and considers a number of factors  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  and legislation and economic decisions 
our estimated ibnr liability does not include actuarial projections for the effect of claims data for large cases due to the insufficiency of actuarial experience with such cases 
our estimated ibnr liability will fluctuate if claims experience changes over time 
as of june   we had a million ibnr liability  net of recoverable receivables of our captive insurance companies 
this net liability decreased from million as of june  as the result of improved claims experience 
to the extent our captive insurance companies  pcic and smic  expect losses to be covered by a third party  they record a receivable for the amount expected to be recovered 
this receivable is classified in other current or other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
pension assumptions towers watson sponsors both qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefit plan opeb plans in north america and europe 
as of june   these funded and unfunded plans represented percent of towers watson s pension and opeb obligations and are disclosed herein 
towers watson also sponsors funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries  representing an additional million in projected benefit obligations  million in assets and a net liability of million 
north america united states beginning january   all associates  including named executive officers  accrue qualified and non qualified benefits under a new stable value pension design 
prior to this date  associates hired prior to december  earned benefits under their legacy plan formulas  which were frozen on december  the non qualified plan is unfunded 
retiree medical benefits provided under our us postretirement benefit plans were closed to new hires effective january  life insurance benefits under the same plans were frozen with respect to service  eligibility and amounts as of january  for active associates 
canada effective on january   associates hired on or after january  and effective on january  for associates hired prior to january   accrue qualified and non qualified benefits based on a career average benefit formula 
additionally  participants can choose to make voluntary contributions to purchase enhancements to their pension 
prior to the january   associates earned benefits under their legacy plan formulas 
the non qualified plans in north america provide for the additional pension benefits that would be covered under the qualified plan in the respective country were it not for statutory maximums 
the non qualified plans are unfunded 
europe united kingdom for associates previously participating under the legacy watson wyatt defined benefit plan  benefits accrue based on the number of years of service and the associate s average compensation during the associate s term of service since january prior to this date  benefits accrued under a different formula 
benefit accruals earned under the legacy towers perrin defined benefit plan were frozen on march   and the plan predominantly provides lump sum benefits 
all associates not earning benefits under the legacy watson wyatt defined benefit component of the plan accrue benefits under a defined contribution component 
germany effective january   all new associates participate in a defined contribution plan 
associates hired prior to this date continue to participate in various defined contribution and defined benefit arrangements according to legacy plan formulas 
the legacy defined benefit plans are primarily account based  with some long service associates continuing to accrue benefits according to grandfathered final average pay formulas 
netherlands benefits under the netherlands plan used to accrue on a final pay basis on earnings up to a maximum amount each year 
the benefit accrual under the final pay plan stopped at december  the accrued benefits will receive conditional indexation each year 
the determination of towers watson s obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that  given the longevity of the plans  are long term in focus 
a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on towers watson s pension benefit obligation and related cost 
any difference between actual and assumed results is amortized into towers watson s pension cost over the average remaining service period of participating associates 
towers watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions  including economic forecasts  relevant benchmarks  historical trends  portfolio composition and peer company comparisons 

table of contents funding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes 
since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes  pension contributions are not equal to net periodic pension cost 
the assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal years ended june   and were as follows year ended june  north america europe north america europe north america europe discount rate expected long term rate of return on assets rate of increase in compensation levels the following table presents the assumptions used in the valuation to determine the projected benefit obligation for the fiscal years ended june  and june  june  north america europe north america europe discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels as a result of plan changes adopted during the first quarter of fiscal year  the legacy watson wyatt us pension plans were remeasured as of september  upon remeasurement the discount rate assumption was changed for these plans and the net periodic benefit cost for the remainder of fiscal year was calculated using a weighted average discount rate of 
towers watson s discount rate assumptions were determined by matching expected future pension benefit payments with current aa corporate bond yields from the respective countries for the same periods 
in the united states  specific bonds were selected to match plan cash flows 
in canada  yields were taken from a corporate bond yield curve 
in europe  the discount rate was set based on yields on european aa corporate bonds at the measurement date 
the uk is based on the uk aa corporate bonds  while germany and the netherlands are based on european aa corporate bonds 
the expected rates of return assumptions for north america and europe were supported by an analysis performed by towers watson of the weighted average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the north american pension plans for fiscal year change in assumption effect on fy pre tax pension expense basis point decrease in discount rate million basis point increase in discount rate million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

table of contents the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the european pension plans for fiscal year change in assumption effect on fy pre tax pension expense basis point decrease in discount rate million basis point increase in discount rate million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the differences in the discount rate and compensation level assumption used for the north american and european plans above can be attributed to the differing interest rate environments associated with the currencies and economies to which the plans are subject 
the differences in the expected return on assets are primarily driven by the respective asset allocation in each plan  coupled with the return expectations for assets in the respective currencies 
goodwill and intangible assets in applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations  amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of april  and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of april  and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below our operating segments 
the company had ten reporting units on april  during fiscal  the company adopted asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  which gives entities testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
during this assessment  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset  specifically some of our trade names  is less than its carrying amount 
qualitative factors we consider include  but are not limited to  cost factors  financial performance  legal  regulatory  contractual  political  business and other factors  including asset specific factors  industry and market conditions  and macroeconomic conditions 
if the qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  we perform the two step process to assess our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment 
during fiscal year  we assessed the qualitative factors and determined that the two step impairment test was not required for our indefinite lived intangible assets 
during fiscal  the company also performed a qualitative assessment for seven of our ten reporting units 
similar to our indefinite lived intangible assets  during this assessment  we first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
qualitative factors we consider include  but are not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  company specific events  changes in circumstances  after tax cash flows and market capitalization 
if the qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we perform the two step process to assess our goodwill for impairment 
during fiscal year  we assessed the qualitative factors and determined that the two step impairment test was not required for the seven reporting units reviewed 
during fiscal  the company performed step of the two step impairment test for three of our ten reporting units 
to perform this test  we used level valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that fall under income or market approaches 
under the discounted cash flow method  an income approach  the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt free after tax cash flows for a finite period of years 
key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management  business risk  and expected rate of return on capital 
the guideline company method  a market approach  develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies 
key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies  obtaining estimates of forecasted revenue and ebitda estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics 
under the similar transactions method  a market approach  actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units 

table of contents if the company was required to perform step  we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit used in step one to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired 
for the fiscal year ended june   we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles 
results of operations the table below sets forth our consolidated statements of operations and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated

in addition  several successes contributed to our growth in fiscal year we assisted companies with de risking activities related to bulk lump sum projects 
we enhanced our client development group outside the us to better align our organization with our multi national and global clients and expanded our global footprint into rapidly developing markets such as south africa  india and russia 
on an organic basis  which excludes the effects of acquisitions and currency  revenue increased for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  all of our segments experienced constant currency revenue growth in fiscal year compared to 
table of contents the average exchange rate used to translate our revenues earned in british pounds sterling decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year  and the average exchange rate used to translate our revenues earned in euros increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal constant currency is calculated by translating prior year revenue at the current year average exchange rate 
a comparison of segment revenue for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the fiscal year ended june   is as follows benefits revenue increased million  or  and was billion for fiscal year compared to billion for fiscal year on a constant currency basis  benefits revenue increased due to increased project work across all lines of business 
the increase in our retirement business revenue  which makes up the majority of the segment  was driven by revenue growth in the americas  primarily due to bulk lump sum projects 
we do not expect the same volume for bulk lump sum projects in fiscal year the increase in retirement revenue in emea was due to an increase in auto enrollment project activity in the uk our technology and administration solutions business experienced revenue growth primarily due to new client work in the uk and germany 
the growth in emea was driven by new administration work  and the growth in the americas was due in part to call center support for the bulk lump sum projects 
our international business experienced revenue growth 
this group helps to address the issues multinationals face in their compensation and benefits programs 
our health and group benefits business experienced growth 
in fiscal year  we anticipate low single digit revenue growth for our benefits segment led by technology and administration solutions while our retirement business will be challenging because of the strong comparable in fiscal year revenue in our benefits segment increased on an organic basis  which excludes the effects of acquisitions and currency 
risk and financial services revenue was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  a decrease 
risk and financial services revenue increased on a constant currency basis 
our lines of business experienced mixed results  with revenue growth in the americas  while emea remained flat 
our investment business had constant currency revenue growth led by emea  due to an increase in project work and performance fees 
our risk consulting and software business has two distinct offerings  software and consulting  each of which experienced different results in fiscal year our software sales increased due to our portfolio of software solutions for both life and property and casualty insurance 
our consulting services revenue  which is primarily project oriented  decreased due to tightening of discretionary spending  principally in emea 
in addition  it appears likely that the timeline for european regulators to implement solvency ii will slip beyond and related project work may not reappear for some time 
as a result  our risk consulting and software business had a constant currency decrease in revenue in fiscal year compared to our brokerage revenue increased on a constant currency basis due to strong renewals and new business wins during our january renewals 
we believe that risk and financial services has moved into a more challenging environment 
we anticipate discretionary spending to continue to affect the risk consulting and software business and we expect the investment business to continue to deliver strong revenue growth 
revenue in our risk and financial services segment increased on an organic basis 
talent and rewards revenue remained consistent and was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year we achieved organic growth in all regions and in the executive compensation and data  surveys and technology lines of business 
the organic revenue growth in our executive compensation business was led by emea

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes for fiscal year was million  compared to million for fiscal year the effective tax rate was for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year our effective tax rate decreased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to a change in the mix of income between foreign and us operations  and the release of valuation allowance in foreign jurisdictions  offset by the reduction of tax loss carryforwards that cannot be utilized following legal entity restructurings 
beginning in fiscal year  the company no longer provides deferred taxes on current or future earnings with respect to the acquired towers perrin canadian subsidiary 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investments requirements  necessitate that foreign earnings be distributed  an additional provision for us income and foreign withholding taxes  net of foreign tax credits  may be necessary 
net income attributable to controlling interests net income attributable to controlling interests for the fiscal year ended june  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share for fiscal year was  compared to for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our most significant sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities  available cash and cash equivalents  and our credit facility 
consistent with our liquidity position  management considers various alternative strategic uses of cash reserves including acquisitions  dividends and stock buybacks  or any combination of these options 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to fund operations beyond the next months 
the key variables that we manage in response to current and projected capital resource needs include credit facilities and short term borrowing arrangements  working capital and our stock repurchase program 
our cash and cash equivalents at june  totaled million  compared to million at june  the increase in cash flows in fiscal was due to higher net income and from less cash used in business acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by lower cash inflows from borrowings 
in fiscal year  we paid million in cash in conjunction with the acquisition of extend health  which was financed by borrowings under the senior credit facility and a new million term loan facility the term loan 
our cash and cash equivalents balance includes million from the consolidated balance sheets of pcic and smic  which is available for payment of professional liability and other claims reserves 
as a result  we have a net million of cash that is available for our general use 
our fiduciary assets totaled million at june   compared to million at june  of this amount  million is related to our reinsurance brokerage business and million is related to our health and welfare benefits administration outsourcing business 
while we are permitted to invest such cash in high quality investments and earn investment income on these holdings  all amounts are held in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of insureds  reinsurers or clients and are not available for other general use by the company 
our non us operations are substantially self sufficient for their working capital needs 
as of june   million of towers watson s total cash and cash equivalents balance of million was held outside of the united states 
should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our us operations  we may decide to make additional borrowings under our senior credit facility  repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense 
we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside the us to have a material effect on the company s overall liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  the company changed its asc  income taxes  assertion with respect to our uk subsidiary and repatriated million from its uk subsidiary 
the change in assertion is primarily due to changes in foreign cash and liquidity requirements 

table of contents asc  income taxes  requires a company to recognize income tax expense when it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary will be remitted in the foreseeable future 
the us tax cost from the uk repatriation was insignificant due to available foreign tax credits from the dividend equivalent to the us statutory tax rate 
we have not provided us federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our other foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
it is not practicable to estimate the us federal income tax liability that might be payable if such earnings are not invested indefinitely 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be repatriated  an additional provision for us income and foreign withholding taxes  net of foreign tax credits  may be necessary 
assets and liabilities associated with non us entities have been translated into us dollars as of june   at us dollar rates that fluctuate compared to historical periods 
as a result  cash flows derived from changes in the consolidated balance sheets include the impact of the change in foreign exchange translation rates 
events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results  potential future acquisitions  material changes in geographic sources of cash  unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities were million for fiscal year compared to cash flows from operating activities of million for fiscal year this increase of million is primarily attributable to an increase in net income before non controlling interests of million and the increase in cash flows from accounts receivable collections of million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year our billed and unbilled accounts receivable balances decreased million from june  to june  despite our revenue growth for the same period 
our erp system has been fully implemented and our number of days of accounts receivable outstanding has returned to expected levels 
the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased million from june  to june  the number of days of accounts receivable outstanding decreased to at june  compared to at june  cash flows used in investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal year were million  compared to million for fiscal year this decrease in cash used is primarily due to million of cash paid in fiscal year for the acquisition of extend health 
cash flows used in from financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal year were million  compared to cash flows from financing activities of million in fiscal year the decrease in cash flows of million was primarily due to higher repayments and lower borrowings under our senior credit facility and our term loan in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  the average outstanding balance on our senior credit facility was million  and the largest outstanding balance was million

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations remaining payments by fiscal year due as of june  contractual cash obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years term loan lease commitments operating leases 
we lease office space under operating lease agreements with terms typically averaging years 
we have determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year 
consequently  management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense on leases will be mainly market driven 
while the future operating lease payments presented above are not recognized on our balance sheet  we do have certain assets and liabilities related to these leases in the form of deferred rent accruals and intangible assets and liabilities 
the intangible assets and liabilities were recognized for the difference between the contractual cash obligations shown above and the estimated market rates at the time of certain past acquisitions 
the resulting intangibles will amortize to rent expense but do not impact the amounts shown above since there is no change to our contractual cash obligations 
pension contribution 
contributions to our qualified pension plans for fiscal year are projected to be million 
additionally  the company expects to pay million in benefits directly to participants under our non qualified plans for fiscal uncertain tax positions 
the table above does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions under asc  income taxes 
the settlement period for the million liability  which excludes interest and penalties  cannot be reasonably estimated since it depends on the timing and possible outcomes of tax examinations with various tax authorities

during fiscal  the weighted average interest rate on the senior credit facility was 
we are charged a quarterly commitment fee  currently of the senior credit facility  which varies with our financial leverage and is paid on the unused portion of the senior credit facility 
obligations under the senior credit facility are guaranteed by towers watson and all of its domestic subsidiaries other than our captive insurance companies 
the senior credit facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants 
the senior credit facility requires towers watson to maintain certain financial covenants that include a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio which terms in each case are defined in the senior credit facility 
in addition  the senior credit facility contains restrictions on the ability of towers watson to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make distributions  create liens on assets  make acquisitions  dispose of property  engage in sale leaseback transactions  engage in mergers or consolidations  liquidations and dissolutions  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  and make changes in lines of businesses

a limit of million per claim and in the aggregate was provided by pcic subject to a million per claim self insured retention 
pcic secured reinsurance of million attaching above the million pcic retained layer 
in addition  both legacy companies carried excess insurance from unaffiliated commercial insurance companies above the self insured retention and the coverage provided by pcic 
our ownership interest in pcic is post merger 
as a consequence  pcic s results of operations are consolidated into our results of operations 
although the pcic insurance policies for towers watson s fiscal year continue to cover professional liability claims above a million per claim self insured retention  the consolidation of pcic will effectively net pcic s premium income against our premium expense for the first million of loss above the self insured retention for each legacy company 
accordingly  the impact of pcic s reserve development may result in fluctuations in our earnings 
pcic ceased issuing insurance policies effective july  and at that time entered into a run off mode of operation 
our shareholder agreements with pcic could require additional payments to pcic if development of claims significantly exceeds prior expectations 
we provide for the self insured retention where specific estimated losses and loss expenses for known claims are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
although we maintain professional liability insurance coverage  this insurance does not cover claims made after expiration of our current policies of insurance 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims if they are probable and reasonably estimable  and for which we have not yet contracted for insurance coverage 
we use actuarial assumptions to estimate and record our ibnr liability 
as of june   we had a million ibnr liability  net of recoverable receivables of our captive insurance companies 
this net liability decreased from million as of june  as the result of improved claims experience 
to the extent our captive insurance companies  pcic and smic  expect losses to be covered by a third party  they record a receivable for the amount expected to be recovered 
this receivable is classified in other current or other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
insurance market conditions for us and our industry have varied in recent years  but the long term trend has been increasing premium cost 
although the market for professional liability insurance is presently reasonably accessible  trends toward higher self insured 
table of contents retentions  constraints on aggregate excess coverage for this class of professional liability risk and financial difficulties which have  over the past few years  been faced by several longstanding e o carriers  are anticipated to recur periodically  and to be reflected in our future annual insurance renewals 
as a result  we will continue to assess our ability to secure future insurance coverage  and we cannot assure that such coverage will continue to be available in the event of adverse claims experience  adverse loss trends  market capacity constraints or other factors 
in light of increasing litigation worldwide  including litigation against professionals  we have a policy that all client relationships be documented by engagement letters containing specific risk mitigation clauses that were not included in all historical client agreements 
certain contractual provisions designed to mitigate risk may not be legally enforceable in litigation involving breaches of fiduciary duty or certain other alleged errors or omissions  or in certain jurisdictions 
we may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted on february   the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires entities to disclose additional information about items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the requirements include by component disclosures of changes in aoci balances along with the related income tax benefit or expense and significant items reclassified out of aoci 
asu is effective for annual periods  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and the amendments are to be applied prospectively 
while early adoption is permitted  the company plans to adopt the new requirements in its reporting for the first quarter of the company s fiscal year the company expects no material impact to its financial statements as a result of adopting this provision 
on june   the fasb issued asu  financial services investment companies topic amendments to the scope  measurement  and disclosure requirements  which amends the criteria an entity would need to meet to qualify as an investment company under asc the asu introduces new disclosure requirements that apply to all investment companies and amends the measurement criteria for certain interests in other investment companies 
the asu also amends the requirements in asc related to qualifying for the investment company deferral in asu as well as the requirements in asc related to qualifying for the net asset value practical expedient in asu we manage certain funds that are considered variable interest entities and for which our management fee is considered a variable interest 
these funds qualify for the investment company deferral in asu and therefore are subject to the consolidation guidance prior to the issuance of asu the asu is effective for interim and annual periods that begin after december   and early adoption is prohibited 
the company is currently evaluating whether these funds will continue to qualify for the investment company deferral based on the amended investment company criteria proscribed by asu on july   the fasb issued asu  presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists  which requires an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward  similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward 
to the extent the tax benefit is not available at the reporting date under the governing tax law or if the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose  the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability and not combined with deferred tax assets 
asu is effective for annual periods  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the amendments are to be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date and may be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented 
while early adoption is permitted  the company plans to adopt the new requirements in its reporting for the first quarter of the company s fiscal year the company expects no material impact to its financial statements as a result of adopting this provision 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business 
these risks include interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange and translation risk 
interest rate risk we are primarily exposed to changes in short term interest rates globally with respect to the return on our cash and short term investments  and in the united states with respect to our cost of borrowing under our term loan and revolving credit facility 
because of our desire for flexibility with respect to our investment balances  and our primary objective of preservation of principal  we primarily invest our portfolios in short term securities that are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 

table of contents we monitor our cost of borrowing under our various facilities  taking into account the seasonal nature of our funding requirements  and our expectation for short term rates in the future 
we have material pension obligations that are impacted by interest rates 
in recent years  the declining interest rate environment has resulted in lower discount rates  one of the main assumptions used in valuing a pension plan 
as discount rates are determined by corporate bond yields  significant changes in the bond market can adversely affect our discount rate  which in turn increases our pension liabilities 
foreign currency risk for the fiscal year ended june   of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  typically in the local currency of our foreign operations 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency and our primary international operations use the british pound sterling  canadian dollar and the euro 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
at june   a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in net income attributable to controlling interests of million  or  for the fiscal year ended june  this theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
this calculation is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions 
translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations and may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
certain of towers watson s foreign subsidiaries  primarily in the united kingdom  receive revenue in currencies that differ from their functional currencies 
to reduce this variability  towers watson uses foreign exchange forward contracts and has the ability to use over the counter options to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted collections 
see note  derivative financial instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k for a further discussion of our foreign currency forwards and their fair market value 
we consolidate our international subsidiaries by converting them into us dollars in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles of foreign currency translation 
the results of operations and our financial position will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates
