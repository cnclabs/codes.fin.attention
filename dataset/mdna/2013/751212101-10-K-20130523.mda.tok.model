our license agreements with each of these licensing partners will terminate in june  at which point we will assume control over the related product distribution 
product design our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of american style with a strong international appeal 
our consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an important contributor to the prominence  strength  and reputation of the ralph lauren brands 
our ralph lauren products are designed by  or under the direction of  mr 
ralph lauren and our design staff 
we form design teams around our brands and product categories to develop concepts  themes  and products for each brand and category 
through close collaboration with merchandising  sales  and production staff  these teams support all three segments of our business wholesale  retail  and licensing in order to gain market and other valuable input 
marketing and advertising our marketing and advertising programs communicate the themes and images of our brands and are integral to our product offering 
the majority of our advertising program is created and executed on a centralized basis through our in house creative and advertising organization to ensure consistency of presentation  which is complemented by our marketing experts in each region who help to execute our international strategies 
we create distinctive image advertising for our brands  conveying the particular message of each one within the context of the overall ralph lauren aesthetic 
advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of products offered by ourselves and  in some cases  our licensing partners 
our primary advertising medium is print  with multiple page advertisements appearing regularly in a range of fashion  lifestyle  and general interest magazines 
major print advertising campaigns are conducted during the fall and spring retail seasons  with additions throughout the year to coincide with product deliveries 
in addition to print  we utilize television and outdoor media in certain of our marketing programs 
we also market our brand through direct to consumer marketing  special events  and interactive digital activities 
we use our consumer database and consumer knowledge to guide these activities 
our digital advertising programs focus on high impact and innovative digital media outlets  which allow us to convey our key brand messages and lifestyle positioning 
we also develop digital editorial initiatives that allow for deeper education and engagement around the ralph lauren lifestyle  including the ralph lauren magazine  style guides  and brand videos 
we deploy these marketing and advertising initiatives through the internet  mobile platforms  and social media 
our e commerce sites present the ralph lauren lifestyle on the internet while offering a broad array of our apparel  accessories  and home product lines 
we advertise in consumer and trade print and digital media  and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of our retail and licensing partners 
we also provide point of sale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations 
in addition  when our licensing partners are required to spend an amount equal to a percent of their licensed product sales on advertising  we coordinate the advertising placement on their behalf 
we believe our investments in shop within shop environments and retail stores  including our flagship locations worldwide  contribute to and enhance the themes of our brands to consumers 
we expensed approximately million related to the advertising  marketing  and promotion of our products in fiscal we also conduct a variety of public relations activities 
each of our spring and fall womenswear collections are presented at major fashion shows in new york city  which typically generate extensive domestic and international media coverage 
we introduce each of the spring and fall menswear collections at press presentations in major cities such as new york and milan 
in addition  we organize in store appearances by our models and certain professional athletes 
we continue to be the exclusive outfitter for all on court officials at the wimbledon tennis tournament and the official outfitter of all on court officials at the us open tennis tournament 
both tournaments provide worldwide exposure for our brand in a relevant lifestyle environment 
we also continue to be the exclusive official parade outfitter for the us olympic and paralympic teams with the right to manufacture  distribute  advertise  promote  and sell products in the us which replicate the parade outfits and associated leisure wear 
as part of our involvement with team usa  we have established a partnership with athletes serving as brand ambassadors and as the faces of our advertising  marketing  and public relations campaigns 
in january  we entered into a five year agreement with the united states golf association usga to be the official apparel outfitter for the usga and the us open championships and serve as the championship s largest on site apparel supplier 
additionally  in  we entered into a five year agreement with the royal ancient to become an official patron of the open championship that is played annually on british links golf courses 
as part of this agreement  we are outfitting all officials and staff members at the open championship and are serving as the championship s largest on site apparel retailer 
we believe our partnerships with prestigious global tournaments reinforce our brand s sporting heritage 
sourcing  production and quality we contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any production facilities 
over different manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel  footwear  accessories  and home products  with no one manufacturer providing more than approximately of our total production during fiscal we source both finished products and raw materials 
raw materials include fabric  buttons  and other trim 
finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers 
in fiscal  less than of our products by dollar value were produced in the us  and over of our products by dollar value were produced outside the us  primarily in asia  europe  and latin america 
see import restrictions and other government regulations and item a risk factors risks related to our business our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials  freight  or labor or a manufacturer s inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications 
most of our businesses must commit to manufacture our garments before we sell finished goods  whether to wholly owned retail stores or to wholesale customers 
we also must commit to purchase fabric from mills well in advance of our sales 
if we overestimate our primary customers demand for a particular product or the need for a particular fabric or yarn  we may sell the excess products or garments made from such fabric or yarn in our factory stores or through secondary distribution channels 
suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in asia  the americas  the middle east  and europe 
all products are produced according to our specifications 
production and quality control staff in asia  the americas  the middle east  and europe monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product 
procedures have been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance programs so that quality assurance is reviewed early in the production process  allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption 
competition competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate 
we compete with numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel and accessories  fragrances  and home furnishing products  both domestic and international 
some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than us 
we compete primarily on the basis of fashion  quality  value  and service  which depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely manner  maintain favorable brand recognition  loyalty  and reputation for quality  develop and produce high quality products that appeal to consumers  appropriately source raw materials at cost effective prices  appropriately price our products  provide strong and effective marketing support  ensure product availability  and obtain additional points of distribution and sufficient retail floor space  and effectively present our products at retail 
see item a risk factors risks relating to the industry in which we compete we face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate 
distribution to facilitate global distribution  our products are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution centers around the world for inspection  sorting  packing  and delivery to retail and wholesale customers 
this network includes the following primary distribution facilities geographic region facility type facility location facility ownership us wholesale and retail distribution center greensboro  north carolina owned wholesale distribution center high point  north carolina leased e commerce distribution center high point  north carolina leased distribution center chino hills  california third party distribution center miami  florida third party canada distribution center toronto  ontario third party europe distribution center parma  italy third party japan distribution center yokohama  japan third party south korea distribution center bugok  south korea leased greater china and southeast asia distribution centers hong kong  china  singapore  malaysia  and taiwan third party latin america distribution centers uruguay and panama third party this distribution center performs customer order fulfillment for ralphlauren 
com and clubmonaco 
com 
in october  we entered into an agreement to purchase and expand this distribution center  which is expected to be completed in september this distribution center performs customer order fulfillment for our european businesses  including our e commerce operations in europe 
this distribution center performs customer order fulfillment for our japanese businesses  including our e commerce operations in japan 
includes china  hong kong  macau  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  taiwan  and thailand 
all facilities are designed to allow for high density cube storage and value added services  and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to facilitate process control and inventory management 
the distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems 
management information systems our management information systems make the design  marketing  manufacturing  importing  and distribution of our products more efficient by providing  among other things comprehensive order processing  production and design information  accounting information  and an enterprise view of information for our design  marketing  manufacturing  importing  and distribution functions 
the point of sale registers in conjunction with other systems in our stores enable us to track inventory from store receipt to final sale on a real time basis 
we believe our merchandising and financial systems  coupled with our point of sale registers and software programs  allow for stock replenishment  effective merchandise planning  and real time inventory and sales accounting 
in the us and europe  we utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our retail segment and wholesale customers  the movement of goods through distribution channels  and the collection of information for planning and forecasting 
in the us and europe  we also utilize an automated allocation system to facilitate the flow of inventory for our retail segment 
we are in the process of implementing a new global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes 
the implementation of this global system  scheduled to occur in phases over the next several years  began with the migration of certain of our domestic human resource systems during fiscal and continued with the transition of certain of our domestic operational and financial systems to the new global operating and financial reporting system during fiscal during fiscal  we continued to develop and enhance those operational and financial systems previously transitioned to the new global operating and financial reporting system 
the next phase of this implementation effort involves the migration of certain core areas of our business to the new system  including global merchandise procurement  and customer order management and record to report for our north american wholesale operations  beginning in fiscal see item a risk factors risks related to our business implementation of management information systems may negatively impact our business and risk factors risks related to our business our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively 
wholesale credit control we manage our own credit function 
we sell our merchandise principally to major department stores and extend credit based on an evaluation of the wholesale customer s financial capacity and condition  usually without requiring collateral 
we monitor credit levels and the financial condition of our wholesale customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk 
we do not factor or underwrite our accounts receivables  or maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of bad debts 
in north america  collection and deduction transactional activities are provided through a third party service provider 
see item a risk factors risks related to our business our business could be negatively impacted by any financial instability of our customers 
wholesale backlog we generally receive wholesale orders for apparel products approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers 
such orders are generally subject to broad cancellation rights 
our total backlog was approximately billion as of march  and march  we expect that substantially all of our backlog orders as of march  will be filled within the next fiscal year 
the size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors  including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments  which varies from year to year with consideration for holidays  consumer trends  concept plans  and the basic stock replenishment programs usage 
as a consequence  a comparison of the size of our order backlog from period to period may not be meaningful  nor may it be indicative of eventual shipments 
trademarks we own the ralph lauren  polo  polo by ralph lauren design  and the famous polo player astride a horse trademarks in the us and approximately countries worldwide 
other trademarks that we similarly own include purple label  black label  blue label  rrl  lauren ralph lauren  pink pony  rlx  denim supply ralph lauren  lauren  ralph  chaps  club monaco  rugby  american living  and various trademarks pertaining to fragrances and cosmetics 
mr 
ralph lauren has the royalty free right to use as trademarks ralph lauren  double rl  and rrl in perpetuity in connection with  among other things  beef and living animals 
the trademarks double rl and rrl are currently used by the double rl company  an entity wholly owned by mr 
lauren 
in addition  mr 
lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions not including or relating to our business through rrl productions  inc  a company wholly owned by mr 
lauren 
any activity by these companies has no impact on us 
our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel  apparel related products  home furnishings  restaurant and caf services  online services and online publications  and beauty products  as well as in connection with retail services  and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks 
in general  trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed 
we regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and  on a worldwide basis  vigorously seek to protect them against infringement 
as a result of the appeal of our trademarks  our products have been the object of counterfeiting 
while we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the sale of counterfeit products in the us and in most major markets abroad  we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark infringement in certain parts of asia 
in markets outside of the us  our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established 
in the course of our international expansion  we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks  including polo and or a representation of a polo player design  which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks 
while such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion  we have  in general  successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third party owners of the conflicting marks see item a risk factors risks related to our business our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the us and item legal proceedings for further discussion 
although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets  we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets 
import restrictions and other government regulations virtually all of our merchandise imported into the americas  europe  and asia is subject to duties 
in addition  most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and duties to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption 
the us and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported from china or other countries at unfairly traded prices in such increased quantities that would cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry generally known as anti dumping actions 
if dumping is suspected in the us  the us government may self initiate a dumping case on behalf of the us textile industry which could significantly affect our costs 
furthermore  additional duties  generally known as countervailing duties  can also be imposed by the us government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a us industry 
legislative proposals have been introduced which  if adopted  would treat a manipulation by china of the value of its currency as actionable under the anti dumping or countervailing duty laws 
we are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations  such as the north american free trade agreement  the central american free trade agreement  the caribbean basin initiative  and other special trade programs 
a portion of our imported products are eligible for certain of these duty advantaged programs 
in addition  each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports 
because the us and the other countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may  from time to time  impose new duties  tariffs  surcharges  or other import controls or restrictions  including the imposition of a safeguard quota  or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels  we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities 
we seek to minimize our potential exposure to import related risks through  among other measures  adjustments in product design and fabrication  shifts of production among countries and manufacturers  and through geographical diversification of our sources of supply 
as almost all our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers  the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations  executive action affecting textile agreements  or changes in sourcing patterns resulting from the elimination of quotas could adversely affect our operations 
on january   the world trade organization member nations lifted all quotas on apparel and textiles 
as a result  all textiles and apparel manufactured in each member nation and exported after january  are no longer subject to quota restrictions 
although we generally expect that the elimination of quotas will result  over the long term  in an overall reduction in the cost of apparel produced abroad  the implementation of any safeguard quota provisions  any anti dumping or countervailing duty actions  or any other actions impacting international trade may result  in the near term  in cost increases and in disruption of the supply chain for certain product categories 
see item a risk factors risks related to our business our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials  freight  or labor  or a manufacturer inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications and risk factors risks related to our business our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal  regulatory  political and economic risks 
apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulation in the us and other countries by other governmental agencies  including  in the us  the federal trade commission  us fish and wildlife service  and the consumer products safety commission  including the consumer product safety improvement act  which imposes limitations on the permissible amounts of lead and phthalates allowed in children products 
these regulations relate principally to product labeling  licensing requirements  flammability testing  and product safety particularly with respect to products used by children 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations  as well as applicable federal  state  local  and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment 
we do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the next fiscal year or in the near future 
our licensed products  licensing partners  buying sourcing agents  and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation 
our agreements require our licensing partners  buying sourcing agents  vendors  and factories to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations  and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
we are also subject to new disclosure and reporting requirements  established under existing or new federal or state laws  such as the requirements to identify the origin and existence of certain conflict minerals under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  and disclosures of abusive labor practices in portions of our supply chain under the california transparency in supply chains act  which could increase the cost of doing business  adversely affecting our results of operations 
although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past  we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets 
employees as of march   we had approximately  employees  including approximately  full time and approximately  part time employees 
approximately  of our employees are located in the us and approximately  are located in foreign countries 
approximately of our us production and distribution employees in the womenswear business are members of amalgamated ladies garment cutters union  local unite which was previously known as unite here under an industry association collective bargaining agreement  which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted

any of the following risk factors could materially adversely affect our business  our prospects  our results of operations  our financial condition  our liquidity  the trading prices of our securities  and or the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this report 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations in future periods or if circumstances change 
risks related to our business the loss of the services of mr 
ralph lauren  members of our executive management  or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
mr 
ralph lauren s leadership in the design  marketing  and operational areas of our business has been a critical element of our success since the inception of our company 
mr 
lauren is instrumental to  and closely identified with  our brand that bears his name 
our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr 
lauren s name may be damaged if we were to lose his services 
we depend on the service and management experience of mr 
lauren and other key executive officers  who have substantial experience and expertise in our industry and our business 
the death or disability of mr 
lauren or other extended or permanent loss of his services  or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our other executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success 
the loss of the services of mr 
roger farah  our president and chief operating officer  or one or more of our other key personnel  or the concurrent loss of several of these individuals  could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are not protected by a material amount of key man or similar life insurance covering mr 
lauren  our other executive officers  and certain other members of senior management 
we have entered into employment agreements with mr 
lauren and other executive officers  but competition for experienced executives in our industry is intense and the non compete period with respect to mr 
lauren and certain other executive officers could  in some circumstances in the event of their termination of employment with our company  end prior to the employment term set forth in their employment agreements 
we cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy 
as part of our growth strategy  we seek to extend our brands and merchandise categories  expand our geographic coverage  and increase direct management of our brands by opening more of our own stores  strategically acquiring or integrating select businesses previously held by our licensees  and enhancing our operations 
implementation of our strategy involves the continued expansion of our business in north america  asia  europe  latin america  and other international areas 
for example  as discussed in item business recent developments  in april  we completed the chaps men sportswear license acquisition  and we are in the process of repositioning and upgrading our existing distribution network in the asia pacific region 
we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our operations  hiring and retaining qualified key employees  or otherwise successfully managing such expansion 
furthermore  we may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any licensee that we acquire into our own business  incur additional costs  and or fail to achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration 
implementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation and expansion of our retail distribution network on a global basis  including our e commerce operations  which is subject to many factors beyond our control 
we may not be able to procure  purchase  or lease desirable freestanding or department store locations  renew  and maintain existing freestanding store leases and department store locations on acceptable terms  or secure suitable replacement locations 
the lease negotiation  as well as the number and timing of new stores and shop within shop locations actually opened during any given period and their associated contribution to net income for the period  depends on a number of factors including  but not limited to i the availability of suitable financing to us and our landlords  ii the timing of the delivery of the leased premises to us from our landlords in order to commence build out construction activities  iii our ability and our landlords ability to obtain all necessary governmental licenses and permits to construct and operate our stores on a timely basis  iv our ability to manage the construction and development costs of new stores  v the rectification of any unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with the leased premises  vi adverse weather conditions during the construction period  and vii the hiring and training of qualified operating personnel in the local market 
while we continue to explore new markets and are always evaluating new potential locations  any of the above factors could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
further  as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our e commerce business  sales from our brick and mortar stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where e commerce sites are introduced may decline due to cannibalization 
in europe  we lack the large wholesale distribution channels we have in the us  and we may have difficulty developing and maintaining successful distribution strategies and alliances in certain of the major european countries 
in asia  our primary mode of distribution is via a network of shops located within leading department stores 
as we have limited experience operating a direct to consumer business in this region and face established competitors  we may have difficulty in successfully retaining this network and expanding into alternate distribution channels 
in addition  certain of the international countries in which we operate  particularly in asia  have unique operational characteristics that vary from the us  including but not limited to employment and labor  transportation  logistics  acquiring store locations  and legal requirements  which may pose challenges to the execution and success of our related growth strategies 
further  macroeconomic trends may not be favorable and could limit our ability to implement our growth strategies in select geographies where we have foreign operations  such as europe  asia  and latin america 
achievement of our growth strategy requires investment in new capabilities  distribution channels  and technologies worldwide 
these investments may result in short term costs without accompanying current revenues and  therefore  may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term 
in addition  we may continue to incur costs in connection with repositioning our business in certain geographic areas  including in the asia pacific region 
although we believe that our strategy will lead to long term growth in revenue and profitability  the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized 
our ability to conduct business in international markets may be affected by legal  regulatory  political  and economic risks 
our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain our current level of operations in our existing international markets is subject to certain risks associated with operating in various international locations 
these include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  including trade and labor restrictions  compliance with us and other country laws relating to foreign operations  including the foreign corrupt practices act  which prohibits us companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business  and the uk bribery act  which prohibits uk and related companies from any form of bribery  unexpected changes in laws  judicial process  or regulatory requirements  and new tariffs or other barriers in certain international markets 
we are also subject to general political and economic risks in connection with our international operations  including political instability and terrorist attacks  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes  or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the us  the european union  asia  or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future  or what effect any of these actions would have  if any  on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
changes in regulatory  geopolitical  social  or economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future  or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices 
a data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers  expose us to litigation risk  and adversely affect our business 
we are dependent on information technology systems and networks  including the internet  for a significant portion of our direct to consumer sales  including our e commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing 
we are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our e commerce websites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy 
in our normal course of business  we often collect  retain  and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information  including credit card information  over public networks 
there is significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet  consumer identity theft  and user privacy 
despite the security measures we currently have in place  our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors  or other internet or email events 
any electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation  loss  or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information  including penetration of our network security  whether by us or by a third party  could disrupt our business  severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers  expose us to risks of litigation and liability  and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
since we do not control third party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break ins and security breaches will occur in the future  any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility  reduce our e commerce net sales  impair our ability to attract website visitors  and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers 
in addition  as the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy is becoming increasingly demanding  we may also incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state  federal  and foreign laws regarding protection of  and unauthorized disclosure of  personal information 
our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively 
we are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business  including in designing  marketing  manufacturing  importing  tracking  and distributing our products  processing payments  and accounting for  and reporting  results 
we also utilize an automated replenishment system to facilitate the processing of basic replenishment orders from our retail segment and our wholesale customers  the movement of goods through distribution channels  and the collection of information for planning and forecasting 
in addition  we have e commerce and other internet websites in north america  europe  and japan and have plans for additional e commerce sites in asia and other parts of the world 
given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on an annual basis  it is imperative that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware and software systems 
despite our preventative efforts  our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from  among other things  security breaches  computer viruses  or power outages 
any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
implementation of management information systems may negatively impact our business 
we are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software 
for example  we are in the process of implementing a new global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi year plan to integrate and upgrade our operational and financial systems and processes 
the implementation of this global system  scheduled to occur in phases over the next several years  began with the migration of certain of our domestic human resource systems during fiscal and continued with the transition of certain of our domestic operational and financial systems to the new global operating and financial reporting system during fiscal during fiscal  we continued to develop and enhance those operational and financial systems previously transitioned to the new global operating and financial reporting system 
the next phase of this implementation effort involves the migration of certain core areas of our business to the new system  including global merchandise procurement  and customer order management and record to report for our north american wholesale operations  beginning in fiscal we have an orderly plan to transition a number of our existing legacy systems to the new system over the next few years 
implementation of a new management information system involves risks and uncertainties 
any disruptions  delays  or deficiencies in the design or implementation of a new system  such as the new global operating and financial reporting system currently being implemented  could result in increased costs  disruptions in the sourcing and shipment of our product  and delays in the collection of cash from our customers  as well as have an adverse effect on our ability to timely report our financial results  all of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our ralph lauren brands and to continue to develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers 
our success depends on the value of our brands and our ability to consistently anticipate and respond to customers demands  preferences  and fashion trends in the design  pricing  and production of our products 
any failure on our part to anticipate  identify  and respond effectively to these consumer demands  preferences  and trends could adversely affect acceptance of our products 
the ralph lauren name is integral to our business and our business could be adversely affected if mr 
lauren public image or reputation were to be tarnished 
merchandise missteps or unfavorable publicity could negatively impact the image of our brands with our customers and could result in diminished loyalty to our brands  which could adversely impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business could be negatively impacted by any financial instability of our customers 
we sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores across north america  europe  asia  and latin america and extend credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer s financial condition  usually without requiring collateral 
however  the financial difficulties of a wholesale customer could cause us to limit or eliminate our business with that customer 
we may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer s receivables 
during fiscal  sales to our largest wholesale customer  macy  inc macy  accounted for approximately of total net revenues 
further  sales to our three largest wholesale customers  including macy  comprised approximately of all wholesale revenues and approximately of total net revenues for fiscal  and constituted approximately of our gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of march  our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see item business wholesale credit control 
uncertain economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers  suppliers  and lenders  which in turn could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world 
the current global political and economic environments have resulted in continued economic unpredictability in the us  europe  and asia 
in europe  there are continuing concerns regarding the increased debt levels of certain countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations  as well as the overall stability of the euro currency 
although we believe that our cash provided by operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will provide us with sufficient liquidity through the current global economic uncertainty  the impact of economic conditions on our major customers  suppliers  and lenders and their ability to access global capital markets cannot be predicted 
the inability of major manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers 
deterioration in global financial markets could affect our ability to access sources of liquidity to provide for our future cash needs  increase the cost of any future financing  or cause our lenders to be unable to meet their funding commitments under our credit facilities 
a disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and could suffer as a result of increases in the price of raw materials  freight  or labor or a manufacturer s inability to produce our goods on time and to our specifications 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products 
our products are manufactured to our specifications through arrangements with over foreign manufacturers in various countries 
in fiscal  over of our products by dollar value were produced outside the us  primarily in asia  europe  and latin america 
risks inherent in importing our products include changes in social  political  and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located  the imposition of additional regulations relating to imports or exports  the imposition of additional duties  taxes  and other charges on imports or exports  significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  increases in the cost of labor  fuel  travel  and transportation  disruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and man made disasters  significant delays in the delivery of cargo due to security considerations  the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duty proceedings resulting in the potential assessment of special anti dumping or countervailing duties  and the imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties either by the us or its trading partners to remedy perceived illegal actions by national governments 
any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our strict quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items  which could result in cancellation of orders  refusal to accept deliveries  or a substantial reduction in purchase prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
prices of raw materials used to manufacture our products may also fluctuate  and increases in prices of such raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales 
furthermore  the cost of labor at many of our third party manufacturers has been increasing significantly and  as the middle class in developing countries such as china continues to grow  it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate 
the cost of transportation has been increasing as well  and it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to rise and there is continued significant unrest in the middle east 
we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials  freight  or labor costs through pricing actions or other means 
our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins 
our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors  including intense competition  consolidation in the retail industry  pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products  and changes in consumer spending patterns 
these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers  which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs 
if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses  our profitability will decline 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  changes in our customer  channel  and geographic sales mix could have a negative impact on our profitability 
our business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations 
we generally purchase our products in us dollars 
however  we source most of our products overseas 
as a result  the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies 
changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products 
furthermore  our international sales are primarily derived from sales in foreign currencies  as is a portion of our licensing revenues  which could be materially affected by currency fluctuations 
these foreign currencies primarily include the euro  the japanese yen  the hong kong dollar  the south korean won  the canadian dollar  the swiss franc  and the british pound sterling 
our international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
although we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business  we cannot fully anticipate all of our currency exposures and therefore foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency markets  the accuracy of forecasted transactions  and the availability of hedging instruments 
as such  our hedging activities may not completely mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk management 
fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results 
we are subject to income taxes in many us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
we record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments  which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
in addition  the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing tax laws  which could materially affect our income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated 
in addition  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations 
we have significant undistributed earnings held by our subsidiaries outside the us most of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are held outside of the us and are considered to be permanently reinvested 
we currently intend to reinvest these funds in order to fund strategic initiatives  working capital requirements  and debt repayments both third party and intercompany of such foreign subsidiaries 
any future repatriation of such amounts to the us could result in a significant incremental tax liability in the period in which the decision to repatriate is made 
our company has an exclusive relationship with certain customers for some of our products 
the loss or significant decline in business of these customers could negatively impact our business 
we have exclusive relationships with certain customers for distribution of some of our products  including with kohl s for most of our chaps products 
our arrangement with companies such as kohl s makes us dependent on those companies financial and operational health for such products 
the loss of these relationships could have an adverse effect on our wholesale business 
our business could suffer as a result of consolidations  liquidations  restructurings  and other ownership changes in the retail industry 
several of our department store customers  including some under common ownership  account for a significant portion of our wholesale net sales 
a substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest department store customers 
during fiscal  sales to our largest wholesale customer  macy  accounted for approximately of total net revenues 
further  sales to our three largest wholesale customers  including macy  comprised approximately of all wholesale revenues and approximately of total net revenues for fiscal  and constituted approximately of our gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of march  there can be no assurance that consolidations  restructurings  reorganizations  or other ownership changes in the department store sector will not have a material adverse effect on our wholesale business 
we typically do not enter into long term agreements with our customers 
instead  we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season 
a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer  whether motivated by competitive conditions  financial difficulties  or otherwise  to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners or their new strategic and operational initiatives  including their continued focus on further development of their private label initiatives  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
certain legal proceedings  regulatory matters  and accounting changes could adversely impact our results of operations 
we are involved in certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of contract claims  intellectual property and other related claims  escheatment and unclaimed property  credit card fraud  security breaches in certain of our retail store information systems  employment issues  consumer matters  and other litigation 
certain of these lawsuits and claims  if decided adversely to us or settled by us  could result in material liability to our company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees  customers  licensees  or other third parties 
in addition  regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings  such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require our company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself 
further  changes in governmental regulations both in the us and in other countries where we conduct business operations  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion of our company s legal matters 
in addition  we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations 
the financial accounting standards board is currently in the process of amending a number of existing accounting standards governing a variety of areas 
certain of these proposed standards  particularly the proposed standard governing accounting for leases  if and when effective  would likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of proposed amendments to current accounting standards 
our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 
we have operations  including retail  distribution  and warehousing operations  in locations subject to natural disasters  such as severe weather and geological events  that could disrupt our operations 
in addition  our suppliers and customers also have operations in these locations and could experience similar disruptions 
the occurrence of natural events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local economies affected  as well as of the regional and global economies 
in addition  our business is affected by unseasonable weather conditions  such as extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures in the winter or unseasonably cold temperatures in the summer 
such natural events  including unseasonable weather conditions  could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the us we believe that our trademarks  intellectual property  and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti counterfeiting activities worldwide 
significant counterfeiting of our products continues  however  and in the course of our international expansion we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or claimed ownership rights to some trademarks that include polo and or a representation of a polo player astride a horse  or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks 
we have in the past resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements  none of which  we believe  has had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting or a material adverse effect on our business or brands arising from imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others 
also  there can be no assurance that others will not assert rights in  or ownership of  trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us and  as a result  our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to protect in such countries 
see item business trademarks  and item legal proceedings 
our business could suffer if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices 
we require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers  we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices 
the violation of labor  environmental  or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us or one of our licensing partners  or the divergence of an independent manufacturer s or licensing partner s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the us  could interrupt  or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation 
any of these events  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers or distribution centers 
we compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers 
some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have  and thus may have an advantage in securing production capacity 
if we experience a significant increase in demand  or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced  we may have to expand our third party manufacturing capacity 
we cannot guarantee that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us 
see item business sourcing  production and quality 
we enter into a number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery  method of payment  design and quality specifications  and other standard industry provisions  but do not have long term contracts with any manufacturer 
none of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively 
in addition  we rely on a number of owned and independently operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products to our customers and perform other related logistic services 
as such  our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on the proper operation of our distribution centers 
if any of our distribution centers were closed or were to become inoperable for any reason  we could experience a substantial loss of inventory  disruption of deliveries to our customers and our retail stores  increased costs  and longer lead times associated with the distribution of products during the period that would be required to reopen or replace the facility 
these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses 
the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing partner s business  including risks associated with a particular licensing partner s ability to obtain capital  manage its labor relations  maintain relationships with its suppliers  manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively  and maintain relationships with its customers 
although a number of our license agreements prohibit our licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our competitors  our licensing partners generally are not precluded from offering  under other non competitor brands  the types of products covered by their license agreements with us 
a substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest customers 
while we have significant control over our licensing partners products and advertising  we rely on our licensing partners for  among other things  operational and financial control over their businesses 
changes in management  reduced sales of licensed products  poor execution  or financial difficulties with respect to any of our licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues  both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 
see item business our licensing segment 
failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our business 
although we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners in most circumstances  if necessary  our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues  both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 
see item business our licensing segment 
the voting shares of our company s stock are concentrated in one majority stockholder 
as of march   mr 
ralph lauren  or entities controlled by the lauren family  owned approximately of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of our company 
mr 
lauren also serves as our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and we employ other members of the lauren family 
from time to time  and as approved or authorized by our board of directors  we may have other business dealings with mr 
lauren  members of the lauren family  or entities affiliated with mr 
lauren or the lauren family 
as a result of his stock ownership and position in our company  mr 
lauren has the ability to exercise significant control over our business  including  without limitation  i the election of our class b common stock directors  voting separately as a class  and ii any action requiring the approval of our stockholders  including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets 
the trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance 
our business planning process is designed to maximize our long term strength  growth  and profitability  and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter 
we believe that this longer term focus is in the best interests of our company and our stockholders 
at the same time  however  we recognize that  from time to time  it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings 
while we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter  we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward looking statements at such times or otherwise 
if  and when  we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us  outside analysts  or others  the market price of our securities could be adversely affected 
investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk 
we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities 
risks relating to the industry in which we compete the downturn in the global economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the industries in which we operate are cyclical 
many economic factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel  cosmetic  fragrance  accessory  jewelry  watch  and home product industries  including  among others general business conditions  economic downturns  employment levels  downturns in the stock market  interest rates  the housing market  consumer debt levels  the availability of consumer credit  increases in fuel prices  taxation  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products  including our products  tend to decline during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income is lower 
a downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in which we  or our licensing partners  sell our products may materially adversely affect our businesses  financial condition  and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations global economic developments for further discussion 
the domestic and international political situation also affects consumer confidence 
the threat  outbreak  or escalation of terrorism  military conflicts or other hostilities could lead to a decrease in consumer spending and may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate 
we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign fashion oriented apparel  footwear  accessory  and casual apparel producers  some of which may be significantly larger and more diversified and may have greater financial and marketing resources than us 
we compete with these companies primarily on the basis of anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner  creating and maintaining favorable brand recognition  loyalty  and a reputation for quality  developing and maintaining innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors  and styles that appeal to consumers  appropriately sourcing raw materials at cost effective prices  appropriately pricing products  anticipating and maintaining proper inventory levels  providing strong and effective marketing support  retaining and recruiting key employees  creating an acceptable value proposition for retail customers  ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain and distribution efficiencies with manufacturers and retailers  obtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail stores  maintaining and growing market share  and protecting our intellectual property 
we also face increasing competition from companies selling apparel  accessories  home  and other of our product categories through the internet 
although we sell our products through the internet  increased competition in the worldwide apparel  accessory  and home product industries from internet based competitors could reduce our sales  prices  and margins and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any increased competition  or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors  could result in reduced market share or sales  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing fashion and retail trends and consumer demands in a timely manner 
the industries in which we operate have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences 
our success depends in large part on our ability to originate and define fashion product and home product trends  as well as to anticipate  gauge  and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change  influenced by fashion trends  current economic conditions  and weather conditions  among other factors 
we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer demands in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers 
any failure on our part to anticipate  identify  and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities 
if that occurs  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess  slow moving inventory  which may harm our business and impair the image of our brands 
conversely  if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner  we may experience inventory shortages  which may result in unfilled orders  negatively impact customer relationships  diminish brand loyalty  and result in lost revenues 
any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations

wathne imports litigation on august   wathne imports  ltd 
wathne  our then domestic licensee for luggage and handbags  filed a complaint in the us district court in the southern district of new york against the company and mr 
ralph lauren  our chairman and chief executive officer  asserting  among other things  federal trademark law violations  breach of contract  breach of obligations of good faith and fair dealing  fraud and negligent misrepresentation 
the complaint originally sought  among other relief  injunctive relief  compensatory damages in excess of million and punitive damages of not less than million 
on september   wathne withdrew this complaint from the us district court and filed a complaint in the supreme court of the state of new york  new york county  making substantially the same allegations and claims excluding the federal trademark claims  and seeking similar relief 
on february   the court granted our motion to dismiss all of the causes of action  including the cause of action against mr 
lauren  except for breach of contract related claims  and denied wathne motion for a preliminary injunction 
following some discovery  we moved for summary judgment on the remaining claims and wathne cross moved for partial summary judgment 
in an april  decision and order  the court granted our summary judgment motion to dismiss most of the claims against our company  and denied wathne cross motion for summary judgment 
wathne appealed the dismissal of its claims to the appellate division of the supreme court 
following a hearing on may   the appellate division issued a decision and order on june  which  in large part  affirmed the lower court ruling 
we subsequently made a motion to exclude wathne proposed expert damages report and  on january   the court granted our motion 
wathne then appealed the ruling to the appellate division and  on october   the appellate division reversed the order of the lower court 
at this time  the trial date has not yet been scheduled and we intend to continue to contest the remaining claims and dispute any alleged damages in this lawsuit vigorously 
management does not expect that the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements
