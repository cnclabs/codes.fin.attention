executive summary the following executive summary is intended to provide significant highlights of the discussion and analysis that follows 
consolidated results of operations the changes in altria group  inc net earnings and diluted earnings per share eps attributable to altria group  inc for the year ended december   from the year ended december   were due primarily to the following in millions  except per share data net earnings diluted eps for the year ended december  asset impairment  exit  implementation and integration costs sabmiller special items pmcc leveraged lease charge tobacco and health judgments ust acquisition related costs tax items subtotal special items asset impairment  exit and implementation costs sabmiller special items pmcc leveraged lease benefit tobacco and health judgments loss on early extinguishment of debt tax items subtotal special items fewer shares outstanding change in tax rate operations for the year ended december  excludes the tax impact included in the pmcc leveraged lease benefit charge 
see the discussion of events affecting the comparability of statement of earnings amounts in the consolidated operating results section of the following discussion and analysis 

table of contents fewer shares outstanding fewer shares outstanding during compared with were due primarily to shares repurchased by altria group  inc under its share repurchase programs 
change in tax rate the change in tax rate includes a reduction in certain consolidated tax benefits resulting from the debt tender offer 
operations the increase of million in operations shown in the table above was due primarily to the following higher income from all reportable segments  higher equity earnings from sabmiller  and lower interest and other debt expense  net 
for further details  see the consolidated operating results and operating results by business segment sections of the following discussion and analysis 
forecasted results while there are signs of modest improvement in certain economic indicators  altria group  inc remains cautious about the business environment 
adult consumers remain under economic pressure as they face the end of the payroll tax holiday  as well as continuing high unemployment 
with a number of states facing budget shortfalls  tobacco products will remain a target for excise tax increases 
in january  altria group  inc forecasted that its full year reported diluted eps is expected to be in the range of to 
this forecast includes estimated expenses of per share as detailed in the table below  as compared with full year reported diluted eps of  which included per share of net expenses  as detailed in the table below 
expected full year adjusted diluted eps  which excludes the expenses in the table below  represents a growth rate of to over full year adjusted diluted eps 
the full year forecast does not reflect the potential impact of pm usa agreement to resolve the non participating manufacturer npm adjustment disputes  discussed in note contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item note 
the factors described in item a represent continuing risks to this forecast 
expense income  net included in reported diluted eps loss on early extinguishment of debt asset impairment  exit and implementation costs sabmiller special items pmcc leveraged lease benefit tax items excludes the tax impact included in the pmcc leveraged lease benefit 
adjusted diluted eps is a financial measure that is not consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
altria group  inc management reviews diluted eps on an adjusted basis  which excludes certain income and expense items that management believes are not part of underlying operations 
these items include loss on early extinguishment of debt  restructuring charges  sabmiller special items  certain pmcc leveraged lease items  certain tax items and tobacco and health judgments 
altria group  inc management does not view any of these special items to be part of its sustainable results as they may be highly variable and difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results 
altria group  inc management believes it is appropriate to disclose this non gaap financial measure to provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results  and to provide a more meaningful comparison of year over year results 
adjusted measures are used by management and regularly provided to altria group  inc chief operating decision maker for planning  forecasting and evaluating the performances of altria group  inc businesses  including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets 
this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with us gaap 
discussion and analysis critical accounting policies and estimates note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item note includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of altria group  inc consolidated financial statements 
in most instances  altria group  inc must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in altria group  inc consolidated results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between altria group  inc estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 
the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates  as well as the accounting policies and methods  used in the preparation of altria group  inc consolidated financial statements consolidation the consolidated financial statements include altria group  inc  as well as its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
investments in which altria 
table of contents group  inc exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
revenue recognition the consumer products businesses recognize revenues  net of sales incentives and sales returns  and including shipping and handling charges billed to customers  upon shipment or delivery of goods when title and risk of loss pass to customers 
payments received in advance of revenue recognition are deferred and recorded in other accrued liabilities until revenue is recognized 
altria group  inc consumer products businesses also include excise taxes billed to customers in net revenues 
shipping and handling costs are classified as part of cost of sales 
depreciation  amortization  impairment testing and asset valuation altria group  inc depreciates property  plant and equipment and amortizes its definite lived intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives up to years 
altria group  inc reviews long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
altria group  inc performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
these analyses are affected by general economic conditions and projected growth rates 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use  altria group  inc groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
impairment losses on assets to be disposed of  if any  are based on the estimated proceeds to be received  less costs of disposal 
altria group  inc also reviews the estimated remaining useful lives of long lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the lives may have changed 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets recorded by altria group  inc at december  relate primarily to the acquisitions of ust in and middleton in as required by us gaap  altria group  inc conducts an annual review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for potential impairment  and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would require altria group  inc to perform an interim review 
goodwill impairment testing requires a comparison between the carrying value and fair value of each reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  goodwill is considered impaired 
the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill  which is determined using discounted cash flows 
impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value of the intangible asset 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  by reporting unit at december  were as follows in millions goodwill indefinite lived intangible assets cigarettes smokeless products cigars wine total during  and  altria group  inc completed its annual review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and no impairment charges resulted from these reviews 
at december   the estimated fair values of the smokeless products and wine reporting units  as well as the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets within those reporting units  except for certain smokeless products trademarks primarily red seal and husky  substantially exceeded their carrying values 
at december   the estimated fair value of the cigars reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
in addition  the carrying value and excess fair value over carrying value for the indefinite lived intangible assets of certain smokeless products and cigars trademarks were as follows in millions carrying value excess fair value over carrying value certain smokeless products trademarks  primarily red seal and husky cigars trademarks  primarily black mild in the smokeless products reporting unit  results for certain smokeless products trademarks  primarily red seal and husky  continued to be impacted by lower levels of promotional support on these brands and increased competitive activity in the discount category due to growth in premium category products introduced in recent years at a lower  popular price 
this specific marketplace dynamic continued to negatively impact discounted cash flows when conducting the annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets 
in the cigars reporting unit  middleton continues to observe significant competitive activity  including higher levels of imported  low priced machine made large cigars 
as a result  management concluded after the review that while the fair values for certain smokeless products and cigars trademarks exceeded their respective carrying values as indicated above  they do not substantially exceed their carrying values 
in  altria group  inc utilized an income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units and its indefinite lived intangible assets 
the income approach reflects the 
table of contents discounting of expected future cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for the use of those funds  the expected rate of inflation and the risks associated with realizing expected future cash flows 
the average discount rate utilized in performing the valuations was 
in performing the discounted cash flow analysis  altria group  inc made various judgments  estimates and assumptions  the most significant of which were volume  income  growth rates and discount rates 
the analysis incorporated assumptions used in altria group  inc long term financial forecast and also included market participant assumptions regarding the highest and best use of altria group  inc indefinite lived intangible assets 
assumptions are also made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term financial forecast 
fair value calculations are sensitive to changes in these estimates and assumptions  some of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside of altria group  inc control 
although altria group  inc discounted cash flow analysis is based on assumptions that are considered reasonable and based on the best available information at the time that the discounted cash flow analysis is developed  there is significant judgment used in determining future cash flows 
the following factors have the most potential to impact expected future cash flows and  therefore  altria group  inc impairment conclusions general economic conditions  federal  state and local regulatory developments  changes in category growth rates as a result of changing consumer preferences  success of planned new product introductions  competitive activity  and tobacco related taxes 
while altria group  inc management believes that the estimated fair values of each reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset are reasonable  actual performance in the short term or long term could be significantly different from forecasted performance  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets  see note goodwill and other intangible assets  net to the consolidated financial statements in item marketing costs altria group  inc consumer products businesses promote their products with consumer engagement programs  consumer incentives and trade promotions 
such programs include  but are not limited to  discounts  coupons  rebates  in store display incentives  event marketing and volume based incentives 
consumer engagement programs are expensed as incurred 
consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period  based principally on historical utilization and redemption rates 
for interim reporting purposes  consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses are charged to operations as a percentage of sales  based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year 
contingencies as discussed in note and item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k item  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various united states and foreign jurisdictions against altria group  inc and its subsidiaries  including pm usa and ust and its subsidiaries  as well as their respective indemnitees 
in  pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers entered into the master settlement agreement the msa with states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims 
pm usa and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota together with the msa  the state settlement agreements 
pm usa portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on its relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments  including roll your own cigarettes  in the year preceding that in which the payment is due 
pm usa also entered into a trust agreement to provide certain aid to us tobacco growers and quota holders  but pm usa obligations under this trust expired on december  these obligations had been offset by the obligations imposed on pm usa by the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of fetra  which expires in the third quarter of 
usstc and middleton are also subject to obligations imposed by fetra 
in addition  in june  pm usa and a subsidiary of usstc became subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the united states food and drug administration fda as a result of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act fsptca 
the state settlement agreements  fetra and the fda user fees call for payments that are based on variable factors  such as volume  market share and inflation  depending on the subject payment 
altria group  inc subsidiaries account for the cost of the state settlement agreements  fetra and fda user fees as a component of cost of sales 
as a result of the state settlement agreements  fetra and fda user fees  altria group  inc subsidiaries recorded approximately billion  billion and billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note for a discussion of the potential impact of pm usa agreement to resolve the npm adjustment disputes 
altria group  inc and its subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when they determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
except to the extent discussed in note and item  at the present time  while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur  i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco related cases  ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any of the pending tobacco related cases  and iii accordingly  management has not provided any 
table of contents amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
litigation defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in marketing  administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings 
employee benefit plans as discussed in note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements in item note  altria group  inc provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees  including pensions  postretirement health care and postemployment benefits primarily severance 
altria group  inc records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions  such as discount rates  assumed rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
altria group  inc reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods 
altria group  inc recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet and records as a component of other comprehensive earnings losses  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
at december   altria group  inc discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans decreased to and  respectively  from and  respectively  at december  altria group  inc presently anticipates a decrease of approximately million in its pre tax pension and postretirement expense  not including amounts in each year related to termination  settlement and curtailment 
this anticipated decrease is due primarily to higher expected return on pension plan assets due to the higher value of plan assets at december  and the impact of a million voluntary pension plan contribution made in january  partially offset by the impact of the discount rate changes 
a basis point decrease increase in altria group  inc discount rates would increase decrease altria group  inc pension and postretirement expense by approximately million 
similarly  a basis point decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease altria group  inc pension expense by approximately million 
see note for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates 
income taxes altria group  inc deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
altria group  inc recognizes a benefit for uncertain tax positions when a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
altria group  inc recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on its consolidated statements of earnings 
as discussed in note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements in item note  altria group  inc recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during  and as a result of various tax events 
leasing substantially all of pmcc net revenues in related to income on leveraged leases and related gains on asset sales 
income relating to leveraged leases is recorded initially as unearned income  which is included in the line item finance assets  net  on altria group  inc consolidated balance sheets  and is subsequently recognized as revenue over the terms of the respective leases at constant after tax rates of return on the positive net investment balances 
as discussed in note finance assets  net to the consolidated financial statements in item note  pmcc lessees are affected by bankruptcy filings  credit rating changes and financial market conditions 
pmcc investment in leases is included in the line item finance assets  net  on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and at december   pmcc net finance receivables of approximately billion in leveraged leases  which are included in finance assets  net  on altria group  inc consolidated balance sheet  consisted of rents receivable billion and the residual value of assets under lease billion  reduced by third party nonrecourse debt billion and unearned income billion 
the repayment of the nonrecourse debt is collateralized by lease payments receivable and the leased property  and is nonrecourse to the general assets of pmcc 
as required by us gaap  the third party nonrecourse debt has been offset against the related rents receivable and has been presented on a net basis within finance assets  net  on altria group  inc consolidated balance sheets 
finance assets  net  at december   also included net finance receivables for direct finance leases billion and an allowance for losses billion 
estimated residual values represent pmcc estimate at lease inception as to the fair values of assets under lease at the end of the non cancelable lease terms 
the estimated residual values are reviewed annually by pmcc management  which includes analysis of a number of factors  including activity in the relevant industry 
if necessary  revisions are recorded to reduce the residual values 
such reviews resulted in a decrease of million in and million in to pmcc s net revenues and results of operations 
there were no adjustments in pmcc considers rents receivable past due when they are beyond the grace period of their contractual due date 
pmcc 
table of contents stops recording income non accrual status on rents receivable when contractual payments become days past due or earlier if management believes there is significant uncertainty of collectability of rent payments  and resumes recording income when collectability of rent payments is reasonably certain 
payments received on rents receivable that are on non accrual status are used to reduce the rents receivable balance 
write offs to the allowance for losses are recorded when amounts are deemed to be uncollectible 
there were no rents receivable on non accrual status at december  to the extent that rents receivable due to pmcc may be uncollectible  pmcc records an allowance for losses against its finance assets 
losses on such leases are recorded when probable and estimable 
pmcc regularly performs a systematic assessment of each individual lease in its portfolio to determine potential credit or collection issues that might indicate impairment 
impairment takes into consideration both the probability of default and the likelihood of recovery if default were to occur 
pmcc considers both quantitative and qualitative factors of each investment when performing its assessment of the allowance for losses

these challenges  some of which are discussed in more detail below  and in note  item a and item  include pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements as discussed in note and item  restrictions and requirements imposed by the fsptca enacted in june  and restrictions and requirements that have been  and in the future may be  imposed by the fda under this statute  actual and proposed excise tax increases  as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements  bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers  other federal  state and local government actions  including restrictions on the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments  the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes  additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products  other actual and proposed tobacco product legislation and regulation  and governmental investigations  the diminishing prevalence of cigarette smoking and increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and others including employers to further restrict tobacco use  price gaps and changes in price gaps between premium and lowest price brands  competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation  illicit trade practices  including the sale of counterfeit tobacco products by third parties  the sale of tobacco products by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid the collection of applicable taxes  diversion into one market of products intended for sale in another  the potential assertion of claims and other issues relating to contraband shipments of tobacco products  and the 
table of contents imposition of additional legislative or regulatory requirements related to illicit trade practices  and potential adverse changes in tobacco leaf price  availability and quality 
in addition to and in connection with the foregoing business and legal challenges  our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences 
altria group  inc tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories or use multiple forms of tobacco products and that approximately of adult smokers are interested in spit free smokeless tobacco alternatives to cigarettes 
future success is dependent in part on the ability of altria group  inc and its tobacco subsidiaries to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences by developing over time new products and markets within and potentially outside the united states through technological innovation including  where appropriate  arrangements with third parties and pursuit of their adjacency growth strategies 
see item a for certain risks associated with the foregoing discussion 
we have provided additional detail on the following topics below fsptca and fda regulation  excise taxes  international treaty on tobacco control  state settlement agreements  other federal  state and local regulation and activity  illicit trade  tobacco price  availability and quality  and timing of sales 
fsptca and fda regulation the regulatory framework the fsptca expressly establishes certain restrictions and prohibitions on our cigarette and smokeless tobacco businesses and authorizes or requires further fda action 
under the fsptca  the fda has broad authority to regulate the design  manufacture  packaging  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of cigarettes  cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products  the authority to require disclosures of related information  and the authority to enforce the fsptca and related regulations 
the law also grants the fda authority to extend its application  by regulation  to other tobacco products  including cigars 
the fda has indicated that it intends to regulate cigars and other tobacco products  but it has not indicated a timeline for the issuance of regulations 
among other measures  the fsptca imposes restrictions on the advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of tobacco products  including at retail  prohibits cigarettes with characterizing flavors other than menthol and tobacco  bans descriptors such as light  mild or low or similar descriptors unless expressly authorized by the fda  requires extensive ingredient disclosure to the fda and may require more limited public ingredient disclosure  prohibits any express or implied claims that a tobacco product is or may be less harmful than other tobacco products without fda authorization  imposes reporting obligations relating to contraband activity and grants the fda authority to impose other recordkeeping and reporting obligations to address counterfeit and contraband products  changes the language of the cigarette and smokeless tobacco product health warnings  enlarges their size and requires the development by the fda of graphic warnings for cigarettes  which it published in june  and gives the fda the authority to require new warnings  authorizes the fda to adopt product regulations and related actions  including to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health through a regulatory process  including  among other possibilities  restrictions on ingredients  constituents or other properties  performance or design criteria  as well as to impose testing  measurement  reporting and disclosure requirements  to subject tobacco products that are modified or first introduced into the market after march  to application and premarket review and authorization requirements the new product application process if the fda does not find them to be substantially equivalent to products commercially marketed as of february   and to deny any such new product application thus preventing the distribution and sale of any product affected by such denial  to determine that certain existing tobacco products modified or introduced into the market for the first time between february  and march  are not substantially equivalent to products commercially marketed as of february   in which case the fda could require the removal of such products or subject them to the new product application process and  if any such applications are denied  prevent the continued distribution and sale of such products see fda regulatory actions below  to restrict or otherwise regulate menthol cigarettes  as well as other tobacco products with characterizing flavors  to regulate nicotine yields and to reduce or eliminate harmful constituents or harmful ingredients or other components of tobacco products  and to impose manufacturing standards for tobacco products  and 
table of contents equips the fda with a variety of investigatory and enforcement tools  including the authority to inspect tobacco product manufacturing and other facilities 
implementation timing  rulemaking and guidance the implementation of the fsptca began in and will continue over time 
some provisions took effect immediately  some provisions have taken effect since the enactment of the fsptca and other provisions will not take effect for some time 
those provisions that require the fda to take action through rulemaking generally involve consideration of public comment and  for some issues  scientific review 
altria group  inc tobacco subsidiaries are participating actively in processes established by the fda to develop and implement its regulatory framework  including submission of comments to various fda proposals and participation in public hearings and engagement sessions 
from time to time  the fda also issues guidance for public comment  which may be issued in draft or final form 
such guidance  when finalized  is intended to represent the fda current thinking on a particular topic and may be predictive of the fda enforcement stance on that topic 
such guidance  even when finalized  is not intended to bind the fda or the public or establish legally enforceable responsibilities 
examples of current draft guidance include draft guidance for industry and fda staff demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions draft guidance for industry modified risk tobacco product applications draft guidance for industry applications for premarket review of new tobacco products a complete set of guidance documents issued by the fda can be found on the fda website at www 
fda 
gov tobaccoproductsguidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation 
the information on this website is not  and shall not be deemed to be  part of this report or incorporated into any other filings altria group  inc makes with the securities and exchange commission sec 
pm usa and usstc submit comments to the fda on draft or final guidance when appropriate 
in some cases  pm usa and usstc may disagree with a particular interpretation by the fda as expressed in draft or final guidance and may communicate their position in writing to the fda 
for example  pm usa and usstc communicated disagreement with fda interpretations of the statute set forth in the draft guidance for industry and fda staff demonstrating the substantial equivalence of a new tobacco product responses to frequently asked questions regarding when a manufacturer must submit substantial equivalence reports 
while pm usa and usstc believe that all of their current products meet the statutory requirements of the fsptca  they cannot predict whether  when or how the fda ultimately will apply its guidance or seek to enforce the law and regulations consistent with its guidance 
as discussed below in investigations and enforcement  fda enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial position  cash flows and results of operations of altria group  inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 
the implementation of the fsptca and related regulations and guidance also may have an impact on enforcement efforts by states  territories and localities of the united states of their laws and regulations as well as of the state settlement agreements discussed below see state settlement agreements below 
such enforcement efforts may adversely affect our tobacco subsidiaries ability to market and sell regulated tobacco products in those states  territories and localities 
impact on our business  compliance costs regulations imposed by the fda under the fsptca could have a material adverse impact on the business and sales volume of altria group  inc tobacco businesses in a number of different ways 
for example  actions by the fda could impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco products  delay or prevent the sale or distribution of existing  new or modified tobacco products  limit adult consumer choices  restrict communications to adult consumers  create a competitive advantage or disadvantage for certain tobacco companies  impose additional manufacturing  labeling or packaging requirements  impose restrictions at retail  result in increased illicit trade activities  or otherwise significantly increase the cost of doing business 
the failure to comply with fda regulatory requirements  even inadvertently  and fda enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial position  cash flows and results of operations of altria group  inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 
the law imposes fees on tobacco product manufacturers and importers to pay for the cost of regulation and other matters 
the cost of the fda user fee is allocated first among tobacco product categories subject to fda regulation according to a process set out in the statute  and then among manufacturers and importers within each respective class based on their relative market shares 
for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements  fetra and fda user fee payments on altria group  inc  see off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements  and fda regulation below 
in addition  compliance with the law regulatory requirements has resulted and will continue to result in additional costs for our tobacco businesses 
the amount of additional compliance and related costs has not been material in any given quarter to date but could become substantial  either individually or in the aggregate  and will depend on the nature of the requirements imposed by the fda 

table of contents investigation and enforcement the fda has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it  including document requests and other required information submissions  facility inspections  examinations and investigations  injunction proceedings  money penalties  product withdrawals and recalls  and product seizures 
the use of any of these investigatory or enforcement tools by the fda could result in significant costs to the tobacco businesses of altria group  inc or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the business  financial position  cash flows and results of operations of altria group  inc and its tobacco subsidiaries 
for example  in june  the fda issued a document request regarding changes to marlboro gold pack cigarette packaging in connection with the fsptca ban of certain descriptors 
pm usa submitted documents in response to the fda request 
tpsac the role of the tpsac as required by the fsptca  the fda has established a tobacco product scientific advisory committee the tpsac  which consists of both voting and non voting members  to provide advice  reports  information and recommendations to the fda on scientific and health issues relating to tobacco products 
for example  the tpsac advises the fda about modified risk products products marketed with reduced risk claims  good manufacturing practices  the effects of the alteration of nicotine yields from tobacco products and nicotine dependence thresholds 
the tpsac previously made reports and recommendations to the fda on menthol cigarettes  including the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health  and the nature and impact of dissolvable tobacco products on the public health 
the fda may seek advice from the tpsac about other safety  dependence or health issues relating to tobacco products  including tobacco product standards and applications to market new tobacco products 
tpsac membership beginning in march  pm usa and usstc raised with the fda their concerns that four of the voting members of the tpsac have financial and other conflicts including services as paid experts for plaintiffs in tobacco litigation that could hamper the full and fair consideration of issues by the tpsac and requested that their appointments be withdrawn 
the fda declined pm usa and usstc requests  stating that the fda had satisfied itself  after inquiry  that the tpsac members did not have disqualifying conflicts of interest 
the fda stated further that it would continue to screen  in accordance with relevant statutory and regulatory provisions and fda guidance  all tpsac members for potential conflicts of interest for matters that the tpsac would be considering 
the fda also engaged two individuals to serve as consultants to a tpsac subcommittee who also served as paid experts for plaintiffs in tobacco litigation 
pm usa and usstc raised similar concerns related to the engagement of these individuals and the fda similarly declined to terminate these engagements 
in february  lorillard tobacco company and rj reynolds tobacco company filed suit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the united states department of health and human services and individual defendants sued in their official capacities asserting that the composition of the tpsac and the composition of the constituents subcommittee of the tpsac violates several federal laws  including the federal advisory committee act 
in august  the district court denied the government motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint 
tpsac action on menthol as mandated by the fsptca  in march  the tpsac submitted to the fda a report on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health and related recommendations 
the tpsac report stated that menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health in the united states 
the tpsac report recommended that the removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the united states 
the tpsac report noted the potential that any ban on menthol cigarettes could lead to an increase in contraband cigarettes and other potential unintended consequences and suggested that the fda consult with appropriate experts on this matter 
the tpsac report also recommended that additional research could address gaps in understanding menthol cigarettes 
in march  pm usa submitted a report to the fda outlining its position that neither science nor other evidence demonstrates that regulatory actions or restrictions related to the use of menthol cigarettes are warranted 
the report noted pm usa belief that significant restrictions on the use of menthol cigarettes would have unintended consequences detrimental to public health and society 
in july  the tpsac revised and approved its march report 
the revisions were editorial in nature and did not change the substantive conclusions and recommendations of the tpsac 
the fsptca does not set a deadline or required timeline for the fda to act on the tpsac report 
the fda has stated that the tpsac report is only a recommendation and that the fda receipt of the tpsac report will not have an immediate effect on the availability of menthol cigarettes 
in january  the fda announced that it had evaluated scientific information on menthol and had drafted a report related to the impact of menthol in cigarettes on public health 
the fda indicated that it had sent its report to external scientists for peer review 
it also indicated that it will make its final draft report and related information available for public comment  although it has not yet done so 
any future action taken by the fda to regulate the manufacture  marketing or sale of menthol cigarettes including a possible ban will require formal rulemaking that includes public notice and the opportunity for public comment 

table of contents final tobacco marketing rule as required by the fsptca  the fda re promulgated in march certain advertising and promotion restrictions in substantially the same form as regulations that were previously adopted in but never imposed on tobacco manufacturers due to a united states supreme court ruling the final tobacco marketing rule 
the final tobacco marketing rule bans the use of color and graphics in tobacco product labeling and advertising  prohibits the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to underage persons  restricts the use of non tobacco trade and brand names on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products  requires the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in direct  face to face transactions  prohibits sampling of cigarettes and prohibits sampling of smokeless tobacco products except in qualified adult only facilities  prohibits gifts or other items in exchange for buying cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products  prohibits the sale or distribution of items such as hats and tee shirts with tobacco brands or logos  and prohibits brand name sponsorship of any athletic  musical  artistic  or other social or cultural event  or any entry or team in any event 
subject to the limitations described below  the final tobacco marketing rule took effect in june at the time of the re promulgation of the final tobacco marketing rule  the fda also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the so called foot rule  which would establish restrictions on the placement of outdoor tobacco advertising in relation to schools and playgrounds 
pm usa and usstc submitted comments on this advance notice 
since enactment  several lawsuits have been filed challenging various provisions of the fsptca and the final tobacco marketing rule  including their constitutionality and the scope of the fda authority thereunder 
altria group  inc and its tobacco subsidiaries are not parties to any of these lawsuits 
in january  in one such challenge commonwealth brands  the united states district court for the western district of kentucky struck down as unconstitutional  and enjoined enforcement of  the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising and claims implying that a tobacco product is safer because of fda regulation 
the parties appealed and in march  the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court decision 
the sixth circuit affirmed the district court injunction against enforcement of the portion of the final tobacco marketing rule that bans the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising 
the sixth circuit reversed the injunction against enforcement of the prohibition on claims implying that a tobacco product is safer because of fda regulation 
the sixth circuit also held that the final tobacco marketing rule ban on consumer continuity programs violates the first amendment and reversed the district court decision upholding the ban 
the sixth circuit upheld the fsptca statutory requirements for enlarged textual and graphic warnings on cigarette packages and advertising  but did not rule upon the constitutionality of the nine graphic warnings actually selected by the fda in its june final rule 
in may  the plaintiffs in commonwealth brands filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc  which the sixth circuit denied 
in october  the plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court seeking further review of the sixth circuit decision upholding the fsptca new enlarged and expanded warning requirements that include graphic warnings  the fsptca restrictions on modified risk tobacco product claims and certain other provisions of the final tobacco marketing rule 
the fda did not file a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court seeking further review of the sixth circuit decision 
for a further discussion of this final rule and the challenge pending in the united states district court for the district of columbia  see fda regulatory actions graphics warnings below 
the fda has indicated that it does not intend to enforce the ban on the use of color and graphics in labeling and advertising for the duration of the injunction 
in a separate challenge to the final tobacco marketing rule in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia  renegade tobacco company  inc and others have challenged the constitutionality of an fda regulation that restricts tobacco manufacturers from using the trade or brand name of a non tobacco product on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products 
in may  the court issued a stay in the renegade case pending the fda consideration of amendments to the trade or brand name rule 
in november  the fda proposed an amended rule  but continues to exercise its discretion to enforce the original trade or brand name provisions of the final tobacco marketing rule according to fda guidance issued in may it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such litigation or its effect on the extent of the fda authority to regulate tobacco products 
contraband the fsptca imposes on manufacturers reporting obligations relating to knowledge of suspected contraband activity involving their brands and also grants the fda the authority to impose certain other recordkeeping and reporting obligations to address counterfeit and contraband tobacco products 
the fsptca also empowers the fda to assess whether additional tools should be employed to track and trace tobacco products through the distribution chain 
fda regulatory actions graphic warnings in june  as required by the fsptca  the fda issued its final rule to modify the required warnings that appear on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements 
the fsptca requires the warnings to 
table of contents consist of nine new textual warning statements accompanied by color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking 
the graphic health warnings will i be located beneath the cellophane  and comprise the top percent of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages  and ii occupy percent of a cigarette advertisement and be located at the top of the advertisement 
the rule requires that cigarette packaging manufactured after september  contain the new graphic warnings and all cigarette advertising contain the new warnings by that date 
in august  however  rj reynolds tobacco company  lorillard tobacco company and several other plaintiffs filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against the fda challenging its graphic warnings rule 
in november  the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction  thereby staying enforcement of the graphic warnings rule until months after a final ruling from the district court 
in february  the district court entered final judgment on behalf of the plaintiffs  enjoining enforcement of the graphic warnings rule 
the fda appealed this decision to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
in august  the court of appeals affirmed the ruling of the district court 
the fda filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc with the court of appeals  which was denied on december  pm usa is not a party to this lawsuit  but the fda has confirmed that it will not enforce the graphic warnings rule against pm usa on the same terms and with the same effect as the district court injunction discussed above 
new product marketing authorization processes in january  the fda issued guidance concerning reports that manufacturers must submit for certain fda regulated tobacco products that the manufacturer modified or introduced for the first time into the market after february  these reports must be reviewed by the agency to determine if such tobacco products are substantially equivalent to products commercially available as of february  in general  in order to continue marketing these products sold before march   manufacturers of fda regulated tobacco products were required to send to the fda a report demonstrating substantial equivalence by march  pm usa and usstc submitted timely reports 
pm usa and usstc can continue marketing these products unless the fda makes a determination that a specific product is not substantially equivalent 
if the fda ultimately makes such a determination  it could require the removal of such products or subject them to the new product application process and  if any such applications are denied  prevent the continued distribution and sale of such products 
pm usa and usstc believe all of their current products meet the statute requirements  but cannot predict when or how the fda will respond to their reports 
manufacturers intending to introduce new products and certain modified products into the market after march  must submit a report to the fda and obtain a substantial equivalence order from the agency before introducing the products into the market 
if the fda declines to issue a so called substantial equivalence order for a product or if the manufacturer itself determines that the product does not meet the substantial equivalence requirements  the product would need to undergo the new product application process 
at this time  it is not possible to predict how long agency reviews of either substantial equivalence reports or new product applications will take 
the fda also published a final regulation in july  establishing a process for requesting an exemption from the substantial equivalence requirements for certain minor modifications to tobacco additives 
the final rule became effective in august excise taxes tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states 
significant increases in tobacco related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal  state and local levels within the united states 
federal  state and local excise taxes have increased substantially over the past decade  far outpacing the rate of inflation 
for example  in  the federal excise tax fet on cigarettes increased from cents per pack to approximately per pack and on july   the new york state excise tax increased by to per pack 
between the end of and february   the weighted average state and certain local cigarette excise taxes increased from to per pack 
during  two states illinois and rhode island enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise tax 
as of february   no state has increased its cigarette excise tax in tax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of tobacco products by our tobacco subsidiaries  due to lower consumption levels and to a potential shift in adult consumer purchases from the premium to the non premium or discount segments or to other low priced or low taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products 
such shifts may have an impact on the reported share performance of tobacco products of altria group  inc tobacco subsidiaries 
a majority of states currently tax smokeless tobacco products using an ad valorem method  which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product  typically the wholesale price 
this ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower priced products of equal weight 
altria group  inc subsidiaries support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on smokeless tobacco to a weight based methodology because  unlike the ad valorem tax  a weight based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax 
as of february   states  washington  dc  philadelphia  pennsylvania and cook county  illinois have adopted a weight based tax methodology for smokeless tobacco 

table of contents international treaty on tobacco control the world health organization framework convention on tobacco control the fctc entered into force in february as of february   countries  as well as the european community  have become parties to the fctc 
while the united states is a signatory of the fctc  it is not currently a party to the agreement  as the agreement has not been submitted to  or ratified by  the united states senate 
the fctc is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation 
the treaty recommends and in certain instances  requires signatory nations to enact legislation that would  among other things establish specific actions to prevent youth tobacco product use  restrict or eliminate all tobacco product advertising  marketing  promotion and sponsorship  initiate public education campaigns to inform the public about the health consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke and the benefits of quitting  implement regulations imposing product testing  disclosure and performance standards  impose health warning requirements on packaging  and adopt measures intended to combat tobacco product smuggling and counterfeit tobacco products  including tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and restrict smoking in public places 
there are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the fctc  some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture  marketing  distribution and sale of tobacco products 
in addition  the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products the protocol was approved by the conference of parties to the fctc on november  it includes provisions related to the tracking and tracing of tobacco products through the distribution chain and numerous other provisions regarding the regulation of the manufacture  distribution  and sale of tobacco products 
the protocol has not yet entered into force  but in any event will not apply to the united states until the senate ratifies the fctc 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any fctc actions on legislation or regulation in the united states  either directly as a result of the united states becoming a party to the fctc  or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence fda regulation and enforcement 
state settlement agreements as discussed in note  during and  pm usa and other major domestic tobacco product manufacturers entered into agreements with states and various united states jurisdictions settling asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims collectively  the state settlement agreements 
these settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments  which are adjusted for several factors  including inflation  market share and industry volume 
for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements  fetra and fda user fee payments on altria group  inc  see off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements  and fda regulation below 
the settlements also place numerous requirements and restrictions on participating manufacturers business operations  including prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products 
among these are prohibitions of outdoor and transit brand advertising  payments for product placement and free sampling except in adult only facilities 
restrictions are also placed on the use of brand name sponsorships and brand name non tobacco products 
the state settlement agreements also place prohibitions on targeting youth and the use of cartoon characters 
in addition  the state settlement agreements require companies to affirm corporate principles directed at reducing underage use of cigarettes  impose requirements regarding lobbying activities  mandate public disclosure of certain industry documents  limit the industry ability to challenge certain tobacco control and underage use laws  and provide for the dissolution of certain tobacco related organizations and place restrictions on the establishment of any replacement organizations 
in november  usstc entered into the smokeless tobacco master settlement agreement the stmsa with the attorneys general of various states and united states territories to resolve the remaining health care cost reimbursement cases initiated against usstc 
the stmsa required usstc to adopt various marketing and advertising restrictions 
usstc is the only smokeless tobacco manufacturer to sign the stmsa 
other federal  state and local regulation and activity federal  state and local laws state and local laws addressing certain characterizing flavors in a growing number of states and localities  legislation has been enacted or proposed that prohibits or would prohibit the sale of certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors 
the legislation varies in terms of the type of tobacco products subject to prohibition  the conditions under which the sale of such products is or would be prohibited  and exceptions to the prohibitions 
for example  a number of proposals would prohibit characterizing flavors in smokeless tobacco products  with no exception for mint or wintergreen flavored products 
to date  the following states have enacted legislation that prohibits certain tobacco products with certain characterizing flavors maine enacted legislation that prohibits the sale of certain flavored cigar and cigarette products 
as implemented  including the application of certain statutory exemptions  this prohibition did not ban any pm usa  usstc or middleton product 
in  maine amended the characterizing flavor prohibition 
the amendment allows the continued sale of cigars that obtained favorable exemption rulings under the previous statute but does not provide for the possibility of further exemptions  such as for future products with characterizing flavors 

table of contents new jersey enacted legislation banning the sale and marketing of cigarettes with a characterizing flavor other than menthol  mint or clove 
this legislation does not ban any pm usa  usstc or middleton product 
in addition  such legislation has been enacted or is being considered in a number of localities 
for example new york city adopted an ordinance that prohibits the sale of certain flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes 
this legislation affects certain usstc and middleton products 
the ordinance and related final regulations took effect in august certain subsidiaries of usstc have filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york challenging the new york city legislation on the grounds that it is preempted by the fsptca 
in march  the district court denied plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction against enforcement of the ordinance and  in november  the district court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment  and granted new york city cross motion for summary judgment  on the preemption claim 
plaintiffs have appealed the denial to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit and  in the meantime  are complying with the ordinance pending resolution of the litigation 
argument was heard on november  on february   the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court upholding the new york city ordinance 
providence  rhode island adopted two ordinances in january one would prohibit the sale in most retail outlets of certain flavored tobacco products other than cigarettes 
this legislation differs in a number of ways from the new york city ordinance  including by attempting to prohibit reference to concepts such as spicy  arctic  ice  cool  warm  hot  mellow  fresh and breeze 
the second providence ordinance prohibits licensed retailers in the city from accepting or redeeming coupons for cigarettes and other tobacco products or from selling such products to consumers through multi pack discounts or other discounts provided in exchange for the purchase of another tobacco product 
in february  altria group  inc tobacco subsidiaries filed a legal challenge to these ordinances in the united states district court for the district of rhode island challenging the legality of both ordinances on preemption and first amendment grounds 
plaintiffs filed motions for preliminary injunction and summary judgment in march the city of providence filed a cross motion for summary judgment in june on december   the district court struck the concepts language quoted above from the flavor ordinance  but otherwise granted summary judgment for the city of providence as to both ordinances 
the city of providence commenced enforcement of the ordinances  as modified by the district court  on january  on january   plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the first circuit 
whether other states or localities will enact legislation in this area  and the precise nature of such legislation if enacted  cannot be predicted 
see fda regulation above for a summary of the fsptca regulation of certain tobacco products with characterizing flavors 
state and local laws imposing certain speech requirements and restrictions in several jurisdictions  legislation or regulations have been enacted or proposed that would require the disclosure of health information separate from or in addition to federally mandated health warnings or that would restrict commercial speech in certain respects 
for example  in july  the united states court of appeals for the second circuit determined that an effort by new york city to require retailers selling tobacco products to display a sign  issued by the new york city board of health  depicting graphic images of the potential health consequences of smoking and urging smokers to quit was preempted by federal law 
this litigation has concluded 
as another example  the village board of haverstraw  new york enacted a tobacco product display ban in april it would have barred tobacco retailers from displaying any tobacco product in a manner that a consumer could view the product prior to purchase 
retailers could maintain a tobacco menu  listing the types and prices of tobacco products available for sale  but the menu could only be given to a consumer  over the legal age to purchase tobacco products  who requested it 
at all other times  any tobacco menu would have been concealed from view 
in june  an association of tobacco retailers  along with several tobacco product manufacturers and distributors including pm usa  a subsidiary of usstc and middleton  filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york challenging the display ban on first amendment and preemption grounds 
in july  the village board voted to approve a settlement of the lawsuit and  in august  voted to repeal the ordinance 
this litigation has concluded 
federal tobacco quota buy out in october  fetra was signed into law 
pm usa  middleton and usstc are subject to the requirements of fetra 
fetra eliminated the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buy out of tobacco growers and quota holders 
the cost of the buy out is approximately billion and is being paid over years ending in by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product 
the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product 
in february  pm usa filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia challenging the united states department of agriculture the usda method for calculating the and future tobacco product class shares that are used to allocate liability for the industry payments that fund the fetra buy out described above and are used by the fda to calculate the 
table of contents industry fda user fees 
pm usa asserted in this litigation that the usda violated fetra  and imposed excessive fetra assessments on pm usa  by failing to apply the most current fet rates enacted by congress  which became effective in april  in calculating the class share allocations 
the cigar association of america has joined the litigation as a defendant intervenor 
in october  the district court denied pm usa motion for summary judgment  granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case 
on december   pm usa filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit 
for a discussion of the impact of the state settlement agreements  fetra and fda user fee payments on altria group  inc  see off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations payments under state settlement and other tobacco agreements  and fda regulation below 
we do not anticipate that the quota buy out will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results in and health effects of tobacco consumption and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ets it is the policy of altria group  inc and its tobacco subsidiaries to defer to the judgment of public health authorities as to the content of warnings in advertisements and on product packaging regarding the health effects of tobacco consumption  addiction and exposure to ets 
altria group  inc and its tobacco subsidiaries believe that the public should be guided by the messages of the united states surgeon general and public health authorities worldwide in making decisions concerning the use of tobacco products 
reports with respect to the health effects of smoking have been publicized for many years  including in a june united states surgeon general report on ets entitled the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke 
many jurisdictions within the united states have restricted smoking in public places 
the pace and scope of public smoking bans have increased significantly 
some public health groups have called for  and various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed  bans on smoking in outdoor places  in private apartments and in cars with minors in them 
it is not possible to predict the results of ongoing scientific research or the types of future scientific research into the health risks of tobacco exposure and the impact of such research on regulation 
other legislation or governmental initiatives in addition to the actions discussed above  other regulatory initiatives affecting the tobacco industry have been adopted or are being considered at the federal level and in a number of state and local jurisdictions 
for example  in recent years  legislation has been introduced or enacted at the state or local level to subject tobacco products to various reporting requirements and performance standards such as reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards  establish educational campaigns relating to tobacco consumption or tobacco control programs  or provide additional funding for governmental tobacco control activities  restrict the sale of tobacco products in certain retail establishments and the sale of tobacco products in certain packing sizes  require tax stamping of moist smokeless tobacco products  require the use of state tax stamps using data encryption technology  and further restrict the sale  marketing and advertising of cigarettes and other tobacco products 
such legislation may be subject to constitutional or other challenges on various grounds  which may or may not be successful 
it is not possible to predict what  if any  additional legislation  regulation or other governmental action will be enacted or implemented and  if challenged  upheld relating to the manufacturing  design  packaging  marketing  advertising  sale or use of tobacco products  or the tobacco industry generally 
it is possible  however  that legislation  regulation or other governmental action could be enacted or implemented in the united states that might materially adversely affect the business and volume of our tobacco subsidiaries and our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
governmental investigations from time to time  altria group  inc and its subsidiaries are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 
altria group  inc and its subsidiaries cannot predict whether new investigations may be commenced 
illicit trade altria group  inc and its tobacco subsidiaries support appropriate regulations and enforcement measures to prevent illicit trade in tobacco products 
for example  altria group  inc tobacco subsidiaries are engaged in a number of initiatives to help prevent trade in contraband tobacco products  including enforcement of wholesale and retail trade programs and policies on trade in contraband tobacco products  engagement with and support of law enforcement and regulatory agencies  litigation to protect their trademarks  and support for a variety of federal and state legislative initiatives 
legislative initiatives to address trade in contraband tobacco products are designed to protect the legitimate channels of distribution  impose more stringent penalties for the violation of illegal trade laws and provide additional tools for law enforcement 
regulatory measures and related governmental actions to prevent the illicit manufacture and trade of tobacco products continue to evolve as the nature of illicit tobacco products evolves 
for example  in march  the president signed into law the prevent all cigarette trafficking pact act  which addresses illegal internet sales by  among other things  imposing a series of restrictions and requirements on the delivery sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products and makes such products non mailable to consumers through the united states postal service  subject to limited exceptions 
certain internet cigarette sellers filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of various aspects of this statute and sought injunctive relief in the united states district courts for the district of columbia  the western district of new york and the eastern district of pennsylvania 
in the western district of new york  the district court enjoined only certain elements of the 
table of contents pact act  including a requirement that delivery sellers obey the laws of the jurisdiction to which they ship cigarettes 
in the district of columbia  the district court issued a preliminary injunction substantially similar to the injunctive relief issued in the western district of new york 
the united states department of justice is challenging the district of columbia injunction on appeal and is pursuing a final judgment on the merits in the western district of new york proceedings 
tobacco price  availability and quality shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and adverse weather patterns  government mandated prices and production control programs may increase or decrease the cost or reduce the quality of tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 
as with other agriculture commodities  the price of tobacco leaf can be influenced by economic conditions and imbalances in supply and demand and crop quality and availability can be influenced by variations in weather patterns  including those caused by climate change 
tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls  including government mandated prices and production control programs 
changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products and the cost of tobacco production could cause tobacco leaf prices to increase and could result in farmers growing less tobacco 
any significant change in tobacco leaf prices  quality or availability could affect our tobacco subsidiaries profitability and business 
timing of sales in the ordinary course of business  our tobacco subsidiaries are subject to many influences that can impact the timing of sales to customers  including the timing of holidays and other annual or special events  the timing of promotions  customer incentive programs and customer inventory programs  as well as the actual or speculated timing of pricing actions and tax driven price increases
