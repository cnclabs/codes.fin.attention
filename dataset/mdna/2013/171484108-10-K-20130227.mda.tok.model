legislative and regulatory changes please refer to subheading k 
legislative changes in item business of this annual report on form k for information regarding legislative and regulatory changes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those initial estimates 
our most significant estimates relate to the valuation of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be significantly affected by changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate  and to the aggregate costs for self insured liability and workers compensation claims 
additionally  estimates are used for determining income tax liabilities 
we review the carrying values of goodwill at least annually during the first quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in  in connection with our annual impairment test  we adopted asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment which allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  then the company would perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  is a comparison of the reporting unit estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
the second step requires the company to calculate an implied fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level 
if the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment change is recorded for the excess 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis included an assessment of certain qualitative factors including but not limited to macroeconomic  industry and market conditions  cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings  overall financial performance  the movement of the company share price  and other relevant entity and reporting unit specific events 
we considered the qualitative factors and weighted the evidence obtained and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
given the substantial amount of the excess of fair value over carrying value  none of our reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing step one of the annual goodwill impairment test 
although we believe the factors considered in the impairment analysis are reasonable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
in prior years  our assessment of goodwill impairment 
table of contents was largely dependent on estimates of future cash flows at the aggregated reporting unit level  and a weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows were based on assumptions and projections with respect to future revenues and expenses believed to be reasonable and supportable at the time the annual impairment analysis was performed 
further they required management judgments and took into account assumptions about overall growth rates and increases in expenses 
we consider our slots gaming rights and trademark intangible assets as indefinite lived intangible assets that do not require amortization based on our future expectations to operate our gaming facilities indefinitely  as well as our historical experience in renewing these intangible assets at minimal cost with various state gaming commissions 
rather  these intangible assets are tested annually  or more frequently  if indicators of impairment exist  for impairment by comparing the fair value of the recorded assets to their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the slots gaming rights and trademark intangible assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
we assign estimated useful lives to our definite lived intangible assets based on the period of time the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
we consider certain factors when assigning useful lives such as legal  regulatory  competition and other economic factors 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight line method 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives and fair values 
changes in assumptions may cause modifications to our estimates for amortization or impairment  thereby impacting our results of operations 
if the estimated lives of our definite lived intangible assets were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  amortization expense could increase significantly 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs which changes the wording used to describe the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in order to improve consistency in the application and description of fair value between gaap and ifrs 
asu clarifies how the concepts of highest and best use and valuation premise in a fair value measurement are relevant only when measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets and are not relevant when measuring the fair value of financial assets or liabilities 
in addition  the guidance expanded the disclosures for the unobservable inputs for level fair value measurements  requiring quantitative information to be disclosed related to the valuation processes used  the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those unobservable inputs  and use of a nonfinancial asset in a way that differs from the asset s highest and best use 
the revised guidance became effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after december  the company adopted the standard for the year ended december   and there was no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
our business can be impacted positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes  by economic conditions and by gaming competition 
a significant negative impact from these activities could result in a significant impairment of our property and equipment and or our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by competition and legislative changes is included in subheading j 
competition and subheading k 
legislative changes  respectively  in item business of this annual report on form k 
in connection with losses incurred from natural disasters  insurance proceeds are collected on existing business interruption and property and casualty insurance policies 
when losses are sustained in one period and the amounts to be recovered are collected in a subsequent period  management uses estimates and judgment to determine the amounts that are probable of recovery under such policies 
estimated losses  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  are recognized in the period the natural disaster occurs and the amount of the loss is determinable 
insurance recoveries in excess of estimated losses are recognized when realizable 
we also use estimates and judgments for financial reporting to determine our current tax liability  as well as those taxes deferred until future periods 
net deferred and accrued income taxes represent significant assets and liabilities of the company 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes  we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
adjustments to deferred taxes are determined based upon changes in differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  measured by enacted tax rates we estimate will be applicable when these differences are expected to reverse 
changes in current tax laws  enacted tax rates or the estimated level of taxable income or non deductible expenses could change the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and affect the overall effective tax rate and tax provision 
in  our business insurance renewals included substantially the same coverage and retentions as in previous years 
we estimate insurance liabilities for workers compensation and general liability losses based on our historical loss experience  
table of contents certain actuarial assumptions of loss development factors and current industry trends 
any changes in our assumptions  actuarial assumptions or loss experience could impact our total insurance cost and overall results of operations 
our significant accounting policies and recently adopted accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in
