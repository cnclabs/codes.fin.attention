more information regarding this measurement and reconciliation to the comparable gaap measurement is provided under the heading results of operations overview below 
net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest margin resulted from the decline in non covered loan yields  the decrease in average covered loan balances and the decline in investment yields  partially offset by a decrease in average interest bearing cash  the increase in average non covered loans outstanding  an increase in loan disposal gains from the covered loan portfolio  a decrease in interest bearing liabilities and the decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits 
excluding the impact of loan disposal gains from the covered loan portfolio and interest and fee reversals on non accrual loans  our adjusted net interest margin was for the year ended december   as compared to adjusted net interest margin of for the year ended december  adjusted net interest margin is considered a non gaap financial measure

summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec definition 
allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the bank performs regular credit reviews of the loan and lease portfolio to determine the credit quality and adherence to underwriting standards 
when loans and leases are originated  they are assigned a risk rating that is reassessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process 
consumer and residential loan portfolios are reviewed monthly for their performance as a pool of loans  since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating  size or potential risk of loss 
in contrast  the monitoring process for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan by loan basis 
the company s risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from to  where a higher rating represents higher risk 
the risk rating categories are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank has a management allowance for loan and lease losses alll committee  which is responsible for  among other things  regularly reviewing the alll methodology  including loss factors  and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the alll committee reviews and approves loans and leases recommended for impaired status 
the alll committee also approves removing loans and leases from impaired status 
the bank s audit and compliance committee provides board oversight of the alll process and reviews and approves the alll methodology on a quarterly basis 
each risk rating is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses provided for that group of loans and leases with similar risk rating 
credit loss factors may vary by region based on management belief that there may ultimately be different credit loss rates experienced in each region 
regular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired 
potentially impaired loans are referred to the alll committee which reviews and approves designated loans as impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events  we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract  including scheduled interest payments 
when we identify a loan as impaired  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows  except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral for collateral dependent loans 
a loan is considered collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and there are no other available and reliable sources of repayment 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of the collateral  less selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
if we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we either recognize an impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses or charge off the impaired balance on collateral dependent loans if it is determined that such amount represents a confirmed loss 
the combination of the risk rating based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank may also maintain an unallocated allowance amount to provide for other credit losses inherent in a loan and lease portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the credit loss factors 
this unallocated amount generally comprises less than of the allowance  but may be maintained at higher levels during times of economic conditions characterized by falling real estate values 
the unallocated amount is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses  the results of credit reviews and overall economic trends 
as of december   there was no unallocated allowance amount 

table of contents the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc is established to absorb inherent losses associated with our commitment to lend funds  such as with a letter or line of credit 
the adequacy of the alll and ruc are monitored on a regular basis and are based on management evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience  and other pertinent information 
management believes that the alll was adequate as of december  there is  however  no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the alll and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 
approximately of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  and a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
covered loans and fdic indemnification asset loans acquired in an fdic assisted acquisition that are subject to a loss share agreement are referred to as covered loans and reported separately in our statements of financial condition 
acquired loans were aggregated into pools based on individually evaluated common risk characteristics and aggregate expected cash flows were estimated for each pool 
a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single interest rate  cumulative loss rate and cash flow expectation 
the cash flows expected to be received over the life of the pool were estimated by management with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
these cash flows were input into a fasb asc  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality asc  compliant accounting loan system which calculates the carrying values of the pools and underlying loans  book yields  effective interest income and impairment  if any  based on actual and projected events 
default rates  loss severity  and prepayment speeds assumptions are periodically reassessed and updated within the accounting model to update our expectation of future cash flows 
the excess of the cash flows expected to be collected over a pool s carrying value is considered to be the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the estimated life of the loan or pool using the effective yield method 
the accretable yield may change due to changes in the timing and amounts of expected cash flows 
changes in the accretable yield are disclosed quarterly 
the company has elected to account for amounts receivable under the loss share agreement as an indemnification asset in accordance with fasb asc  business combinations asc 
the fdic indemnification asset is initially recorded at fair value  based on the discounted value of expected future cash flows under the loss share agreement 
the difference between the carrying value and the undiscounted cash flows the company expects to collect from the fdic will be accreted or amortized into non interest income over the life of the fdic indemnification asset  which is maintained at the loan pool level 
mortgage servicing rights msr in accordance with fasb asc  transfers and servicing asc 
the company determines its classes of servicing assets based on the asset type being serviced along with the methods used to manage the risk inherent in the servicing assets  which includes the market inputs used to value the servicing assets 
the company elected to measure its residential mortgage servicing assets at fair value and to report changes in fair value through earnings 
fair value adjustments encompass market driven valuation changes and the runoff in value that occurs from the passage of time  which are separately reported 
under the fair value method  the msr is carried in the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are reported in earnings under the caption mortgage banking revenue in the period in which the change occurs 
retained mortgage servicing rights are measured at fair value as of the date of sale 
we use quoted market prices when available 
subsequent fair value measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
in order to determine the fair value of the msr  the present value of expected future cash flows is estimated 
assumptions used include market discount rates  anticipated prepayment speeds  delinquency and foreclosure rates  and ancillary fee income 
this model is periodically validated by an independent external model validation group 
the model assumptions and the msr fair value estimates are also compared to observable trades of similar portfolios as well as to msr broker valuations and industry surveys  as available 
the expected life of the loan can vary from management estimates due to prepayments by borrowers  especially when rates fall 
prepayments in excess of management estimates would negatively impact the recorded value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the value of the mortgage servicing rights is also dependent upon the discount rate used in the model  which we base on current market rates 
management reviews this rate on an ongoing basis based on current market rates 
a significant increase in the discount rate would reduce the value of mortgage servicing rights

table of contents valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   we had million in goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of business combinations 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis as of december additionally  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated on an interim basis when events or circumstance indicate impairment potentially exists 
the impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions 
there can be no assurance that changes in circumstances  estimates or assumption may result in additional impairment of all  or some portion of  goodwill 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis of the community banking reporting segment as of december  in the first step of the goodwill impairment test the company determined that the fair value of the community banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
the impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  changes in discount rates and specific industry and market conditions 
there can be no assurance that changes in circumstances  estimates or assumption will not result in additional impairment of all  or some portion of  goodwill 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc  stock compensation  we recognize expense in the income statement for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions 
the fair value of each grant is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model or a monte carlo simulation pricing model 
management assumptions utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the pricing model  and ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fair value fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value

umpqua recognizes gains or losses on our junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value resulting from the estimated market credit risk adjusted spread and changes in interest rates that do not directly correlate with the company s operating performance 
also  umpqua incurs significant expenses related to the completion and integration of mergers and acquisitions 
additionally  we may recognize goodwill impairment losses that have no direct effect on the company s or the bank s cash balances  liquidity  or regulatory capital ratios 
lastly  umpqua may recognize one time bargain purchase gains on certain fdic assisted acquisitions that are not reflective of umpqua s on going earnings power 
accordingly  management believes that our operating results are best measured on a comparative basis excluding the impact of gains or losses on junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value  net of tax  merger related expenses  net of tax  and other charges related to business combinations such as goodwill impairment charges or bargain purchase gains  net of tax 
we define operating earnings as earnings available to common shareholders before gains or losses on junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value  net of tax  bargain purchase gains on acquisitions  net of tax  merger related expenses  net of tax  and goodwill impairment  and we calculate operating earnings per diluted share by dividing operating earnings by the same diluted share total used in determining diluted earnings per common share see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
operating earnings and operating earnings per diluted share are considered non gaap financial measures 
although we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides a better indication of our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below

management believes adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest margin are useful financial measures because they enable investors to evaluate the underlying growth or compression in these values excluding interest income adjustments related to credit quality 
management uses these measures to evaluate adjusted net interest income operating results exclusive of credit costs  in order to monitor our effectiveness in growing higher interest yielding assets and managing our cost of interest bearing liabilities over time 
adjusted net interest income is calculated as net interest income  adjusting tax exempt interest income to its taxable equivalent  adding back interest and fee reversals related to new non accrual loans during the period  and deducting the interest income gains recognized from loan disposition activities within covered loan pools 
adjusted net interest margin is calculated by dividing adjusted net interest income by a period s average interest earning assets 
adjusted net interest income and adjusted net interest margin are considered non gaap financial measures 
although we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides a better indication of our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below

table of contents the following table presents the returns on average assets  average common shareholders equity and average tangible common shareholders equity for the years ended december    and for each of the periods presented  the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net earnings available to common shareholders and operating income as shown in the table above 
our return on average common shareholders equity is negatively impacted as the result of capital required to support goodwill 
to the extent this performance metric is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisition related intangible assets  we believe it beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders equity 
the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by average shareholders common equity less average goodwill and intangible assets  net excluding msrs 
the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is considered a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders equity

umpqua believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for period to period and company to company comparisons  which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the company 
tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less preferred stock and less goodwill and other intangible assets  net excluding msrs 
in addition  tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets  net excluding msrs 
the tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders equity divided by tangible assets 
the tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio is considered a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the total shareholders equity and the total shareholders equity ratio

although we believe these non gaap financial measure are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap 
net interest income net interest income is the largest source of our operating income 
net interest income for was million  a decrease of million or compared to the same period in the decrease in net interest income in as compared to is attributable to a decrease in outstanding average interest earning assets  primarily covered loans  investment securities and interest bearing cash  and a decrease in net interest margin  partially offset by an increase in non covered loans and leases and a decrease in interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for was million  an increase of million  or over the increase in net interest income in as compared to is attributable to growth in outstanding average interest earning assets  primarily average covered loans and average investment securities  increased covered loan yields  decreased cost of deposits and investing excess interest earning cash into the investment portfolio  partially offset by a decline in average non covered loans outstanding  lower non covered loan yields  lower investment yields  and increased average interest bearing deposit balances 
the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interest earnings assets on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  a decrease of basis points as compared to the same period in the decrease in net interest margin primarily resulted from a decline in non covered loan yields  decrease in average covered loans outstanding  a decrease in loan disposal gains from the covered loan portfolio  and a decline in investment yields  partially offset by a decrease in average interest bearing cash  an increase in average non covered loans outstanding  a decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits  and a decrease in average interest bearing liabilities 
loan disposal related activities within the covered loan portfolio  either through loans being paid off in full or transferred to other real estate owned oreo  result in gains within covered loan interest income to the extent assets received in satisfaction of debt such as cash or the net realizable value of oreo received exceeds the allocated carrying value of the loan disposed of from the pool 
loan disposal activities contributed million of interest income for  compared to million of interest income for and million for while dispositions of covered loans positively impact net interest margin  we recognize a corresponding decrease to the change in fdic indemnification asset at the incremental loss sharing rate within other non interest income 
net interest income for was negatively impacted by million reversal of interest and fee income on non covered  non accrual loans  as compared to million for and million for excluding the impact of covered loan disposal gains and interest and fee income reversals on non covered  non accrual loans  tax equivalent net interest margin would have been   and for   and respectively 
partially offsetting the decrease in net interest margin in as compared to is the continued reduction in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  specifically interest bearing deposits 
the total cost of interest bearing deposits for was  representing a decrease of basis points compared to 
table of contents the net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  an increase of two basis points as compared to the same period in the increase in net interest margin primarily resulted from an increase in average covered loans and investment balances  a decrease in interest bearing cash  and a decrease in our interest expense to earning assets of basis points due to declining costs of interest bearing deposits  partially offset by a decrease in average non covered loan balances  and decline in investment yields 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as changes in the yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds

therefore  the non covered  non accrual loans of million as of december  have already been written down to their estimated fair value  less estimated costs to sell  and are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss  absent further decline in market prices 
depending on the characteristics of a loan  the fair value of collateral is estimated by obtaining external appraisals 
the provision for non covered loan and lease losses is based on management evaluation of inherent risks in the loan portfolio and a corresponding analysis of the allowance for non covered loan and lease losses 
additional discussion on loan quality and the allowance for non covered loan and lease losses is provided under the heading asset quality and non performing assets below

provisions may be required when determined losses of unpaid principal incurred exceed previous loss expectations to date  or future cash flows previously expected to be collectible are no longer probable of collection 
provisions for covered loan and lease losses  including amounts advanced subsequent to acquisition  are not reflected in the allowance for non covered loan and lease losses  rather as a valuation allowance netted against the carrying value of the covered loan and lease balance accounted for under asc  in accordance with the guidance

absent future changes to the significant inputs utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to measure the fair value of these instruments  the cumulative discount for each junior subordinated debenture will reverse over time  ultimately returning the carrying values of these instruments to their notional value at their expected redemption dates 
this will result in recognizing losses on junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value within non interest income 
the decrease in the gain recognized from to the loss recognized in primarily resulted from the widening of the credit risk adjusted spread over the contractual rate of each junior subordinated debenture measured at fair value 
additional information on the junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and under the heading junior subordinated debentures

weighted average yields for available for sale investments have been calculated on an amortized cost basis 
the mortgage related securities in serial maturities in the table above include both pooled mortgage backed issues and high quality collaterized mortgage obligation structures  with an average duration of years 
these mortgage related securities provide yield spread to us treasury or agency securities  however  the cash flows arising from them can be volatile due to refinancing of the underlying mortgage loans 
the equity security in other investment securities in the table above at december  principally represents an investment in a community reinvestment act investment fund comprised largely of mortgage backed securities  although funds may also invest in municipal bonds  certificates of deposit  repurchase agreements  or securities issued by other investment companies 
we review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other than temporary impairment otti or permanent impairment  taking into consideration current market conditions  fair value in relationship to cost  extent and nature of the change in fair value  issuer rating changes and trends  whether we intend to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment  which may be maturity  and other factors 
for debt securities  if we intend to sell the security or it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis  the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings as an otti 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security  only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings 
the credit loss on a security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected 
projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential otti 
the remaining impairment related to all other factors  the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and fair value  is recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income oci 
impairment losses related to all other factors are presented as separate categories within oci 
for investment securities held to maturity  this amount is accreted over the remaining life of the debt security prospectively based on the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows 
the accretion of the otti amount recorded in oci will increase the carrying value of the investment  and would not affect earnings 
if there is an indication of additional credit losses the security is reevaluated according to the procedures described above

fhlb stock is carried at par and does not have a readily determinable fair value 
ownership of fhlb stock is restricted to the fhlb and member institutions  and can only be purchased and redeemed at par 
in september  the fhlb of seattle was notified by the federal housing finance agency finance agency that it is now classified as adequately capitalized as compared to the prior classification of undercapitalized 
under finance agency regulations  the fhlb of seattle may repurchase excess capital stock under certain conditions  however they may not redeem stock or pay a dividend without finance agency approval 
management periodically evaluates fhlb stock for other than temporary or permanent impairment 
management s determination of whether these investments are impaired is based on its assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value 
the determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of the cost is influenced by criteria such as the significance of any decline in net assets of the fhlb as compared to the capital stock amount of the fhlb and the length of time this situation has persisted  the compliance with the minimum financial metrics required as part of the consent arrangement the bank has with the finance agency  the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and  accordingly  the customer base of the fhlb  and the liquidity position of the fhlb

table of contents discussion of and tables related to the covered loan segment is provided under the heading asset quality and non performing assets 
asset quality and non performing assets non covered loans and leases we manage asset quality and control credit risk through diversification of the non covered loan portfolio and the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan monitoring practices 
the bank credit quality group is charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the bank 
the provision for non covered loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
the amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the non covered loan portfolio  delinquencies  management assessment of loan portfolio quality  general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral  and other trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
reviews of non performing  past due non covered loans and larger credits  designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses  and to determine the adequacy of the allowance  are conducted on a quarterly basis 
these reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  loan loss experience  estimated loan losses  growth in the loan portfolio  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
additional information regarding the methodology used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is contained in part i item of this report in the section titled lending and credit functions 
non covered  non performing loans  which include non covered  non accrual loans and non covered accruing loans past due over days  totaled million or of total non covered loans as of december   as compared to million  or of total non covered loans  at december  non covered  non performing assets  which include non covered  non performing loans and non covered  foreclosed real estate other real estate owned  totaled million  or of total assets as of december  compared with million  or of total assets as of december  the decrease in non performing assets in is attributable to the improving economic environment  an improvement in real estate values in our markets and the resulting impact on our commercial real estate and commercial construction portfolio 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  we determine it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract  including scheduled interest payments 
generally  when non covered loans are identified as impaired they are moved to our special assets division 
when we identify a loan as impaired  we measure the loan for potential impairment using discount cash flows  except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of collateral  less selling costs 
the starting point for determining the fair value of collateral is through obtaining external appraisals 
generally  external appraisals are updated every six to nine months 
we obtain appraisals from a pre approved list of independent  third party  local appraisal firms 
approval and addition to the list is based on experience  reputation  character  consistency and knowledge of the respective real estate market 
at a minimum  it is ascertained that the appraiser is a currently licensed in the state in which the property is located  b is experienced in the appraisal of properties similar to the property being appraised  c is actively engaged in the appraisal work  d has knowledge of current real estate market conditions and financing trends  e is reputable  and f is not on freddie mac s or the bank s exclusionary list of appraisers and brokers 
in certain cases appraisals will be reviewed by our real estate valuation services group to ensure the quality of the appraisal and the expertise and independence of the appraiser 
upon receipt and review  an external appraisal is utilized to measure a loan for potential impairment 
our impairment analysis documents the date of the appraisal used in the analysis  whether the officer preparing the report deems it current  and  if not  allows for internal valuation adjustments with justification 
typical justified adjustments might include discounts for continued market deterioration subsequent to appraisal date  adjustments for the release of collateral contemplated in the appraisal  or the value of other collateral or consideration not contemplated in the appraisal 
an appraisal over one year old in most cases will be considered stale dated and an updated or new appraisal will be required 
any adjustments from appraised value to net realizable value are detailed and justified in the impairment analysis  which is reviewed and approved by senior credit quality officers and the company allowance for loan and lease losses alll committee 
although an external appraisal is the primary source to value collateral dependent loans  we may also utilize values obtained through purchase and sale agreements  negotiated short sales  broker price opinions  or the sales price of the note 
these alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution 
impairment analyses are updated  reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis at or near the end of each reporting period 
appraisals or other alternative sources of value received subsequent to the reporting period  but prior to our filing of periodic reports  are considered and evaluated to ensure our periodic filings are materially correct and not misleading 
based on these processes  we do not believe there are significant time lapses for the recognition of additional loan loss provisions or charge offs from the date they become known 
non covered loans are classified as non accrual when collection of principal or interest is doubtful generally if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by days or more unless such non covered loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
additionally  all loans that are impaired are considered for non accrual status 
non covered loans placed on non accrual will typically remain on non accrual status until all principal and interest payments are brought current and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear relatively certain 

table of contents upon acquisition of real estate collateral  typically through the foreclosure process  we promptly begin to market the property for sale 
if we do not begin to receive offers or indications of interest we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether a lower price reflects the market value of the property and would enable us to sell the property 
in addition  we update appraisals on other real estate owned property six to nine months after the most recent appraisal 
increases in valuation adjustments recorded in a period are primarily based on a updated appraisals received during the period  or b management authorization to reduce the selling price of the property during the period 
unless a current appraisal is available  an appraisal will be ordered prior to a loan moving to other real estate owned 
foreclosed properties held as other real estate owned are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or market value of the property less expected selling costs 
non covered other real estate owned at december  totaled million and consisted of properties 
non covered loans are reported as restructured when the bank grants a concession s to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties that it would not otherwise consider 
examples of such concessions include a reduction in the loan rate  forgiveness of principal or accrued interest  extending the maturity date s or providing a lower interest rate than would be normally available for a transaction of similar risk 
as a result of these concessions  restructured loans are impaired as the bank will not collect all amounts due  both principal and interest  in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
impairment reserves on non collateral dependent restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows on the restructured loans discounted at the interest rate of the original loan agreement to the loan s carrying value 
these impairment reserves are recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the company has written down impaired  non covered non accrual loans as of december  to their estimated net realizable value  based on disposition value  and expects resolution with no additional material loss  absent further decline in market prices

table of contents the company is continually performing extensive reviews of our permanent commercial real estate portfolio  including stress testing 
these reviews were performed on both our non owner and owner occupied credits 
these reviews were completed to verify leasing status  to ensure the accuracy of risk ratings  and to develop proactive action plans with borrowers on projects where debt service coverage has dropped below the bank s benchmark 
the stress testing has been performed to determine the effect of rising cap rates  interest rates and vacancy rates  on this portfolio 
based on our analysis  the company believes our lending teams are effectively managing the risks in this portfolio 
there can be no assurance that any further declines in economic conditions  such as potential increases in retail or office vacancy rates  will exceed the projected assumptions utilized in the stress testing and may result in additional non covered  non performing loans in the future

table of contents allowance for non covered loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for non covered loan and lease losses alll totaled million at december   a decrease of million from the million at december  the decrease in the alll from the prior year end results is principally attributable to net charge offs exceeding the non covered provision for loan and lease losses and improved credit quality of our portfolio 
additional discussion on the change in provision for loan and lease losses is provided under the heading provision for loan and lease losses above 
the unallocated portion of alll provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk rating based component  or in the specific impairment reserve component of the allowance for loan and lease losses  and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models 
as of december   there was no unallocated allowance for loan and lease losses  compared to at december  the level in unallocated alll in the current year reflects management s evaluation of the existing general business and economic conditions  and improving credit quality and collateral values of real estate in our markets as compared to the alll composition should not be interpreted as an indication of specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge offs may occur

if the measurement of each impaired loans value is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we recognize this impairment and adjust the carrying value of the loan to fair value through the allowance for loan and lease losses 
this can be accomplished by charging off the impaired portion of the loan or establishing a specific component within the allowance for loan and lease losses 
if in management s assessment the sources of repayment will not result in a reasonable probability that the carrying value of a loan can be recovered  the amount of a loan s specific impairment is charged off against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the company recognizes the charge off of impairment reserves on impaired loans in the period they arise for collateral dependent loans 
impairment reserves on non collateral dependent restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows on the restructured loans discounted at the interest rate of the original loan agreement to the loan s carrying value 
these impairment reserves are recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
at december   the recorded investment in non covered loans classified as impaired totaled million  with a corresponding valuation allowance included in the allowance for loan and lease losses of million 
the valuation allowance on impaired loans represents the impairment reserves on performing current and former non covered restructured loans and nonaccrual loans 
at december   the total recorded investment in non covered impaired loans was million  with a corresponding valuation allowance included in the allowance for loan and lease losses of million

therefore  the adequacy of the alll and ruc cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 

table of contents allowance for covered loan and lease losses the allowance for covered loan and lease losses alll totaled million at december   an increase of million from the million at december  the increase in the covered alll from the prior year end results from changes in the amount and the timing of expected cash flows on the acquired loans compared to those previously estimated and charge offs of unpaid principal balance against previously established allowance  as measured on a pool basis

information related to our serviced loan portfolio as of december    and was as follows dollars in thousands december  december  december  balance of loans serviced for others msr as a percentage of serviced loans as of december   we serviced residential mortgage loans for others with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of billion for which servicing assets have been recorded 
mortgage servicing rights are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in mortgage banking revenue 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is impacted by market rates for mortgage loans 
historically low market rates can cause prepayments to increase as a result of refinancing activity 
to the extent loans are prepaid sooner than estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded  it is possible that certain mortgage servicing rights assets may decrease in value 
generally  the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall 
additional information about the company s mortgage servicing rights is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million  as compared to million at december  the goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill increased in over as a result of the circle bancorp acquisition 
at december   we had recorded goodwill of million  as compared to million at december  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management evaluates intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis as of december additionally  we perform impairment evaluations on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate impairment potentially exists 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others  a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  and unanticipated competition 

table of contents under recently issued guidance  the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment before completing the goodwill impairment test two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  the company would be required to proceed to the second step 
in the second step the company calculates the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the estimated fair value of the company is allocated to all of the company s assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  as if the company had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is the price paid to acquire it 
the allocation process is performed only for purposes of determining the amount of goodwill impairment 
no assets or liabilities are written up or down  nor are any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets recorded as a part of this process 
any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings in an amount equal to that excess 
the company performs the first step on an annual basis and in between if certain events or circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
the company conducted its annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment as of december  for both the community banking and wealth management segments 
in the first step of the goodwill impairment test  the company determined for both segments that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
no goodwill impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented 
at december   we had other intangible assets of million  as compared to million at december  as part of a business acquisition  a portion of the purchase price is allocated to the other value of intangible assets such as core deposits  which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit 
the value of these other intangible assets were determined by a third party based on an analysis of the cost differential between the core deposits and alternative funding sources for the core deposit intangible 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives  and are also reviewed for impairment 
we amortize other intangible assets on an accelerated or straight line basis over an estimated ten to fifteen year life 
other intangible assets decreased in over as a result of intangible asset amortization  offset by recognition of intangible assets associated with of the circle bancorp acquisition 
no impairment losses separate from the scheduled amortization have been recognized in the periods presented

deposits total deposits were billion at december   an increase of million  or  as compared to year end of the total change in deposit balances during the current year  there were million deposits acquired with the circle bank acquisition 
excluding acquired deposits  deposits declined million due to the run off of higher priced time deposits and decrease in public funds  which management attributes to the ability to reduce our cost of deposits while maintaining our overall deposit base and grow certain lines of business to ongoing business development and marketing efforts in our service markets

at december  and december   the company s cdars balances totaled million and million  respectively 
of these totals  at december  and december   million and million  respectively  represented time deposits equal to or greater than  but were fully insured under current deposit insurance limits 
the dodd frank act provided for unlimited deposit insurance for non interest bearing transactions accounts  excluding now interest bearing deposit accounts and including all ioltas lawyers trust accounts  beginning december  for a period of two years 
the program expired december  the dodd frank act permanently raises the current standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount from  to  per qualified account 
borrowings at december   the bank had outstanding million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and no outstanding federal funds purchased balances 
additional information regarding securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased is provided in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the bank had outstanding term debt of million at december   primarily with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
term debt outstanding as of december  decreased million since december  as a result of accretion of purchase accounting adjustments 
management expects continued use of fhlb advances as a source of short and long term funding 
advances from the fhlb amounted to million of the total term debt and are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate 
the fhlb advances have fixed contractual interest rates ranging from to and mature in and additional information regarding term debt is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
junior subordinated debentures we had junior subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in junior subordinated debentures from to is due to million assumed in the acquisition of circle bancorp and an increase in fair value of million for those carried at fair value 

table of contents at december   approximately million  or of the total issued amount  had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over three month libor 
interest expense for junior subordinated debentures increased slightly in as compared to and  primarily resulting from increases in three month libor 
although increases in three month libor will increase the interest expense for junior subordinated debentures  we believe that other attributes of our balance sheet will serve to mitigate the impact to net interest income on a consolidated basis 
on january   the company elected the fair value measurement option for certain pre existing junior subordinated debentures of million the umpqua statutory trusts 
the remaining junior subordinated debentures as of the adoption date were acquired through business combinations and were measured at fair value at the time of acquisition 
in  the company issued two series of trust preferred securities and elected to measure each instrument at fair value 
accounting for junior subordinated debentures originally issued by the company at fair value enables us to more closely align our financial performance with the economic value of those liabilities 
additionally  we believe it improves our ability to manage the market and interest rate risks associated with the junior subordinated debentures 
the junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value and amortized cost have been presented as separate line items on the balance sheet 
the ending carrying fair value of the junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value represents the estimated amount that would be paid to transfer these liabilities in an orderly transaction amongst market participants under current market conditions as of the measurement date 
the significant inputs utilized in the estimation of fair value of these instruments are the credit risk adjusted spread and three month libor 
the credit risk adjusted spread represents the nonperformance risk of the liability  contemplating the inherent risk of the obligation 
generally  an increase in the credit risk adjusted spread and or a decrease in the three month libor will result in positive fair value adjustments 
conversely  a decrease in the credit risk adjusted spread and or an increase in the three month libor will result in negative fair value adjustments 
through the first quarter of we obtained valuations from a third party pricing service to assist with the estimation and determination of fair value of these liabilities 
in these valuations  the credit risk adjusted interest spread for potential new issuances through the primary market and implied spreads of these instruments when traded as assets on the secondary market  were estimated to be significantly higher than the contractual spread of our junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value 
the difference between these spreads has resulted in the cumulative gain in fair value  reducing the carrying value of these instruments as reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
in july  the dodd frank act was signed into law which  among other things  limits the ability of certain bank holding companies to treat trust preferred security debt issuances as tier capital 
this law may require many banks to raise new tier capital and is expected to effectively close the trust preferred securities markets from offering new issuances in the future 
as a result of this legislation  our third party pricing service noted that they were no longer able to provide reliable fair value estimates related to these liabilities given the absence of observable or comparable transactions in the market place in recent history or as anticipated into the future 
due to inactivity in the junior subordinated debenture market and the inability to obtain observable quotes of our  or similar  junior subordinated debenture liabilities or the related trust preferred securities when traded as assets  we utilize an income approach valuation technique to determine the fair value of these liabilities using our estimation of market discount rate assumptions 
the company monitors activity in the trust preferred and related markets  to the extent available  changes related to the current and anticipated future interest rate environment  and considers our entity specific creditworthiness  to validate the reasonableness of the credit risk adjusted spread and effective yield utilized in our discounted cash flow model 
regarding the activity in and condition of the junior subordinated debt market  we noted no observable changes in the current period as it relates to companies comparable to our size and condition  in either the primary or secondary markets 
relating to the interest rate environment  we considered the change in slope and shape of the forward libor swap curve in the current period  the effects of which did not result in a significant change in the fair value of these liabilities 
the company s specific credit risk is implicit in the credit risk adjusted spread used to determine the fair value of our junior subordinated debentures 
as our company is not specifically rated by any credit agency  it is difficult to specifically attribute changes in our estimate of the applicable credit risk adjusted spread to specific changes in our own creditworthiness versus changes in the market s required return from similar companies 
as a result  these considerations must be largely based off of qualitative considerations as we do not have a credit rating and we do not regularly issue senior or subordinated debt that would provide us an independent measure of the changes in how the market quantifies our perceived default risk 

table of contents on a quarterly basis we assess entity specific qualitative considerations that if not mitigated or represents a material change from the prior reporting period may result in a change to the perceived creditworthiness and ultimately the estimated credit risk adjusted spread utilized to value these liabilities 
entity specific considerations that positively impact our creditworthiness include our strong capital position resulting from our successful public stock offerings in and  that offers us flexibility to pursue business opportunities such as mergers and acquisitions  or expand our footprint and product offerings  having significant levels of on and off balance sheet liquidity  being profitable  and  having an experienced management team 
however  these positive considerations are mitigated by significant risks and uncertainties that impact our creditworthiness and ability to maintain capital adequacy in the future 
specific risks and concerns include given our concentration of loans secured by real estate in our loan portfolio  a continued and sustained deterioration of the real estate market may result in declines in the value of the underlying collateral and increased delinquencies that could result in an increased of charge offs  despite recent improvement  our credit quality metrics remain negatively elevated since relative to historical standards  the continuation of current economic downturn that has been particularly severe in our primary markets could adversely affect our business  recent increased regulation facing our industry  such as the esaa  arra and the dodd frank act  will increase the cost of compliance and restrict our ability to conduct business consistent with historical practices  and could negatively impact profitability  we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets that dilute our available tangible common equity  and the carrying value of certain material  recently recorded assets on our balance sheet  such as the fdic loss sharing indemnification asset  are highly reliant on management estimates  such as the timing or amount of losses that are estimated to be covered  and the assumed continued compliance with the provisions of the loss share agreement 
to the extent assumptions ultimately prove incorrect or should we consciously forego or unknowingly violate the guidelines of the agreement  an impairment of the asset may result which would reduce capital 
additionally  the company periodically utilizes an external valuation firm to determine or validate the reasonableness of the assessments of inputs and factors that ultimately determines the estimate fair value of these liabilities 
the extent we involve or engage these external third parties correlates to management s assessment of the current subordinate debt market  how the current environment and market compares to the preceding quarter  and perceived changes in the company s own creditworthiness during the quarter 
in periods of potential significant valuation changes and at year end reporting periods we typically engage third parties to perform a full independent valuation of these liabilities 
for periods where management has assessed the market and other factors impacting the underlying valuation assumptions of these liabilities  and has determined significant changes to the valuation of these liabilities in the current period are remote  the scope of the valuation specialist s review is limited to a review the reasonableness of management s assessment of inputs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company engaged an external valuation firm to prepare an independent valuation of our junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value and the results were consistent with the company s valuation 
absent changes to the significant inputs utilized in the discounted cash flow model used to measure the fair value of these instruments at each reporting period  the cumulative discount for each junior subordinated debenture will reverse over time  ultimately returning the carrying values of these instruments to their notional values at their expected redemption dates  in a manner similar to the effective yield method as if these instruments were accounted for under the amortized cost method 
for the year ended december    and  we recorded a loss of million  a loss of million  and a gain of million  respectively  resulting from the change in fair value of the junior subordinated debentures recorded at fair value 
observable activity in the junior subordinated debenture and related markets in future periods may change the effective rate used to discount these liabilities  and could result in additional fair value adjustments gains or losses on junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value outside the expected periodic change in fair value had the fair value assumptions remained unchanged 
as noted above  the dodd frank act limits the ability of certain bank holding companies to treat trust preferred security debt issuances as tier capital 
as the company had less than billion in assets at december   under the dodd frank act  the company will be able to continue to include its existing trust preferred securities  less the common stock of the trusts  in tier capital 
however  under a recently issued notice of proposed rulemaking by federal banking regulators to revise the regulatory capital rules to incorporate certain revisions by the basel committee on banking supervision to the basel capital framework basel iii  the trust preferred security debt issuances would be phased out of tier capital into tier capital over a year period 
if the proposed rulemaking becomes effective  it is possible the company may accelerate redemption of the existing junior subordinated debentures 
this could result in adjustments to the fair value of these instruments including the acceleration of losses on junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value within non interest income 
at december   the company restricted core capital elements were of total core capital  net of goodwill and any associated deferred tax liability 
the contractual interest expense on junior subordinated debentures continues to be recorded on an accrual basis and is reported in interest expense 
the junior subordinated debentures recorded at fair value of million had contractual unpaid principal amounts of million outstanding as of december  the junior subordinated debentures recorded at fair value of million had contractual unpaid principal amounts of million outstanding as of december  additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below

additional information regarding the terms of the junior subordinated debentures  including maturity redemption dates  interest rates and the fair value election  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the bank ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs 
we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position 
one source of funds includes public deposits 
individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits  typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of fdic insurance 
public deposits represent and of total deposits at december  and at december   respectively 
the amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state  depending on the individual state s risk assessment of depository institutions 
changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits  drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement  or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the bank 
in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities  the bank can utilize established uncommitted federal funds lines of credit  sell securities under agreements to repurchase  borrow on a secured basis from the fhlb or issue brokered certificates of deposit 
the bank had available lines of credit with the fhlb totaling billion at december  subject to certain collateral requirements  namely the amount of pledged loans and investment securities 
the bank had available lines of credit with the federal reserve totaling million subject to certain collateral requirements  namely the amount of certain pledged loans 
the bank had uncommitted federal funds line of credit agreements with additional financial institutions totaling million at december  availability of lines is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility 
these lines are intended to support short term liquidity needs  and the agreements may restrict consecutive day usage 
the company is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of the company revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
there were million of dividends paid by the bank to the company in there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
we believe that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of the company to fund its quarterly cash dividend distributions to common shareholders and meet its ongoing cash obligations  which consist principally of debt service on the million issued amount of outstanding junior subordinated debentures 
as of december   the company did not have any borrowing arrangements of its own 
as disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the difference between cash provided by operating activities and net income largely consisted of originations of loans held for sale of billion offset by proceeds from the sale of loans held for sale of billion 
net cash of million provided by investing activities consisted principally of proceeds from investment securities available for sale of billion  net covered loan paydowns of million  net proceeds from the fdic indemnification asset of million  proceeds from the sale of non covered other real estate owned of million  and proceeds from the sale of covered other real estate owned of million  partially offset by million of purchases of investment securities available for sale  net non covered loan originations of million and purchases of premises and equipment of million 
net cash of million used by financing activities primarily consisted of million decrease in deposits  net of increased deposit balances due to circle bancorp acquisition  million repayment of circle bancorp term debt  million of dividends paid on common stock  and million of common stock repurchased  partially offset by million increase in net securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
although we expect the bank and the company liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during  it is possible that our deposit growth for may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or  in order to generate deposit growth  our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits

the federal reserve board has in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank financial holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet

the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
our consolidated tier i capital  which consists of shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill  other intangible assets  disallowed servicing assets and disallowed deferred tax assets  totaled billion at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of  the allowance for loan and lease losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits 
the total of tier i capital plus tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was billion at december  the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  the tier and total risk based capital ratios at december  were and  respectively 

table of contents a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as period end shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  divided by average assets as adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated financial holding companies that are not undertaking significant expansion programs  the federal reserve board may require a financial holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and financial holding companies 
our consolidated leverage ratios at december  and were and  respectively 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the bank regulatory capital category 
during the year ended december   the company made no contributions to the bank 
at december   all three of the capital ratios of the bank exceeded the minimum ratios required by federal regulation 
management monitors these ratios on a regular basis to ensure that the bank remains within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
during  umpqua board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of per common share for the first quarter and per common share for the second  third and fourth quarters 
these dividends were made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of  among other things  earnings  regulatory capital levels  the overall payout ratio and expected asset growth 
we expect that the dividend rate will be reassessed on a quarterly basis by the board of directors in accordance with the dividend policy 
the payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the supervision and regulation section of part i of this report 
there is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased 
the following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share for the years ended december   and cash dividends and payout ratios per common share dividend declared per common share dividend payout ratio the company s share repurchase plan  which was first approved by the board and announced in august  was amended on september  to increase the number of common shares available for repurchase under the plan to million shares 
the repurchase program will run through june as of december   a total of million shares remained available for repurchase 
the company repurchased  shares under the repurchase plan in the timing and amount of future repurchases will depend upon the market price for our common stock  securities laws restricting repurchases  asset growth  earnings  and our capital plan

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk arises primarily from credit risk and interest rate risk inherent in our investment  lending and financing activities 
to manage our credit risk  we rely on various controls  including our underwriting standards and loan policies  internal loan monitoring and periodic credit reviews as well as our allowance of loan and lease losses alll methodology  all of which are administered by the bank s credit quality group or alll committee 
additionally  the bank s loan and investment committee provides board oversight over the company s loan and investment portfolio risk management functions  and the bank s audit and compliance committee provides board oversight of the alll process and reviews and approves the alll methodology 
interest rate risk is the potential for loss resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates on the company s net interest income 
the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
net interest income and the fair value of financial instruments are greatly influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
we manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies that are established by the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets monthly and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policy  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the board of directors loan and investment committee provides oversight of the asset liability management process  reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the alco and approves the asset liability policy on an annual basis 
we measure our interest rate risk position on at least a quarterly basis using three methods i gap analysis  ii net interest income simulation  and iii economic value of equity fair value of financial instruments modeling 
the results of these analyses are reviewed by alco and the loan and investment committee quarterly 
if hypothetical changes to interest rates cause changes to our simulated net interest income simulation or economic value of equity modeling outside of our pre established internal limits  we may adjust our asset and liability size or mix in our effort to bring our interest rate risk exposure within our established limits 
gap analysis a gap analysis provides information about the volume and repricing characteristics and relationship between the amounts of interest sensitive assets and interest bearing liabilities at a particular point in time 
an effective interest rate strategy attempts to match the volume of interest sensitive assets and interest bearing liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities at a point in time that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
the main focus of this interest rate management tool is the gap sensitivity identified as the cumulative one year gap 
the table below sets forth interest sensitivity gaps for these different intervals as of december  
table of contents interest sensitivity gap in thousands by repricing interval over non rate months months years years sensitive total assets interest bearing deposits temporary investments trading account assets securities held to maturity securities available for sale loans held for sale non covered loans and leases covered loans and leases non interest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase term debt junior subordinated debentures  at fair value junior subordinated debentures  at amortized cost non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a of earning assets the gap table has inherent limitations and actual results may vary significantly from the results suggested by the gap table 
the gap table is unable to incorporate certain balance sheet characteristics or factors 
the gap table assumes a static balance sheet and looks at the repricing of existing assets and liabilities without consideration of new loans and deposits that reflect a more current interest rate environment 
changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk and generally relates to the possibility that the repricing characteristics of short term assets tied to the prime rate are different from those of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
these prepayments may have a significant impact on our net interest margin 
for example  unlike the net interest income simulation  the interest rate risk profile of certain deposit products and floating rate loans that have reached their floors cannot be captured effectively in a gap table 
although the table shows the amount of certain assets and liabilities scheduled to reprice in a given time frame  it does not reflect when or to what extent such repricings may actually occur 
for example  interest bearing checking  money market and savings deposits are shown to reprice in the first three months  but we may choose to reprice these deposits more slowly and incorporate only a portion of the movement in market rates based on market conditions at that time 
alternatively  a loan which has reached its floor may not reprice even though market interest rates change causing such loan to act like a fixed rate loan regardless of its scheduled repricing date 
the gap table as presented cannot factor in the flexibility we believe we have in repricing deposits or the floors on our loans 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap analysis may not provide an accurate assessment of our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we believe the estimated effect of a change in interest rates is better reflected in our net interest income and market value of equity simulations 

table of contents net interest income simulation interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
this model is an interest rate risk management tool and the results are not necessarily an indication of our future net interest income 
this model has inherent limitations and these results are based on a given set of rate changes and assumptions at one point in time 
these estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including changes in the size or mix of the balance sheet  new volume rates for new balances  the rate of prepayments  and the correlation of pricing to changes in the interest rate environment 
for example  for interest bearing deposit balances we may choose to reprice these balances more slowly and incorporate only a portion of the movement in market rates based on market conditions at that time 
additionally  our primary analysis assumes a static balance sheet  both in terms of the total size and mix of our balance sheet  meaning cash flows from the maturity or repricing of assets and liabilities are redeployed in the same instrument at modeled rates 
changes that could vary significantly from our assumptions include loan and deposit growth or contraction  changes in the mix of our earning assets or funding sources  the performance of covered loans accounted for under the expected cash flow method  and future asset liability management decisions  all of which may have significant effects on our net interest income 
also  some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances will occur 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions management could undertake to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or the impact a change in interest rates may have on our credit risk profile  loan prepayment estimates and spread relationships  which can change regularly 
actions we could undertake include  but are not limited to  growing or contracting the balance sheet  changing the composition of the balance sheet  or changing our pricing strategies for loans or deposits 
the estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of december  is indicated in the table below 
for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
for example  the up basis points scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of basis points per month for twelve months applied to the balance sheet of december for each respective year 
interest rate simulation impact on net interest income as of december  dollars in thousands increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease in net interest in net interest in net interest income from percentage income from percentage income from percentage base scenario change base scenario change base scenario change up basis points up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points asset sensitivity indicates that in a rising interest rate environment a company s net interest margin would increase and in decreasing interest rate environment a company s net interest margin would decrease 
liability sensitivity indicates that in a rising interest rate environment a company s net interest margin would decrease and in a decreasing interest rate environment a company s net interest margin would increase 
for all years presented  we were asset sensitive in both increased and decreased market interest rate scenarios 
the relative level of asset sensitivity as of december  has increased for all scenarios compared to december   and has marginally increased for most periods compared to december  in general  we view the net interest income model results as more relevant to the company s current operating profile a going concern  and we primarily manage our balance sheet based on this information 

table of contents economic value of equity another interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
this approach provides a longer term view of interest rate risk  capturing all future expected cash flows 
assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques 
the projections are by their nature forward looking and therefore inherently uncertain  and include various assumptions regarding cash flows and discount rates 
the table below illustrates the effects of various instantaneous market interest rate changes on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities excluding mortgage servicing rights as compared to the corresponding carrying values and fair values interest rate simulation impact on fair value of financial assets and liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands increase increase in decrease in estimated fair percentage estimated fair percentage value of equity change value of equity change up basis points up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points as of december   our economic value of equity model indicates an asset sensitive profile in increasing interest rate environments and a liability sensitive profile  in decreasing interest rate environments 
this suggests a sudden or sustained increase in increasing or decreasing interest rate scenarios would result in an increase in our estimated market value of equity 
consistent with the results in the interest rate simulation impact on net interest income  our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes as of december  has increased compared to december  as of december   our estimated economic value of equity fair value of financial assets and liabilities exceeded our book value of equity 
this result is primarily based on the value placed on the company s significant amount of noninterest bearing and low interest bearing deposits and fixed rates or floors characteristics included in the company s loan portfolio 
while noninterest bearing deposits do not impact the net interest income simulation  the value of these deposits has a significant impact on the economic value of equity model  particularly when market rates are assumed to rise 
impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
we believe that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on management ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
we have an asset liability management program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
our financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  occupancy and business development expenses 
in management opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions
