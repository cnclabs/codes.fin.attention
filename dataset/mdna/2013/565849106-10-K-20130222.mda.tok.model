environmental  health and safety matters the health  environmental  safety and corporate responsibility committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues  including environmental  health and safety matters 
our corporate health  environment  safety and security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs 
we also have a corporate emergency response team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties 
our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  health and safety 
these laws and regulations include the occupational safety and health act osha with respect to the protection of health and safety of employees  the clean air act caa with respect to air emissions  the federal water pollution control act also known as the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances  the oil pollution act of opa with respect to oil pollution and response  the national environmental policy act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts  the endangered species act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal and the us emergency planning and community right to know act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories 
in addition  many other states and countries in which where we operate have their own laws dealing with similar matters 
these laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances  including crude oil  into the environment  or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal 
in some cases  these laws can impose liability for the entire cost of clean up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others such as prior owners or operators of our assets or conditions others have caused  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 
new laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined 
based on regulatory trends  particularly with respect to the caa and its implementing regulations  we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations 
however  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities  marketing areas and production processes

air in august  the us epa published final new source performance standards nsps and national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that amended existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities as well as created a new nsps for oil and gas production  transmission and distribution facilities 
these rules have been challenged  and negotiations with the us epa over proposed changes to the rules continue 
compliance with these new rules will result in an increase in the costs of control equipment and labor and require additional notification  monitoring  reporting and recordkeeping for some of our facilities 
the us epa was also notified in december that seven northeastern states intend to sue the us epa for failure to include methane standards in these rules 
if successfully challenged  the addition of methane standards could further increase our costs to comply with this rule 
in july  the us epa finalized a federal implementation plan under the caa that includes new source review nsr regulations which apply to air emissions sources on tribal lands 
this rule became effective on august   and requires the registration and or pre construction permitting of most of our facilities on tribal lands in wyoming  oklahoma and north dakota 
rather than issue pre construction permits for our facilities on tribal lands in north dakota  in august of  the us epa finalized an interim final rule under the caa that requires certain control equipment  recordkeeping  monitoring  and reporting with respect to these facilities 
compliance with this new rule will result in an increase in the costs of control  equipment and labor and will require additional notification  monitoring  reporting and recordkeeping for our facilities on tribal lands in north dakota 
climate change in  the us epa promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions 
our first reports made pursuant to this rule were submitted in september further  state  national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated 
these requirements apply or could apply in countries in which we operate 
potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations 
the cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time 
for additional information  see item a 
risk factors 
as part of our commitment to environmental stewardship  we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations 
we are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates 
in addition  we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective 
hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water  sand  and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore 
hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state level through permitting and compliance requirements 
state level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices  limit water withdrawals and water use  require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents  restrict which additives may be used  or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing 
in addition  the us congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process 
in the first quarter of  the us epa announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
the us epa has issued an interim report in late  and expects to issue a final report in increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques 
additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays  or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 
the adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs  which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells 
remediation the aosp operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open pit mine  extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils 
tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds 
the aosp is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work 
the reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan 
the aosp continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate alternate tailings management technologies 
in february  the ercb issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings 
we believe that we are substantially in compliance with the directive at this time 
we could incur additional costs if further new regulations are issued or if we fail to comply in a timely manner 
concentrations of credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties  a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy related industries 
the creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review  including the use of master netting agreements  where appropriate 
for the year  sales to statoil and to shell oil and its affiliates each accounted for more than percent of our annual revenues 
for the years and  transactions with mpc accounted for more than percent of our annual revenues 
the majority of those transactions occurred while mpc was a wholly owned subsidiary 
in addition  sales of crude oil and natural gas produced in libya to the libyan national oil company accounted for more than percent of our annual revenues 
trademarks  patents and licenses we currently hold a number of us and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications 
although in the aggregate our trademarks  patents and licenses are important to us  we do not regard any single trademark  patent  license or group of related trademarks  patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole 
employees we had  active  full time employees as of december  we consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
we have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees

item a 
risk factors we are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business 
the following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
when considering an investment in our securities  you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in the foregoing pages under disclosures regarding forward looking statements and other information included and incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k 
a substantial  extended decline in liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas prices would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets 
prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas fluctuate widely 
our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we receive for our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas 
historically  the markets for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
many of the factors influencing prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are beyond our control 
these factors include worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  developing and producing liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  the ability of the members of opec to agree to and maintain production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions  changes in weather patterns and climate  natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornadoes  the price and availability of alternative and competing forms of energy  the effect of conservation efforts  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and general economic conditions worldwide 
the long term effects of these and other factors on the prices of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are uncertain 
lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices may cause us to reduce the amount of these commodities that we produce  which may reduce our revenues  operating income and cash flows 
significant reductions in liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures or impair the carrying value of our assets 
our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us 
offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment 
activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers 
environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities 
estimates of liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves depend on many factors and assumptions  including various assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the estimates 
any material changes in those conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity and value of our liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves 
the proved reserve information included in this annual report on form k has been derived from engineering estimates 
estimates of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves were prepared by our in house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals and were reviewed and approved by our corporate reserves group 
the synthetic crude oil reserves estimates were prepared by glj petroleum consultants  a third party consulting firm experienced in working with oil sands 
reserves were valued based on the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the month periods ended december   and  as well as other conditions in existence at those dates 
any significant future price change will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves 
future reserve revisions could also result from changes in governmental regulation  among other things 
reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of liquid hydrocarbons  natural gas and bitumen that cannot be directly measured 
bitumen is mined and then upgraded into synthetic crude oil 
estimates of economically producible reserves and of future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions  including location  size and shape of the accumulation as well as fluid  rock and producing characteristics of the accumulation  historical production from the area  compared with production from other comparable producing areas  volumes of bitumen in place and various factors affecting the recoverability of bitumen and its conversion into synthetic crude oil such as historical upgrader performance  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and repair costs  and industry economic conditions  levels of cash flows from operations and other operating considerations 
as a result  different petroleum engineers  each using industry accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific methods  may produce different estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows based on the same available data 
because of the subjective nature of such reserve estimates  each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated the amount and timing of production  the revenues and costs associated with that production  and the amount and timing of future development expenditures 
the discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves reflected in this annual report on form k should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by sec rule of regulation s x  the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved liquid hydrocarbon  natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are based on an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the month periods ended december   and  and costs applicable at the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
in addition  the percent discount factor required by the applicable rules of the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the oil and natural gas industry in general 
if we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves  our future liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production would decline  thereby reducing our cash flows and results of operations and impairing our financial condition 
the rate of production from liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent we acquire interests in additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful exploration and development activities or  through engineering studies  optimize production performance or identify additional reservoirs not currently producing or secondary recovery reserves  our proved reserves will decline materially as liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas are produced 
accordingly  to the extent we are not successful in replacing the liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas we produce  our future revenues will decline 
creating and maintaining an inventory of prospects for future production depends on many factors  including obtaining rights to explore for  develop and produce liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in promising areas  drilling success  the ability to complete long lead time  capital intensive projects timely and on budget  the ability to find or acquire additional proved reserves at acceptable costs  and the ability to fund such activity 
future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and involve substantial costs 
drilling for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reservoirs 
the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  fires  explosions  blowouts and surface cratering  lack of access to pipelines or other transportation methods  and shortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of equipment 
if we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and in a timely manner  or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
delays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering  procurement and construction of facilities including improvements and repairs to our existing facilities could adversely affect our ability to achieve forecasted internal rates of return and operating results 
delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we produce 
such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors  many of which are beyond our control  including denial of or delay in receiving requisite regulatory approvals and or permits  unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor  disruptions in transportation of components or construction materials  increased costs or operational delays resulting from shortages of water  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters or other events such as equipment malfunctions  explosions  fires or spills affecting our facilities  or those of vendors or suppliers  shortages of sufficiently skilled labor  or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages  market related increases in a project s debt or equity financing costs  and nonperformance by  or disputes with  vendors  suppliers  contractors or subcontractors 
any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our ongoing capital projects 
we may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with  and changes in environmental health  safety and security laws and regulations  and  as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
our businesses are subject to numerous laws  regulations and other requirements relating to the protection of the environment  including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment such as the venting or flaring of natural gas  waste management  pollution prevention  greenhouse gas emissions  the protection of endangered species as well as laws  regulations  and other requirements relating to public and employee safety and health and to facility security 
we have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws  regulations  and other requirements 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products  our operating results will be adversely affected 
the specific impact of these laws  regulations  and other requirements may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of operating facilities and production processes 
we may also be required to make material expenditures to modify operations  install pollution control equipment  perform site cleanups or curtail operations that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may become subject to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate in connection with new  amended or more stringent requirements  stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination 
in addition  any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws  regulations  and other requirements could result in civil penalties or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us 
we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent  causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue  with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations 
currently  various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of review  discussion or implementation in countries where we operate  including the us  canada  and norway  and the european union 
our operations result in these greenhouse gas emissions 
through  domestic legislative and regulatory efforts included proposed federal legislation and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs  each of which could impose reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
further  in december at the doha climate change conference  countries agreed to extend the kyoto protocol to however  the us senate has not ratified the kyoto protocol  nor is it clear whether the us senate plans to ratify this agreement in the future 
if the us does ratify the kyoto protocol in the future or sign a new international agreement  such actions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities  capital expenditures to install new emission controls at our facilities  and costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions or carbon trading or tax programs 
these costs and capital expenditures could be material 
although uncertain  these developments could increase our costs  reduce the demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  and create delays in our obtaining air pollution permits for new or modified facilities 
although there may be adverse financial impact including compliance costs  potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for liquid hydrocarbons or natural gas associated with any legislation  regulation  or other action by the us epa  the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented 
private party litigation has also been brought against some emitters of greenhouse gas emissions 
the potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells 
hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water  sand  and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore 
the us congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process 
consideration of new federal regulation and increased state oversight continues to arise 
the us epa announced in the first quarter of its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
the us epa has issued an interim report in late  and expects to issue a final report in in addition  various state level initiatives in regions with substantial shale gas resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices  limit water withdrawals and water use  require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents  restrict which additives may be used  or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing 
increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition  including litigation  to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques 
additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  including from the developing shale plays  or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing 
the adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells 
worldwide political and economic developments and changes in law could adversely affect our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows 
local political and economic factors in global markets could have a material adverse effect on us 
a total of percent of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in was derived from production outside the us and percent of our proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves as of december  were located outside the us all of our synthetic crude oil production and proved reserves are located in canada 
we are  therefore  subject to the political  geographic and economic risks and possible terrorist activities attendant to doing business with suppliers located within or outside of the us there are many risks associated with operations in countries and in global markets  such as eg  ethiopia  gabon  kenya  the kurdistan region of iraq and libya  including changes in governmental policies relating to liquid hydrocarbon or natural gas and taxation  other political  economic or diplomatic developments and international monetary fluctuations  political and economic instability  war  acts of terrorism and civil disturbances  the possibility that a government may seize our property with or without compensation  may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements or may impose additional taxes or royalty burdens  and fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages and currency controls 
since january  there have been varying degrees of political instability and public protests  including demonstrations which have been marked by violence  within some countries in the middle east including bahrain  egypt  iraq  libya  syria  tunisia and yemen 
some political regimes in these countries are threatened or have changed as a result of such unrest 
if such unrest continues to spread  conflicts could result in civil wars  regional conflicts  and regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the us these may have the following results  among others volatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy  resulting in slower economic growth rates and reduced demand for our products  negative impact on the world crude oil supply if transportation avenues are disrupted  security concerns leading to the prolonged evacuation of our personnel  damage to  or the inability to access  production facilities or other operating assets  and inability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations 
continued hostilities in the middle east and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could adversely affect the economies of the us and other developed countries 
a lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption  which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects 
these risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas 
in addition  these risks could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets and make it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate 
actions of governments through tax legislation and other changes in law  executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability  both in the us and abroad 
the us government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries 
these restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in  or gain access to  opportunities in various countries and will continue to do so in the future 
changes in law could also adversely affect our results  such as the adoption of government payment transparency regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause us to violate the non disclosure laws of other countries 
our commodity price risk management and trading activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from commodity price increases and may expose us to other risks  including counterparty risk 
to the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines  we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the derivative instruments used to manage price risk 
in addition  our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our business could be negatively impacted by cyber attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure 
computers and telecommunication devices are integrated into our business operations and are used as a part of our liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production and distribution systems in the us and abroad  including those systems which are utilized to transport our production to market 
a cyber attack impacting these computers and telecommunication devices  or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely  could damage critical production  distribution and or storage assets  delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions 
although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk  cyber attacks are evolving and unpredictable 
these attacks could include  but are not limited to  malicious software  attempts to gain unauthorized access to data  other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems  the unauthorized release of protected information and the corruption or loss of data 
the occurrence of such an attack could lead to financial losses and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our operations may be adversely affected by pipeline and midstream capacity constraints 
the marketability of our production depends in part on the availability  proximity  and capacity of pipeline facilities  railcars and tanker transportation 
if any pipelines  railcars or tankers become unavailable  we would  to the extent possible  be required to find a suitable alternative to transport our liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas  which could increase the costs and or reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of our production 
if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties  our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems  to accurately estimate reserves  production rates or costs  or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we typically seek the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties 
although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is diligent and consistent with industry practices  reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess possible deficiencies and potential problems 
even when problems with a property are identified  we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements 
moreover  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as previously discussed  actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties 
actual reserves  production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates 
in addition  an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations  particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  and many of our competitors are larger and have available resources in excess of our own 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive  and many competitors  including major integrated and independent oil and gas companies  as well as national oil companies  are larger and have substantially greater resources at their disposal than we do 
we compete with these companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties 
we also compete with these companies for equipment and personnel  including petroleum engineers  geologists  geophysicists and other specialists  required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end users 
such competition can significantly increase costs and affect the availability of resources  which could provide our larger competitors a competitive advantage when acquiring equipment  leases and other properties 
they may also be able to use their greater resources to attract and retain experienced personnel 
many of our major projects and operations are conducted with partners  which may decrease our ability to manage risk 
we often enter into arrangements to conduct certain business operations  such oil and gas exploration and production  oil sands mining or pipeline transportation  with partners in order to share risks associated with those operations 
however  these arrangements also may decrease our ability to manage risks and costs  particularly where we are not the operator 
we could have limited influence over and control of the behaviors and performance of these operations 
in addition  misconduct  fraud  noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or improper activities by or on behalf of one or more of our partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation 
our operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses 
we do not insure against all potential losses and therefore we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities and increased costs 
our e p operations are subject to unplanned occurrences  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  spills  hurricanes and other adverse weather  tsunamis  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions or nuclear or other disasters  labor disputes and accidents 
our osm operations are subject to business interruptions due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and unplanned events such as fires  earthquakes  explosions or other interruptions 
these same risks can be applied to the third parties which transport crude oil from our facilities 
a prolonged disruption in the ability of any pipeline or vessels to transport crude oil could contribute to a business interruption or increase costs 
our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
these hazards could result in serious personal injury or loss of human life  significant damage to property and equipment  environmental pollution  impairment of operations and substantial losses to us 
various hazards have adversely affected us in the past  and damages resulting from a catastrophic occurrence in the future involving us or any of our assets or operations may result in our being named as a defendant in one or more lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or in our being assessed potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities 
we maintain insurance against many  but not all  potential losses or liabilities arising from operating hazards in amounts that we believe to be prudent 
uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could reduce the funds available to us for capital  exploration and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
historically  we have maintained insurance coverage for physical damage and resulting business interruption to our major onshore and offshore facilities  with significant self insured retentions 
in the future  we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased substantially and could escalate further 
in some instances  certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  due to hurricane activity in recent years  the availability of insurance coverage for our offshore facilities for windstorms in the gulf of mexico region has been reduced or  in many instances  it is prohibitively expensive 
as a result  our exposure to losses from future windstorm activity in the gulf of mexico region has increased 
litigation by private plaintiffs or government officials could adversely affect our performance 
we currently are defending litigation and anticipate that we will be required to defend new litigation in the future 
the subject matter of such litigation may include releases of hazardous substances from our facilities  privacy laws  antitrust laws or any other laws or regulations that apply to our operations 
in some cases the plaintiff or plaintiffs seek alleged damages involving large classes of potential litigants  and may allege damages relating to extended periods of time or other alleged facts and circumstances 
if we are not able to successfully defend such claims  they may result in substantial liability 
we do not have insurance covering all of these potential liabilities 
in addition to substantial liability  litigation may also seek injunctive relief which could have an adverse effect on our future operations 
in connection with our separation from mpc  mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities 
however  there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities  or that mpc s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations will not be impaired in the future 
pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin off  mpc agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities 
however  third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that mpc agreed to retain or assume  and there can be no assurance that the indemnification from mpc will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities  or that mpc will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations 
in addition  even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from mpc any amounts for which we are held liable  we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 
the spin off could result in substantial tax liability 
we obtained a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin off qualified as tax free to mpc  us and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections and and related provisions of the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
if the factual assumptions or representations made in the request for the private letter ruling prove to have been inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect  then we will not be able to rely on the ruling 
furthermore  the irs does not rule on whether a distribution such as the spin off satisfies certain requirements necessary to obtain tax free treatment under section of the code 
rather  the private letter ruling was based on representations by us that those requirements were satisfied  and any inaccuracy in those representations could invalidate the ruling 
in connection with the spin off  we also obtained an opinion of outside counsel  substantially to the effect that  the distribution of shares of mpc common stock in the spin off qualified as tax free to mpc  us and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes under sections and and related provisions of the code 
the opinion relied on  among other things  the continuing validity of the private letter ruling and various assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by mpc and us which  if inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect  would jeopardize the conclusions reached by such counsel in its opinion 
the opinion is not binding on the irs or the courts  and there can be no assurance that the irs or the courts would not challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion or that any such challenge would not prevail 
if  notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling and opinion of counsel  the spin off were determined not to qualify under section of the code  each us holder of our common stock who received shares of mpc common stock in the spin off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of mpc common stock received 
that distribution would be taxable to each such stockholder as a dividend to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits as of the effective date of the spin off 
for each such stockholder  any amount that exceeded those earnings and profits would be treated first as a non taxable return of capital to the extent of such stockholder s tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain 
we would be subject to tax as if we had sold all the outstanding shares of mpc common stock in a taxable sale for their fair market value and would recognize taxable gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares over our tax basis in such shares 
under the terms of the tax sharing agreement we entered into with mpc in connection with the spin off  mpc is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on mpc or us and our subsidiaries in the event that the spin off and or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax free treatment as a result of actions taken  or breaches of representations and warranties made in the tax sharing agreement  by mpc or any of its affiliates 
however  if the spin off and or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify for tax free treatment because of actions or failures to act by us or any of our affiliates  we would be responsible for all such taxes 
we may issue preferred stock whose terms could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue  without the approval of our stockholders  one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences  powers and relative  participating  optional and other rights  including preferences over marathon oil common stock respecting dividends and distributions  as our board of directors generally may determine 
the terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of marathon oil common stock 
for example  we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions 
similarly  the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock
