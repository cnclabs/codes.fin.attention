in march  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of celestial semiconductor  ltd 
with the acquisition of celestial semiconductor  we have added capabilities to enable a processor family targeted for the large and growing market of converged media  gateway and wireless display applications 
for a more detailed discussions on our most recent acquisitions  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report  incorporated herein by reference 
since inception  we have invested heavily in new product development and our net revenue has grown from million in to million in driven primarily by demand in the enterprise network and data center markets and increased demand in the broadband and consumer markets 
we expect sales of our products for use in the enterprise network and data center markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future  however  we do expect growth in the broadband and consumer as well as the access and servicer provider markets 

table of contents we primarily sell our products to oems  either directly or through their contract manufacturers 
contract manufacturers purchase our products only when an oem incorporates our product into the oem s product  not as commercial off the shelf products 
our customers products are complex and require significant time to define  design and ramp to volume production 
accordingly  our sales cycle is long 
this cycle begins with our technical marketing  sales and field application engineers engaging with our customers system designers and management  which is typically a multi month process 
if we are successful  a customer will decide to incorporate our product in its product  which we refer to as a design win 
because the sales cycles for our products are long  we incur expenses to develop and sell our products  regardless of whether we achieve the design win and well in advance of generating revenue  if any  from those expenditures 
we do not have long term purchase commitments from any of our customers  as sales of our products are generally made under individual purchase orders 
however  once one of our products is incorporated into a customer s design  it is likely to remain designed in for the life cycle of the product 
we believe this to be the case because a redesign would generally be time consuming and expensive 
we have experienced revenue growth due to an increase in the number of our products  an expansion of our customer base  an increase in the number of average design wins within any one customer and an increase in the average revenue per design win 
our revenue from montavista is mainly from sale of software subscriptions of embedded linux operating system  related development tools  support and professional services 
the net revenue for our software and services are primarily derived from the sale of time based software licenses  software maintenance and support  and from professional services arrangements and training 
key business metrics design wins 
we closely monitor design wins by customer and end market on a periodic basis 
we consider design wins to be a key ingredient in our future success  although the revenue generated by each design win can vary significantly 
our long term sales expectations are based on internal forecasts from specific customer design wins based upon the expected time to market for end customer products deploying our products and associated revenue potential 
pricing and margins 
pricing and margins depend on the features of the products we provide to our customers 
in general  products with more complex configurations and higher performance tend to be priced higher and have higher gross margins 
these configurations tend to be used in high performance applications that are focused on the enterprise network  data center  and access and service provider markets 
we tend to experience price decreases over the life cycle of our products  which can vary by market and application 
in general  we experience less pricing volatility with customers that sell to the enterprise and data center markets 
sales volume 
a typical design win can generate a wide range of sales volumes for our products  depending on the end market demand for our customers products 
this can depend on several factors  including the reputation  market penetration  the size of the end market that the product addresses  and the marketing and sales effectiveness of our customer 
in general  our customers with greater market penetration and better branding tend to develop products that generate larger volumes over the product life cycle 
in addition  some markets generate large volumes if the end market product is adopted by the mass market 
customer product life cycle 
we typically commence commercial shipments from nine months to three years following a design win 
once our product is in production  revenue from a particular customer may continue for several years 
we estimate our customers product life cycles based on the customer  type of product and end market 
in general  products that go into the enterprise network and data center take longer to reach volume production but tend to have longer lives 
products for other markets  such as broadband and consumer  tend to ramp relatively quickly  but generally have shorter life cycles 
we estimate these life cycles based on our management s experience with providers of networking equipment and the semiconductor market as a whole 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters that may affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if the changes in estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes  mask costs  business combinations  and goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from sales of semiconductor products and sales of software licenses and services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of a binding arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  iii the price is deemed fixed and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our price is considered fixed or determinable at the execution of an agreement  based on specific products and quantities to be delivered at specified prices  which is often memorialized with a customer purchase order 
our agreements with non distributor customers do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness and any past transaction history of the customers 
we include shipping charges billed to customers in product revenue and include the related shipping costs in cost of revenue 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment to our customers 
revenue from the sales of semiconductor products consists of sales of our products for a new design usually made directly to networking original equipment manufacturers  or oems  their contract manufacturers or distributors 
once their design enters production  they often outsource their manufacturing and their contract manufacturers purchase our products directly from us or from our distributors 

table of contents we recognize revenue upon shipment for product sales to distributors with limited rights of returns and price protection if we conclude we can reasonably estimate the credits for returns and price adjustments issuable 
we record an estimated allowance  at the time of shipment  based on our historical patterns of returns and pricing credits of sales recognized upon shipment 
the credits issued to distributors or other customers have historically not been material 
the inventory at these distributors at end of the period may fluctuate from time to time mainly due to the oem production ramps or new customer demands 
we defer revenue and costs relating to product sales to distributors if we grant more than limited rights of returns and price credits or if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of returns and credits issuable 
deferred revenue  net of deferred cost on these shipments is reported as part of deferred revenue  accounts receivable is recognized and inventory is relieved when the title to inventories are transferred  which typically takes place at the time of shipment  which is the point in time at which we have a legal enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms 
we also derive revenue from licensing software and providing software maintenance and support 
software arrangements typically include i an end user license fee paid in exchange for the use of our products for a specified period of time  generally months time based license  and ii a support arrangement that provides for technical support and unspecified product updates and upgrades on a when and if available basis over the period of the related license 
we record revenue from software and service arrangements when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require either a written contract signed by both the customer and us  or a shrink wrap or click through contract whereby the customer agrees to our standard license terms  together with a non cancellable purchase order  or a purchase order from these customers that have previously negotiated an end user license arrangement or volume purchase arrangement 
delivery has occurred we deliver software to our customers electronically and consider delivery to have occurred once the access codes are provided that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software 
the fee is fixed or determinable our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
collectibility is reasonably assured we assess the collectibility of an arrangement on a case by case basis  based on the financial condition of the customer as well as any established payment history 
for multiple element arrangements entered into prior to the adoption of the amended guidance on multiple delivery arrangements effective january   which contain software or software related elements  we allocate revenue between elements in a multiple element revenue arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for each undelivered element 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
we enter into multiple element arrangements that generally include time based licenses and support that are typically not sold separately 
we defer and recognize revenue from these arrangements ratably over the term that support is offered  which is typically months 
the software arrangement may also include professional services  and these services may be purchased separately 
we bill professional services engagements on either a fixed fee or time and materials basis 
for fixed fee arrangements  we recognize professional services revenue under the proportional performance method  with the associated costs included in cost of revenue 
we estimate the proportional performance of the arrangements based on an analysis of progress toward completion 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate  and a loss is recognized when the total estimated project cost exceeds project revenue 
if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue 
table of contents recognized  we record the excess amount as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on progress toward completion of projects in progress 
to the extent we are unable to estimate the proportional performance then we recognize the revenue on a completed performance basis 
we recognize revenue for time and materials engagements as the effort is incurred 
in addition  we also enter into multiple element arrangements  which consist of the combination of licensed software  support and professional services 
professional services in these arrangements do not involve significant customization  modification or development of software licensed under the time based licenses and are not essential to the functionality of these software 
provided that the total arrangement consideration is fixed and determinable at the inception of the arrangement  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to professional services and time based licenses bundled with support based on vsoe for professional services and vsoe for time based licenses bundled with support 
we account for each unit of accounting under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize the license and related service revenues using the proportional performance method 
if we are unable to establish vsoe for each undelivered element of the arrangement  we defer revenue for the entire arrangement until the time that we are able to establish vsoe for the undelivered elements or there is only one remaining undelivered element 
when the revenue is deferred  we defer the direct costs incurred in relation to the professional services arrangement and record the direct costs as deferred costs in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
effective january   we adopted the updated guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
for transactions entered into subsequent to the adoption of this updated guidance  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements with combinations of hardware  software  post contract support and or professional services  and if the different elements in the arrangement qualify as separate units of accounting  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each element based on relative selling price 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available  third party evidence  or tpe  if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price  or esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for products and services revenue recognition 
vsoe of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
tpe is determined by evaluating competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our product offerings related to these arrangements contain a significant level of customization and contain a significant portion of proprietary technology which is not exactly comparable to its peers  therefore pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained  and thus we cannot determine tpe 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis 
the esp is determined by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels  gross margin objectives  internal costs  competitor pricing strategies  and industry technology lifecycles 
the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation we apply the fair value recognition provisions of stock based compensation 
the stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate over the vesting period 
we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  which require various subjective assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term and the risk free interest rates 
for options granted prior to  we based the expected volatility of common stock at the date of grant on reported market value data of a group of publicly traded companies  which were selected from certain market indices  that we believed was relatively comparable after consideration of their size  stage of life cycle  profitability  growth  and risk and return of 
table of contents investments 
further  we estimated the expected term using the simplified method as permitted by the provisions on stock based compensation 
since our stock has been publicly traded since may  we deemed that we have sufficient trading history to use the historical volatility for option grants beginning in the first quarter of the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates and judgment 
inventory valuation inventory is carried at cost except where we make provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on its age and forecasted demand  generally over a month period 
demand is impacted by market and economic conditions  technology changes  new product introductions and changes in strategic direction and require management to make estimates that may include uncertain elements 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 
as of december   we assessed that it is more likely than not that we will not realize our federal and state deferred tax assets based on the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in our united states tax jurisdiction to realize the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets 
see results of operations below for a more detailed discussion 
mask costs we incur costs for the fabrication of masks used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture wafers that incorporate our products 
we capitalize the costs of fabrication masks that are reasonably expected to be used during production manufacturing 
these amounts are included within property and equipment and are generally depreciated over a period of months to cost of revenue 
if we do not reasonably expect to use the fabrication mask during production manufacturing  we expense the related mask costs to research and development in the period in which the costs are incurred 
business combinations we account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
we determine the recognition of intangible assets based on the following criteria i the intangible asset arises from contractual or other rights  or ii the intangible is separable or divisible from the acquired entity and capable of being sold  transferred  licensed  returned or exchanged 
in accordance with the guidance provided under business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of business combinations to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  or ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
management makes valuation assumptions that require significant estimates  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets includes future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  and distribution agreements and acquired developed technologies  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products  estimated cash flows from projects when completed and discount rates 
other 
table of contents estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we expense acquisition related costs  including advisory  legal  accounting  valuation and other costs  in the periods in which the costs are incurred 
the results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the calendar year or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
we perform qualitative assessment to determine if any events have occurred or circumstances exist that would indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the qualitative factors include  but are not limited to a macroeconomic conditions  b industry and market considerations  c overall financial performance  d a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  e an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  f relevant entity specific events including changes in management  strategy or customers  g a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof  or h sustained decrease in share price 
if any indicators exist based on the qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  we use a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  we perform the second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and record an impairment loss for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
determining the fair value of each reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions 
we generally use two approaches to value our reporting units  the income approach and the market approach 
we base the income approach on discounted cash flows which were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value under the income approach include the cash flow period  terminal values based on a terminal growth rate and the discount rate 
the market approach utilized valuation multiples based on operating and valuation metrics from comparable companies in the industry 
certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and with developing revenue models which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
in addition to the goodwill impairment  we also perform an impairment review of finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may not be fully recoverable 
whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of the finite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable  we estimate the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group from its use or eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets or asset group  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in the grouping of assets and forecasts of future operating results that are used in the impairment analysis 
during the year ended december   the company recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges related to its software and services reporting unit of million and million  respectively 
see results of operations below for a more detailed discussion on goodwill impairment 
the intangible 
table of contents impairment charge resulted from the decline in the fair value of certain acquired intangible assets primarily attributable to the decline in forecasted revenue for our software and services reporting unit 
results of operations our revenue  cost of revenue  gross profit and gross margin for the years ended december   and  were year ended december  in thousands net revenue cost of revenue gross profit gross margin net revenue 
our net revenue consists primarily of sales of our semiconductor products to providers of networking equipment and their contract manufacturers and distributors 
initial sales of our products for a new design are usually made directly to providers of networking equipment as they design and develop their product 
once their design enters production  they often outsource their manufacturing to contract manufacturers that purchase our products directly from us or from our distributors 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and periodically reduce the price of our products  as market and competitive conditions change  and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
we do not experience different margins on direct sales to providers of networking equipment and indirect sales through contract manufacturers because in all cases we negotiate product pricing directly with the providers of networking equipment 
to date  most of our revenue has been denominated in us dollars 
cisco systems  inc accounted for  and of net revenue in  and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues in  and revenue and costs relating to sales to distributors are deferred if we grant more than limited rights of returns and price credits or if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of returns and credits issuable 
we have an existing agreement with a distributor to distribute our products primarily in the united states 
given the terms of the distribution agreement  for sales to this distributor  we defer revenue and costs until products are sold to its end customers 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our net revenues were from products sold by this distributor 
revenue recognition depends on notification from this distributor that product has been sold to its end customers 
we use our distributors  other than the distributor discussed above  primarily to support international sale logistics in asia  including importation and credit management 
total net revenue through these distributors was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which accounted for  and of net revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the inventory at these distributors at the end of the period may fluctuate from time to time mainly due to the oem production ramps or new customer demands 
while we have purchase agreements with our distributors  the distributors do not have long term contracts with any of the equipment providers 
our distributor agreements limit the distributor s ability to return product up to a portion of purchases in the preceding quarter 
given our experience  along with our distributors limited contractual return rights  we believe we can reasonably estimate expected returns from our distributors 
accordingly  we recognize sales through distributors at the time of shipment  reduced by our estimate of expected returns 

table of contents revenue derived from licensing software and providing software maintenance  support and training amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue from professional service arrangements amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table is based on the geographic location of the original equipment manufacturers or the distributors that purchased our products 
for sales to our distributors  their geographic location may be different from the geographic locations of the ultimate end customers 
sales by geography for the periods indicated were year ended december  in thousands united states china taiwan japan malaysia korea other countries total cost of revenue and gross margin 
we outsource wafer fabrication  assembly and test functions of our products 
a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for assembly and test services  amortization of acquired intangibles and amortization related to capitalized mask costs 
to a lesser extent  cost of revenue includes expenses relating to our internal operations that manage our contractors  stock based compensation  the cost of shipping and logistics  royalties  inventory valuation expenses for excess and obsolete inventories  warranty costs and changes in product cost due to changes in sort  assembly and test yields 
in general  our cost of revenue associated with a particular product declines over time as a result of yield improvements  primarily associated with design and test enhancements 
we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors  which are primarily located in asia  to manufacture  assemble and test our semiconductor products 
we purchase processed wafers on a per wafer basis from our fabrication suppliers  which are currently taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  with the remaining manufacturing outsourced to samsung electronics  or samsung and fujitsu microelectronics  or fujitsu 
we also outsource the sort  assembly  final testing and other processing of our product to third party contractors  primarily ase electronics in taiwan  malaysia and singapore  as well as ise labs  inc  in the united states 
we negotiate wafer fabrication on a purchase order basis 
there are no long term agreements with any of these third party contractors 
a significant disruption in the operations of one or more of these third party contractors would impact the production of our products for a substantial period of time  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
cost of revenue also includes amortized costs of certain identifiable intangible assets from our business acquisitions to the extent those identifiable intangible assets are directly associated with cost of revenue 
the total amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from business acquisitions included in cost of revenue was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also incur costs for the fabrication of masks used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture wafers that incorporate our products 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of mask costs 
as our product processes continue to mature and as we develop more history and experience  we expect to capitalize most or all of our mask costs in the 
table of contents future 
we amortize the cost of fabrication masks that we reasonably expect to use for production manufacturing generally over a month period 
total amortized expenses for the masks included in cost of revenue were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the unamortized balance of capitalized mask costs at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the product mix  average sales prices of our products  the amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets  the timing of cost reductions for fabricated wafers and assembly and test service costs  inventory valuation charges  the cost of fabrication masks that are capitalized and amortized  and the timing and changes in sort  assembly and test yields 
overall gross margin is impacted by the mix between higher performance  higher margin products and services and lower performance  lower margin products and services 
in addition  we typically experience lower yields and higher associated costs on new products  which improve as production volumes increase 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs  engineering design development software and hardware tools  allocated facilities expenses and depreciation of equipment used in research and development and stock based compensation 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in total dollars to support the development of new products and improvement of existing products 
additionally  as a percentage of revenue  these costs fluctuate from one period to another 
total research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  was year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses percent of total net revenue sales  general and administrative expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel costs  accounting and legal fees  information systems  sales commissions  trade shows  marketing programs  depreciation  allocated facilities expenses and stock based compensation

our net revenue in decreased by million or compared to the decrease in net revenue in was attributable mainly to the decrease in our software and services of million  from our broadband and consumer market of million  and from our enterprise network  data center  and access and service provider markets  combined of million 
the decrease in net revenue from our software and services was driven by the decrease in subscription license renewals due to the timing of release of new version of licensed software and the decrease in the rate of execution of new professional service contracts as well as the timing of completion of existing large professional service agreements 
the overall decrease in sales in our enterprise networks  data center  and access and service provider markets as well as our broadband and consumer markets was mainly due to the decline in demand for our products from our top customers  as a result of the timing of these customers volume production of our design wins 
in addition  delays in some of our product launches contributed to the decline in our overall product sales 
cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of revenue decreased in by million or compared to primarily due to the decrease in net revenue 
gross margin decreased by percentage points from in to in the decrease in the overall gross margin was mainly due to overall decreases in revenue and shifts of product sales mix of our semiconductor products as we sold more of our lower performance products  which yield lower gross margins compared to our higher performance products 
in addition  contributing to the overall decrease in gross margin in compared to was the write downs of celestial semiconductor product inventories of approximately million during the first quarter of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  in compared to our research and development expense in included million from a variable interest entity  or vie  and the remaining research and development expense increase of million or compared to was partly due to higher salaries and benefit expenses of million and stock based compensation expenses and related taxes of million as a result of an increase in average headcount throughout the year and additional expense associated with stock option and restricted stock unit grants 
in addition  depreciation and amortization expense increased by million as a result of an increase in purchased technology licenses used for research and development projects 
outsourced product development cost also 
table of contents increased by million as well as facilities expense  design tools and other miscellaneous research and development expenses  combined of  as a result of the increase in research and development activities to support the development of our new products 
research and development headcount increased to excluding employees of a vie at end of from at the end of sales  general and administrative expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in compared to the increase was mainly due to higher expenses in associated with certain non recurring charges related to loss on disposition of certain consumer product assets of million  and higher intangible impairment of million  which were partly offset by a non recurring credit associated with the proceeds from settlement of an escrow claim of million 
contributing to higher sales  general and administrative expenses in compared to was also the non recurring credits in related to the change in contingent earn out consideration of million and the release of the assumed liability from business acquisition of million 
in addition  stock based compensation expense and related taxes increased by million in compared to as a result of additional expense associated with option and restricted unit grants and vesting acceleration of certain option grants 
the total restructuring related cost associated with severance payments to certain employees and excess facility related costs increased by  in compared to the increase in total sales  general and administrative expenses as discussed above was partially offset by the decrease in in salaries and employee benefits of million as a result of the decrease in headcount and lower outside services  which includes legal  audit and consulting fees of million due to the timing of when the costs were incurred generally related to acquisition of businesses 
sales  general and administrative headcount decreased to at end of from at end of goodwill impairment 
we review goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of the fourth calendar quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the goodwill impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter did not result in an impairment charge during the year ended december  in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance  we performed a two step impairment test on our reporting units as part of our annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of and concluded that goodwill impairment does not exist in our semiconductor reporting unit due to significant excess of the fair value over the carrying value of the reporting unit 
in the first step of the impairment test of our software and services reporting unit  the fair value of the related reporting unit was compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill to determine if a potential impairment existed 
the fair value estimate in step one was determined using the weighted fair values derived from the income and market approach 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows which include assumptions for  among others  forecasted revenue  gross margins  working capital cash flows  growth rates  and long term discount rates  all of which requires significant judgment by management 
the long term discount rate used is based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risks associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business s ability to execute on the projected cash flows 
the assumptions took into account the current industry environment and its impact on our business 
the market approach utilized valuation multiples based on operating and valuation metrics from comparable companies in the industry 
the change in the value of the reporting unit from the prior year and the interim period were primarily due to the decline in forecasted cash flow  a significant decline in the revenues related to the sale of certain assets of montavista  which also impacted the fair value of the business unit  and overall industry comparables on revenue multiples 
the reporting unit s fair value following the described fair value estimation approach amounted to million 
as a result of the first step of the goodwill impairment test  we determined that impairment existed within our software and services reporting unit as the carrying amount of the related reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis  the reporting unit s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is less than the carrying value  the difference is recorded as an impairment loss 
based on our analyses  the implied fair value of goodwill was lower than the carrying value of 
table of contents goodwill for the software and services reporting unit 
as a result  we recorded million for the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in the consolidated statement of operations 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million in compared to benefit from income taxes of million in the provision for income taxes for was primarily related to the establishment of valuation allowance against our federal and state net deferred tax assets 
the need for valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in making such assessment  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
after considering both negative and positive evidence to assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not we would not realize the full value of our federal and state deferred tax assets 
negative evidence includes a three year cumulative loss in united states jurisdiction and million impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  which was a new significant event that led to reevaluation of our position on valuation allowance 
as such  we determined that as of december   a full valuation allowance is required on our net federal and state deferred tax assets 
in all other jurisdictions with deferred tax assets  we had cumulative positive earnings in recent years which are verifiable and therefore heavily weighted such that the remaining deferred tax assets did not require a valuation allowance 
the benefit from income taxes for was primarily related to the federal research and development credits and stock based compensation related to the joint research and development arrangement with our foreign affiliate  partially offset by the foreign rate differential due to foreign loss being tax benefited at lower rates than the us statutory rate 
on january   the president of the united states signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of under prior law  a taxpayer was entitled to a research tax credit for qualifying amounts paid or incurred on or before december  the taxpayer relief act extends the research credit for two years to december  the extension of the research credit is retroactive and includes amounts paid or incurred after december  as a result of the retroactive extension  we expect to record a deferred tax asset up to million after adjusting for any corresponding unrecognized tax benefit in before valuation allowance 
the benefit  if any after considering valuation allowance  will be recognized in the period of enactment  which is the first quarter of other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  increased by  in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher interest expense associated with long term capital lease payable  which was partially offset by lower other expenses  net mainly from lower foreign exchange losses resulting from balance sheet remeasurement 
fiscal compared to fiscal net revenue 
our net revenue in increased by million or compared to the increase in net revenue in was mainly attributable to an increase in sales to our enterprise  data center and service provider markets by million  broadband and consumer market of million and software and services market of million 
the overall increase in our enterprise  data center and service provider markets  combined and our broadband and consumer market was mainly as a result of strong shipment growth driven largely by the increase in our customer demands 
the increase in demands was positively impacted by both the transition to volume production of design wins from prior years  as well as increased demand for our products already in production as a result of generally improved global economic conditions and an overall increase in demand for our customers products  all of which led to an increase in sales and shipment of our products 
the increased revenue from our software and services market was mainly driven by increased in number of professional service contracts with our existing and new customers 
cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of revenue increased in by million or compared to primarily due to the increase in net revenue 
gross margin decreased by percentage points from in to in the decrease in the overall gross margin percentage was primarily due to the 
table of contents increase in inventory reserves related to the product inventories from acquired companies in  as well as decrease in certain product prices for selected customers as a result of market and competitive conditions  which was partially offset by the overall decrease of product cost associated with fabricated wafers  assembly and test costs and improved overhead absorption as a result of the increased production volume 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher salaries and benefit expenses of million and stock based compensation expenses and related taxes of million as a result of an increase in headcount mainly from acquisitions and additional expense associated with stock option and restricted stock unit grants 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million as a result of the increased purchased technology licenses used for research and development projects 
in addition  facilities expense  design tools and other miscellaneous research and development expenses increased by million as a result of the increase in research and development activities to support the development of our new products 
research and development headcount increased to at end of from at the end of sales  general and administrative expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or in compared to the increase was primarily attributable to higher salaries and employee benefits of million and stock based compensation and related taxes of million as a result of the increase in headcount and additional expense associated with stock option and restricted stock unit grants 
in addition  outsourced services  which includes legal  audit and consulting fees increased by million mainly as a result of the business acquisitions 
in  we also recorded total restructuring costs of million associated with severance payments to certain employees and excess facility related costs 
other miscellaneous sales  general and administrative expenses which include rent  facilities and utilities increased by million as a result of the overall business growth and development 
the overall increase as a result of above was partially offset by the net one time adjustments of million related to the reversal of the contingent earn out liability of million  reversal of an assumed liability from business acquisition of million  net of ipr d written off of million and write down of acquired intangible assets of million 
sales  general and administrative headcount increased to at end of from at end of provision for benefit from income taxes 
the benefit from income taxes decreased from million in to million in the benefit from income taxes for was primarily related to the federal research and development credits and stock based compensation related to the joint research and development arrangement with our foreign affiliate  partially offset by the foreign rate differential due to foreign loss being tax benefited at lower rates than the us statutory rate 
the benefit from income taxes for primarily consists of a million tax benefit due to the release of valuation allowance for federal income tax assets  partially offset by tax provision of million from federal tax expense primarily relating to an adjustment to unrecognized tax benefit reserves for transfer pricing and various state and international taxes 
the release of the valuation allowance in was due to the results of our assessment that sufficient positive evidence existed from our historical operations and future projections to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would fully realize our federal deferred tax assets 
in making this determination  we considered all available evidence  both positive and negative 
such evidence include  among others  our history of losses and profitability  jurisdictional income recognition trends  taxable income adjusted for certain extraordinary and other items  the impact of acquisitions  and forecasted income by jurisdiction 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  decreased by million in compared to the decrease in interest income and other  net was primarily due to the provision for a note receivable of million that was deemed uncollectible in interest expense decreased as a result of lower long term capital lease payable  which was offset by the increase in foreign exchange losses resulting from balance sheet remeasurement

cash equivalents consist primarily of an investment in a money market fund 
we believe that our million of cash and cash equivalents at december   and expected cash flow from operations  if any  will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our engineering  sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of our expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
although we currently are not a party to any agreement with respect to potential material investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  other than disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
indemnities in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into agreements with customers that include indemnity provisions 
based on historical experience and information known as of december   we believe our exposure related to the above indemnities at december   is not material 
we also enter into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include similar indemnification obligations to our officers and directors 
it is not possible to determine the amount of our liability related to these indemnification agreements and obligations to our officers and directors due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented  we did not have  nor do we currently have  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease and technology license obligations total as of december   we had  of accrued liabilities from uncertain tax positions and related interest that could result in an additional tax assessment if successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
the timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend upon a number of factors 
accordingly  the timing of payment cannot be estimated 
we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations to occur within the next months 
in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  are either not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk most of our sales are denominated in united states dollars 
we therefore have minimal foreign currency risk associated with sale of products 
our international sales and marketing and research and development operations incur expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these expenses could be materially affected by currency fluctuations  however  we do not consider this currency risk to be material as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total spending 
we outsource our wafer fabrication  assembly  testing  warehousing and shipping operations  however  all expenses related thereto are denominated in united states dollars 
interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively  which was held for working capital purposes 
our cash equivalents at december  and  consisted of investments in a money market fund 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these investments as a result of changes in interest rates due to their short term nature 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income
