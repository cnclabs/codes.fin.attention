item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we develop and manufacture products primarily for medical applications 
we market components to other equipment manufacturers for incorporation in their products and sell finished devices to physicians  hospitals  clinics and other treatment centers 
our medical products primarily serve the fluid delivery  cardiovascular  and ophthalmology markets 
our other medical and non medical products include valves and inflation devices used in marine and aviation safety products 
in  approximately percent of our sales were outside the united states 
our products are used in a wide variety of applications by numerous customers 
we encounter competition in all of our markets and compete primarily on the basis of product quality  price  engineering  customer service and delivery time 
our strategy is to provide a broad selection of products in the areas of our expertise 
research and development efforts are focused on improving current products and developing highly engineered products that meet customer needs and serve niche markets with meaningful sales potential 
proposed new products may be subject to regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization and the time period for introducing a new product to the marketplace can be unpredictable 
we also focus on controlling costs by investing in modern manufacturing technologies and controlling purchasing processes 
we have been successful in consistently generating cash from operations and have used that cash to reduce or eliminate indebtedness  to fund capital expenditures  to make investment purchases  to repurchase stock and to pay dividends 
our strategic objective is to further enhance our position in our served markets by focusing on customer needs  expanding existing product lines and developing new products  maintaining a culture of controlling cost  and preserving and fostering a collaborative  entrepreneurial management structure 
for the year ended december   we reported revenues of million  operating income of million and net income of million 
results of operations our net income was million  or per basic and per diluted share  in  compared to net income of million  or per basic and per diluted share  in and net income of million  or per basic and per diluted share  in revenues were million in  compared with million in and million in the percent revenue increase in over and percent revenue increase in over were generally attributable to higher sales volumes 
increases in revenues in in our fluid delivery and cardiovascular product lines were largely offset by reduced sales to a large customer with which we have a long term contract that had accumulated too large of an inventory of one of our products in annual revenues by product lines were as follows in thousands fluid delivery cardiovascular ophthalmology other total our cost of goods sold was million in and million in each of and product mix  higher depreciation expense and lower manufacturing efficiencies in one product line partially offset by the impact of continued cost improvement initiatives were the primary contributors to the percent increase in cost of goods sold for over gross profit in was million compared with million in and million in our gross profit was percent of revenues in  percent of revenues in and percent of revenues in the decrease in gross profit percentage in was primarily related to a product mix that was less favorable than s product mix 
the increases in gross profit percentage in from the prior year were primarily due to a more favorable product mix  improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and the impact of cost savings projects 
operating expenses were million in compared with million in and million in in increases in selling expenses and increases in research and development  or r d  expenses were partially offset by decreases in general and administrative  or g a  expenses 
r d expenses increased  in as compared to primarily related to increased compensation costs  increased supplies costs  increased travel costs and increased outside services 
r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of our r d personnel as well as costs associated with regulatory matters 
in  selling expenses increased  primarily related to increased compensation  commissions and promotional expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and other related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  marketing  advertising and promotional expenses 
g a expenses decreased  in as compared to primarily related to decreased outside services 
g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related expenses of administrative  executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees 
in  increases in g a expenses and increases in r d expenses were partially offset by decreases in selling expenses 
g a expenses increased million in as compared to primarily related to increased compensation and increased outside services 
r d expenses increased  in as compared to primarily related to increased compensation costs  increased supplies costs and increased outside services 
in  selling expenses decreased  primarily related to decreased compensation and promotional expenses 
our operating income for was million  compared with million in and million in operating income was percent of revenues for  percent of revenues for and percent of revenues for the decrease in gross profit and the increase in operating expenses described above were the major contributors to the operating income decrease in compared to the previous year 
the increase in gross profit partially offset by the increase in operating expenses described above was the major contributor to the operating income improvement in compared to the previous year 
during we anticipate increases in r d expenses and depreciation charges 
after taking these items into consideration  we expect growth in our operating income during as compared to our interest income for was million compared with million in and million in the increases in and were primarily related to the increased levels of cash and investments during and results for and were also favorably impacted by investing in bonds with slightly longer maturities and higher yields 
income tax expense in totaled million  compared with million in and million in the effective tax rates for  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for was primarily related to a favorable adjustment to an uncertain tax position related to income tax credits claimed for research and development following the conclusion of an internal revenue service examination of our united states federal income tax returns for  and benefits from tax incentives for domestic production totaled  in   in and  in benefits from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled  in and  in expenses from changes in uncertain tax positions totaled  in we expect our effective tax rate for to be approximately percent 
liquidity and capital resources effective october   our revolving credit facility with a money center bank was amended to increase the maximum principal amount of our revolving line of credit from million to million and to extend the termination date for advances under the revolving line of credit to october  the credit facility is to be utilized for the funding of operations and for major capital projects or acquisitions  subject to certain limitations and restrictions 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest that is payable monthly at day  day or day libor  as selected by us  plus one percent 
from time to time prior to october  and assuming an event of default is not then existing  we can convert outstanding advances under the revolving line of credit to term loans with a term of up to two years 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at december  or the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
we believe the bank providing the credit facility is highly rated and that the entire million under the credit facility is currently available to us 
if that bank were unable to provide such funds  we believe such inability would not impact our ability to fund operations 
at december   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  a decrease of million from december  the principal contributor to this decrease was the payment of dividends and payments for acquisitions of property  plant and equipment  which was partially offset by the cash generated by operating activities 
cash flows provided by operations of million in were primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non cash expenses less net changes in working capital items 
accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were the primary contributors to the negative net change in working capital items 
the change in accounts receivable was primarily related to increased sales in the fourth quarter of as compared with the fourth quarter of the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily related to reduced accrued compensation 
at december   we had working capital of million  including million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
the million decrease in working capital during was primarily related to decreases in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the net decrease in cash and short term investments was primarily related to payment of a special cash dividend in working capital items consisted primarily of cash  accounts receivable  short term investments  inventories and other current assets minus accounts payable and other current liabilities 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million in  compared with million in and million in these expenditures were primarily for machinery and equipment 
we expect capital expenditures  primarily machinery and equipment  to approximate the average of the levels expended during each of the past three years 
we paid cash dividends totaling million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in november  our board of directors declared a special cash dividend of per share on our outstanding common stock 
this dividend which totaled million was paid on december  in  we paid two special cash dividends totaling per share on our outstanding common stock amounting to million 
we expect to fund future dividend payments with cash flows from operations 
we purchased treasury stock totaling million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the table below summarizes debt  lease and other contractual obligations outstanding at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter in thousands purchase obligations total in the current credit and financial markets  many companies are finding it difficult to gain access to capital resources 
in spite of the current economic conditions  we believe our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  cash flows from operations and available borrowings of up to million under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the foreseeable future 
we believe our strong financial position would allow us to access equity or debt financing should that be necessary 
additionally  we expect our cash and cash equivalents and investments  as a whole  will continue to increase in off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
impact of inflation we experience the effects of inflation primarily in the prices we pay for labor  materials and services 
over the last three years  we have experienced the effects of moderate inflation in these costs 
at times  we have been able to offset a portion of these increased costs by increasing the sales prices of our products 
however  competitive pressures have not allowed for full recovery of these cost increases 
new accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting standards updates applicable to us are issued by the fasb  which we will adopt as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe the impact of recently issued standards updates that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in the preparation of these financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
from time to time  we accrue legal costs associated with certain litigation 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law and other case specific issues 
we believe these accruals are adequate to cover the legal fees and expenses associated with litigating these matters 
however  the time and cost required to litigate these matters as well as the outcomes of the proceedings may vary from what we have projected 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments 
on an ongoing basis  the collectability of accounts receivable is assessed based upon historical collection trends  current economic factors and the assessment of the collectability of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectability of specific accounts and determine when to grant credit to our customers using a combination of factors  including the age of the outstanding balances  evaluation of customers current and past financial condition  recent payment history  current economic environment  and discussions with our personnel and with the customers directly 
accounts are written off when it is determined the receivable will not be collected 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the collectability of amounts could be changed by a material amount 
we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and uncertain tax positions in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not  do not establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
we assess the impairment of our long lived identifiable assets  excluding goodwill which is tested for impairment as explained below  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows 
although we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows or future changes in our business plan could materially affect our evaluations 
no such changes are anticipated at this time 
we assess goodwill for impairment pursuant to asc  intangibles goodwill and other  which requires that goodwill be assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis by applying a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
during  and  none of our critical accounting policy estimates required significant adjustments 
we did not note any material events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of long lived assets were not recoverable 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks foreign exchange risk we are not exposed to material fluctuations in currency exchange rates because the payments from our international customers are received primarily in united states dollars 
principal and interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments consist of money market accounts and taxable corporate bonds 
our investment policy is to seek to manage these assets to achieve the goal of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns subject to established investment guidelines 
in general  the primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of and the return on the investment to fluctuate 
forward looking statements statements in this management s discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this form k that are forward looking are based upon current expectations  and actual results or future events may differ materially 
therefore  the inclusion of such forward looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us that our objectives or plans will be achieved 
such statements include  but are not limited to  our expectations regarding our research and development expenditures in  our depreciation charges in  our effective tax rate  our ability to obtain component parts in the event of a supply disruption  our earnings in  the applicability of the percent excise tax on sales of certain of our medical products  our growth in operating income in  our capital expenditures  funding future dividend payments with cash flows from operations  availability of equity and debt financing  our ability to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  our ability to fund operations if the bank providing our credit facility were unable to lend funds to us  the impact on our consolidated financial statement of recently issued accounting standards when we adopt those standards  and increases in in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
words such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends  should  plans  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
forward looking statements contained herein involve numerous risks and uncertainties  and there are a number of factors that could cause actual results or future events to differ materially  including  but not limited to  the following changing economic  market and business conditions  acts of war or terrorism  the effects of governmental regulation  the impact of competition and new technologies  slower than anticipated introduction of new products or implementation of marketing strategies  implementation of new manufacturing processes or implementation of new information systems  our ability to protect our intellectual property  changes in the prices of raw materials  changes in product mix  intellectual property and product liability claims and product recalls  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and the loss of any significant customers 
in addition  assumptions relating to budgeting  marketing  product development and other management decisions are subjective in many respects and thus susceptible to interpretations and periodic review which may cause us to alter our marketing  capital expenditures or other budgets  which in turn may affect our results of operations and financial condition
