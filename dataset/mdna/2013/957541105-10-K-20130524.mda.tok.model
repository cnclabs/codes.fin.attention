in the quarter ended march   million of the escrow was released 
the company expects the cash held in escrow that is in excess of the obligation covered by the indemnity provisions to be released to the company during fiscal year on april   the company sold certain assets and transferred certain liabilities of the cns segment to netgear  inc for million in cash the cns asset sale 
as part of the cns asset sale  most of the cns segment s customer relationships  contracts and employees were transferred to netgear 
the company retained a major cns customer relationship and contract 
the company completed the remaining contracted product shipments under this contract in december during the first three quarters of fiscal year  the company continued to provide warranty services under its contractual obligations and to sell ancillary products and software on a project basis to the retained customer 
the company expects no cns activity with that retained customer going forward 
the company also retained the homecloud product development program 
the homecloud product family aims to provide a new suite of services into the home  with an initial focus on media and information management  sharing and delivery  and with prospective functionality applicable to enhanced security  home control  and network management 
in the westell segment  the company designs  distributes  markets and services a broad range of carrier class products 
the company s westell product family consists of indoor and outdoor cabinets  enclosures and mountings  power distribution products  network interface devices nids for tdm sonet networks and service demarcation  span powering equipment  remote monitoring devices  copper fiber connectivity panels  managed ethernet switches for utility and industrial networks  ethernet extension devices for providing native ethernet service handoff in carrier applications  wireless signal conditioning and monitoring products for cellular networks  tower mounted amplifiers  cell site antenna sharing products for cell site 
table of contents optimization  and custom systems integration csi services 
legacy products are sold primarily into wireline markets  but the company also is actively moving to develop revenues from wireless telecommunications products 
in the quarter ended september   the company completed the relocation of the production of power distribution and remote monitoring products  which were manufactured at the company s noran tel subsidiary located in regina  saskatchewan  canada  to its location in aurora  illinois 
the remaining operations in regina  canada  are focused on power distribution product development and on sales of westell products in canada 
effective as of april  with the acquisition of kentrox  the company designs  distributes  markets and services intelligent site management solutions  which provide comprehensive monitoring  management and control of a broad range of devices 
the machine to machine mm communications kentrox provides enable service providers  tower operators  and other network operators to reduce operating costs while improving network performance 
the company provides a suite of remote monitoring and control devices  which when combined with its optima management system provide a comprehensive  bi directional solution 
the kentrox solution addresses customer needs such as power management generator management  battery  fuel  and rectifier monitoring  tenant power metering  etc  environmental management hvac monitoring  energy monitoring and control  aircraft warning light management  and environmental monitoring  security management access management  asset tampering  and surveillance  and communications management microwave and distributed antenna systems management 
customers include major wireless and fixed line telecommunications carriers  tower providers  cable and broadband network providers  utility companies  and enterprises 
kentrox provides solutions to customers in north and south america  australia  africa  and europe 
the prices for the company products vary based upon volume  customer specifications and other criteria  and they are subject to change for a variety of reasons  including cost and competitive factors 
the company s customer base for its products is highly concentrated and comprised primarily of major telecommunications service providers  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telecom administrations located in the us and canada 
due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling most of its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and in targeted sales and marketing efforts to launch new product lines 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change meeting technical specifications or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company business and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and invest in product research and development activities 
in view of the company s reliance on the telecommunications market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
the company has experienced quarterly fluctuations in customer ordering and purchasing activity that appear to result from seasonal factors  including reductions in order volume and product deliveries for outdoor equipment as colder months approach and occur  and including the effects of customer vacation  budgeting and procurement patterns toward the end of the calendar year which may cause reductions or increases in activity 
this seasonality can result in weaker revenue primarily in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
the seasonal effects do not apply consistently and may not always correlate to financial results 
accordingly  they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and that affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods 
the company bases estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amounts reported 
in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company includes a discussion of its significant accounting policies 
the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the company considers an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made concerning uncertainties  and if changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents business combinations the company applies the guidance of asc topic  business combinations 
this guidance requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transaction  establish the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  requires expensing of transaction and restructuring costs  and requires the acquirer to disclose the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
inventory valuation the company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reserve for obsolete and potentially obsolete inventory 
the company also evaluates inventory to adjust valuations to be the lower of cost or market value 
prices anticipated for future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into non cancellable commitments for the purchase of inventory 
the commitments are negotiated to be at market rates 
should there be a significant decline in revenues the company may absorb excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company establishes reserves for potential losses on at risk commitments 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of asc topic  income taxes asc 
asc requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets  including net operating loss nol and certain tax credit carryovers and liabilities  are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets which are assessed as not likely to be realized 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
this evaluation requires the use of estimates and assumptions and considers all positive and negative evidence and factors  such as the scheduled reversal of temporary differences  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the dates of enactment 
the company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits based upon its assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and recognizes interest and penalties  if any  related to its unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
see note for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill is not amortized  but it is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the two step  quantitative  goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step tests for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
fair value of a reporting unit is determined by using both an income approach and a market approach  because this combination is considered to produce the most reasonable indication of fair value in an orderly transaction between market participants 
under the income approach  the company determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of a reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the level of risk inherent in a reporting unit and its associated estimates of future cash flows as well as the rate of return an experienced investor might expect to earn 
under the market approach  the company utilizes valuation multiples derived from publicly 
table of contents available information for comparable companies to provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace might be willing to pay for a company 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value  a quantitative fair value assessment is performed and compared to the carrying value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  impairment is recorded 
intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives 
if the company were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful life of an intangible asset was necessary  then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets with a definite life and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
any impairment loss would adjust the asset to its implied fair value 
revenue recognition the company records revenue from sales transactions when title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue recognition on equipment where software is incidental to the product as a whole  or where software is essential to the equipment s functionality and falls under software accounting scope exceptions  generally occurs when products are shipped  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met  no significant obligations remain  collection is reasonably assured and warranty can be estimated 
where multiple element arrangements exist  fair value of each element is established using the relative selling price method  which requires the company to use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  reliable third party objective evidence tpe or management s best estimate of selling price  in that order 
stock based compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation expense for all employee stock based payments based upon the fair value on the award s grant date over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of equity based options requires the company to estimate the expected volatility of its stock  the risk free interest rate  expected option term  expected dividend yield and expected forfeitures 
product warranties most of the company s products carry a limited warranty of up to seven years 
the company accrues for estimated warranty costs as products are shipped based on historical sales and cost of repair or replacement trends relative to sales 
new accounting standards adopted in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
asu provides entities with an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if an entity concludes that it is more than likely that an indefinite lived intangible asset is not impaired  no further analysis is required 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  it would be required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to measure the amount of actual impairment  if any  as currently required under the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of this pronouncement did not materially impact the company s financial condition or results of operations

table of contents other income expense other income expense  net was million  million  and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
other income expense  net contains interest income earned on short term investments and foreign currency gains and losses 
income tax expense benefit income tax in fiscal years and was expense of million and million  respectively  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year in fiscal year  the company considered both the positive and negative evidence available to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
the company considered negative factors which included recent losses and a forecasted three year cumulative loss position  as well as positive evidence consisting primarily of projected future earnings 
the company concluded that the negative evidence outweighed the objectively verifiable positive evidence 
as a result  the company increased the valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets by million  which taken together with the liability for uncertain tax positions  has the effect of reserving in full all of the company deferred tax assets as of march  in fiscal year  the company sold its conferenceplus subsidiary and completed the cns asset sale 
these events resulted in a million taxable gain in fiscal year and changed the outlook for future taxable income  positively with regards to the cns business which contributed to the majority of the company s historical losses and negatively in certain states where income generated by conferenceplus was apportioned 
in addition  certain states for which the company has net operating loss carryforwards  such as illinois  suspended the use of those carryforwards 
the company therefore was not able to utilize those carryforwards to offset fiscal year taxable income 
the company considered both the positive and negative evidence and established a forecast of future taxable income to evaluate the deferred tax assets for realizability 
on this basis  the company concluded that it was more likely than not that it would be able to utilize the majority of its deferred tax assets  but that certain state net operating loss carryforwards would expire prior to utilization 
as a result  the company increased the valuation allowance reserve by million to million in fiscal year in addition  the company recognized million of net tax benefits relating to the change in uncertain tax positions 
in fiscal year  after considering both the positive and negative evidence  including improved financial performance  expected future taxable income  the exit from a three year cumulative loss  and the sale of the majority of its cns business for a million taxable gain  the company concluded that it was more likely than not that it would be able to utilize the majority of its deferred tax assets

as a result of the fiscal year assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets and current year income  the valuation allowance decreased by million  which was recorded as an income tax benefit in fiscal year the company also recognized an additional million of tax benefits relating to changes in or expirations of uncertain tax positions 
discontinued operations on december   the company sold its conferenceplus subsidiary for a gain of million after income taxes 
the results of operations of conferenceplus along with the gain on the sale have been classified as income from discontinued operations 
in fiscal year  net loss from discontinued operations was million

net income from discontinued operations was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
net income loss in fiscal year  the company incurred a net loss of million 
net income was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the changes were due to the cumulative effects of the variances identified above 
quarterly results of operations the company has experienced  and may continue to experience  fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
such fluctuations in quarterly results may correspond to substantial fluctuations in the market price of the class a common stock 
some factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include  but are not limited to  the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for excess or obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers  working capital deficits and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not 
table of contents necessarily meaningful and caution should be used when placing reliance upon such comparisons as indications of future performance 
for a detailed comparison of the eight quarters ended march   see note  quarterly results of operations unaudited  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

off balance sheet arrangements of the company include the enginuity note described in note of the consolidated financial statements and standard operating leases 
total future obligations and commitments as of march   were million 
the company believes that the existing sources of liquidity and cash from operations will satisfy cash flow requirements for the foreseeable future

the contingent consideration is paid quarterly through june  cash flows the consolidated statements of cash flows include the conferenceplus discontinued operations and therefore the explanations below include cash flows of conferenceplus 
the company s operating activities used cash of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  and generated cash of million in fiscal year cash used in fiscal year resulted primarily from a million net loss that includes million of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense  a million decrease in deferred tax assets and a million decrease in working capital 
cash used in fiscal year resulted primarily from net income of million that includes million of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense  a million decrease in deferred tax assets and an million decrease in working capital 
the changes in working capital in fiscal year resulted predominantly from the sale of the cns business combined with the wind down of that business

also  as of march   the company had a million tax contingency reserve related to uncertain tax positions 
federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal year realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration  among other factors 
the company weighed positive and negative evidence to assess the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and whether a tax benefit should be recorded when taxable losses are incurred 
the existence of a valuation allowance does not limit the availability of tax assets to reduce taxes payable when taxable income arises 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and may adjust the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets accordingly 
off balance sheet arrangements in fiscal year  the company sold its data station termination product lines and specified fixed assets to enginuity communications corporation enginuity 
the company provided an unconditional guarantee relating to a year term note payable by enginuity to a third party lender that financed the transaction the enginuity note

these personal guarantees will stay in place until the note is paid in full  as will the company s 
under the company s guarantee  the company must pay all amounts due under the note payable upon demand from the lender  however  the company would have recourse against the assets of enginuity  the personal guarantees  and pledged assets 
the company evaluated asc and concluded that enginuity is a vie as a result of the debt guarantee 
the company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the vie and consolidation therefore is not required 
at the time of the product sale  the company assessed its obligation under this guarantee pursuant to the provisions of asc topic guarantees asc  and recorded a million liability for the value of the guarantee 
the company evaluates the fair value of the liability based on enginuity s operating performance and the current status of the guaranteed debt obligation and determined no liability is needed as of march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency rate exposures and interest rates 
foreign currency risk the company s primary foreign currency exposure is to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the canadian dollar and the related effects on receivables and payables denominated in canadian dollars 
the company s foreign subsidiary  noran tel  is located in canada 
in the quarter ended september   the company completed the relocation of the production of products from canada to its headquarters in aurora  il 
noran tel has five remaining employees located in canada and is now focused on the development of power distribution products and the sale of westell products in canada 
noran tel is funded by the us operations
