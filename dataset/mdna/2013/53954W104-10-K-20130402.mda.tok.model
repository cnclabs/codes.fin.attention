during the second quarter of  we acquired krillion which includes a robust local product search platform that enables consumers to search for products and product availability at local retailers 
in the third quarter of  we acquired smg  a daily deals business  as part of our efforts to expand our own daily deals business  spreebird located at www 
spreebird 
com  which we had launched in may we have been regularly developing and deploying new features and functionality to each of these channels designed to enhance 
table of contents the experience of our users and increase the value of our audience to our advertisers 
with a strategic focus on three key drivers for our business traffic  technology and advertisers we believe we can improve our bottom line results by increasing our margin on our largest business  o o  and growing our most profitable business  the network 
corporate highlights on march   we entered into the first amendment to the loan and security agreement with square one bank  which amends the loan and security agreement by and between us and square one bank dated august  loan agreement 
the first amendment to the loan agreement modifies the borrowing base eligibility criteria under the loan agreement  provides a five day cure period for any liquidity ratio violations before any such violation would be deemed an event of default under the loan agreement  and establishes certain adjusted ebitda financial covenant  as defined  levels for fiscal pursuant to the loan agreement 
on april   we entered into the second amendment to loan agreement with square one bank  which amends the loan agreement by and between us and square one bank dated august  the second amendment of the loan agreement modifies the maximum allowable borrowings under the non formula line by increasing the maximum to million from million under certain circumstances 
additionally  it redefines the liquidity ratio to provide that non formula borrowings only require a ratio  rather than the ratio 
on august   we entered into the third amendment of the loan agreement to lower the maintenance limits for its depository and operating accounts to and to amend the definition of adjusted ebitda to exclude any non cash expenses  as well as to provide a waiver of a technical violation of the adjusted ebitda covenant described in section a of the agreement that occurred prior to the definition amendment noted above 
during the second quarter  we decided to sell all assets relating to our rovion business 
the rovion business  which is considered a usage model  did not align with our intent to become both a local media publisher and local advertising sales and marketing organization 
on october   we sold all assets relating to the rovion business  for million  of which approximately million was received in cash with the remainder placed in escrow to be settled within months 
we recognized a gain on sale of the rovion business of approximately million included in net income loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the financial information in management s discussion and analysis has been updated to reflect the rovion business as discontinued operations 
at june   we performed an impairment valuation of goodwill as it related to the spreebird business unit 
the evaluation was triggered by the continued decline in the market capitalization of comparable public companies and lower than expected financial performance of the spreebird business unit during the second quarter of the evaluation resulted in an estimated impairment charge of million to goodwill 
the goodwill impairment valuation was finalized in the third quarter and no additional impairment charges were recorded 
during the second quarter of  we also recorded impairment charges relating to intangible assets and capitalized software of the spreebird business unit for  and  respectively 
on september   we changed our name from local 
com corporation to local corporation 
we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in connection with a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into us in accordance with section of the delaware general corporation law 
during the third quarter  revenue from our lec billed subscriber bases decreased significantly due to a decision by certain lec s to no longer provide billing services for our products and services 
the majority of the lec billing ceased at the end of august and the remainder of the lec billing ceased at the end of november in connection therewith  we accelerated the amortization of our subscriber base to align with the expected related future cash flows 
as of december   assets related to the lec billed subscriber bases have been fully amortized 
we also recorded an additional reserve for the long term lec receivables of approximately million and reclassified the receivable to long term receivables 

table of contents on november   we entered into a new yahoo publisher network agreement with yahoo  which provides for the distribution of yahoo s paid search results by us for which we are compensated a percentage of the adjusted gross revenue as defined in the agreement derived by yahoo from such paid search results 
the agreement with yahoo ends on october   unless earlier terminated by the parties 
during the annual impairment review of goodwill performed on december   we identified and recorded an additional impairment charge of million relating to the spreebird business unit 
this was the result of further declines in the market capitalization of comparable public companies together with lower than expected financial performance  mainly brought on by our decision due to shift our strategy away from direct sales to small and medium sized businesses in favor of channel sales opportunities 
outlook for our business according to bia kelsey  the us online advertising market is an approximately billion a year industry 
local search  that is  searches for products  services and businesses within a geographic region is an increasingly significant segment of the online advertising industry 
local search allows consumers to search for local businesses products or services by including geographic area  zip code  city and other geographically targeted search parameters in their search requests such as entering florists in irvine  ca 
according to a september study  bia kelsey estimates that the local search market in the united states will grow from billion in  to billion by consumers who conduct local searches on the internet local searchers tend to convert into buying customers at a higher rate than other types of internet users 
as a result  advertisers often pay a significant premium to place their ads in front of local searchers on websites like those powered by our consumer properties business  including local 
com or our network partners websites 
additionally  local smbs that would not normally compete at the national level for advertising opportunities are increasingly engaging in and competing for local advertising opportunities  including local search  to promote their products and services 
local online search is still relatively new  and as a result  it is difficult to determine our current market share  or predict our future market share 
however  we have a number of competitors that have announced an intention to increase their focus on local search with regard to us online advertising  including some of the leading online advertising companies in the world  including google  yahoo  and microsoft  among many others  with greater experience and resources than we have 
for example  facebook recently announced a graph search tool which allows users to access the interests and opinions of friends regarding local places  movies and interests and which may emerge as a significant competitor to our current offerings 
the us online advertising industry  including the local search segment  is regularly impacted and changed by new and emerging technologies  including  for instance  ad targeting and mobile technologies  as well as the increased fragmentation of the online advertising industry in general  from different technology platforms  to different advertising formats  targeting methodologies and the like 
those companies within our industry who are able to quickly adapt to new technologies  as well as offer innovations of their own  have a better chance of succeeding than those that do not 
we believe that local search will be an increasingly significant segment of the online advertising industry 
although search advertising has been used primarily by businesses that serve the national market  local businesses are increasingly using online advertising to attract local customers 
our consumer properties are all designed to serve this market of consumers  advertisers and publishers  which we believe will provide an opportunity for growth from increased local search volumes by consumers  as well as increased competition by advertisers to display their ad listings in front of those consumers 
our revenue  profitability and future growth depend not only on our ability to execute our business plan  but also  the growth of the paid search market and our ability to effectively compete with other providers of local  and paid search technologies and services among other things 

table of contents as we continue to diversify our technologies and traffic sources  we remain focused on local media offerings that will improve the experience for our end users  and allow our regional media network partners to enhance their service offerings and lower their costs 
while we are still very focused on the local search industry  we believe there are additional opportunities in local media that we and our customers can benefit from  while diversifying our revenue sources 
we intend to continue making significant investments in initiatives to diversify our revenue sources and promote our future growth 
as we continue to invest in our core offerings  we have increased our operating expenses  mainly related to traffic acquisition costs  the deployment of new features and functionality across our business and the support of our acquired companies 
we cannot give assurances that our efforts to improve our results of operations through this strategy will be successful 
sources of revenue we generate revenue primarily on our local 
com website and network from both direct and indirect advertiser relationships  via click throughs on sponsored listings  calls to cost per call advertiser listings  lead generation  banner ads  subscription advertiser listings  domain sales and services  web hosting services  and daily deal offerings 
operating expenses cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of traffic acquisition costs  revenue sharing payments that we make to our network partners  and other cost of revenues 
traffic acquisition costs consist primarily of campaign costs associated with driving consumers to our local 
com website  including personnel costs associated with managing traffic acquisition programs 
other cost of revenues consists of internet connectivity costs  data center costs  amortization of certain software license fees and maintenance  depreciation of computer equipment used in providing our paid search services  and payment processing fees credit cards and fees for lec billings 
we advertise on large search engine websites such as google  yahoo  msn bing and ask 
com  as well as other search engine websites  by bidding on certain keywords we believe will drive traffic to our local 
com website 
during the year ended december   approximately of our overall traffic was purchased from other search engine websites 
during the year ended december   advertising costs to drive consumers to our local 
com website were million of which million and million was attributable to google and yahoo  respectively

table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of sales commissions and salaries for our internal and outsourced sales force  customer service staff and marketing personnel  advertising and promotional expenses

owned and operated revenue for the year ended december   increased compared to the same period in the increase in revenue for the year ended december   compared to the same period in is mainly due to increased traffic to our local 
com website  together with an increase in monetization as our revenue per thousand visitors rkv increased to  for the year ended december   from for the same period in the increase in rkv was primarily a result of changes made to our advertising partner relationships 
the increase in rkv due to a new advertising partner relationship was partially offset by a significant decrease in revenue from one of our large advertising partners 
the lower rkv for the year ended december   was primarily due to the yahoo bing alliance  which resulted in changes to the yahoo search and advertising platform 
starting in august  we entered into a new advertising partner relationship that resulted in a significant increase in monetization of traffic to our owned and operated properties 
the increase in rkv due to a new advertising partner relationship was partially offset by a significant decrease in revenue from one of our large advertising partners 
the increase in traffic to our owned and operated properties are the result of higher cost of revenues to attract users as well as increased organic search traffic over the same period 
as noted above  in august  we entered into an agreement with a new advertising partner 
the revenue generated from such partner has been subject to seasonality  which has similarly subjected all of our owned and operated revenue results to seasonality 
periodically traffic providers will make changes to their policies and guidelines 
these changes could impact both our advertising campaigns to purchase traffic and the monetization of our search results pages 
during october  our largest traffic provider made certain changes to their policies and guidelines 
due to these changes we have seen a reduction in both traffic and monetization  which had a negative impact on our fourth quarter of fiscal revenue and results of operations 
while we expect to grow our o o revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal run rate  we do expect fiscal o o revenue to be lower than we also expect changes from this advertising partner in june related to bidding for mobile and desktop advertising campaigns  which may have a negative impact on our traffic and monetization of such traffic 
we continue to work closely with this traffic provider to refine our traffic acquisition approach and user experience on our search results pages 
rkv year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year 
table of contents rkv year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year network revenue for the year ended december   increased compared to the same periods in the increase is primarily due to increased traffic to our network partner websites and the increase in rpc from our advertising partner feed 
the increase in traffic is a combination of increased cost of revenues to attract users to the network partner sites together with an increase in organic traffic over the same period 
a portion of the network revenue is based on other websites for which we provide our organic and third party ad feeds 
we have experienced volatility in this portion of our network revenue related to changes in the partners traffic levels  traffic quality and market conditions for paid search 
business solutions revenue for the year ended december   decreased compared to the same periods in the decrease in revenue is due to a decrease in revenue from our lec billed subscriber bases  partially offset by an increase in revenue from our launch by local product suite and revenue from our spreebird business 
the decrease in revenue from our lec billed subscriber bases are due to a decision by certain lec s to no longer provide billing services for our products and services 
the majority of the lec billing ceased at the end of august and the remainder of the lec billing ceased at the end of november in january  we made a decision to eliminate our direct sales efforts of our launch by local product suit to small and medium size businesses 
we will still be providing our smb solution through our channel partners

this financial benefit ended december  the increase was partially offset by lower rpc s experienced in the first and second quarters of the year

business solutions revenue for the year ended december   decreased compared to the same period in  as our base of small business subscribers decreased from over  as of december   to approximately  as of december  the decrease in the small business subscriber base is due to the natural attrition of the current legacy subscriber bases  subject to prior contractual commitments  as well as our decision to suspend acquisitions of lec billed subscriber bases  subject to prior contractual commitments  in order to concentrate resources around smb product suite and investment in our spreebird daily deals business

the decrease in working capital is largely due to a decrease in cash of approximately million  which was mainly due to the timing of payments to vendors and capital expenditures for the year  partially offset by cash from the sale of the rovion business

in  we were able to reduce our operating losses excluding impairment charges through the restructuring of agreements with current partners  entering into agreements with new partners and continued efforts to optimize monetization on our o o and network properties 
these changes resulted in improvements in monetization compared to the prior year 
part of the improvement related to a new significant ad partner which was effective august  we have been able to increase traffic to our o o and network sites resulting in record traffic for the past twelve months 
during october  our largest traffic partner made changes to their policies and guidelines 
these changes had a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations for the fourth quarter we are continuing to evaluate the effects of these changes to our business and are working on making the necessary adjustments to compensate for the loss of revenue and liquidity 
although we have increased investments in recently acquired businesses  much of the investment became discretionary marketing spend beginning in the second quarter of  and is accordingly now controlled based on available working capital 
on october   we sold the rovion business for million 
of the million sales price  we received million in cash on the date of sale  while the remaining balance will be held in escrow for eighteen months and released based on the terms as stipulated in the sales agreement 
the additional cash and the cost savings from the sale of rovion had a positive impact on our cash flow and liquidity in the fourth quarter of and going forward 
on february   we executed the fifth amendment to the loan agreement with square one bank  extending the maturity date through february  in january  we made the decision to cease the direct sales effort of the launch by local product suite which we estimate will result in total cost savings for of approximately million 
the majority of the cost savings relates to reducing the headcount from at december   to approximately at february  on march   we executed the sixth amendment to the loan agreement with square one bank 
the sixth amendment waives any and all violations of the liquidity ratio covenants prior to the sixth amendment  terminates the non formula advances under the agreement and requires monthly payments of the outstanding non formula 
table of contents principal  plus all accrued interest  over months beginning on april  the above factors  among others  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we believe that we will need additional capital to fully implement our business  operating and development plans 
however  additional funding from an alternate source or sources may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that money is raised through the sale of our securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our existing security holders

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service or product has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and the collection of our fees is probable 
we generate revenue when it is realizable and earned  as evidenced by click throughs occurring on advertisers sponsored listings  the display of a banner advertisement  the fulfillment of subscription listing obligations  the sale of deal of the day vouchers  or the delivery of our smb products to our customers 
we enter into contracts to distribute sponsored listings and banner advertisements with our direct and indirect advertisers 
most of these contracts are short term  do not contain multiple elements and can be cancelled at anytime 
our indirect advertisers provide us with sponsored listings with bid prices for example  what their advertisers are willing to pay for each click through on those listings 
we recognize our portion of the bid price based upon our contractual agreement 
sponsored listings and banner advertisements are included within pages that display search results  among others  in response to keyword searches performed by consumers on our local

management has analyzed our revenue recognition and determined that our web hosting revenue will be recognized net of direct costs 
during the year ended december   we entered into multiple deliverable arrangements for the sale of domains and for providing services relating to such domains 
management evaluated the agreements in accordance with the provision of the revenue recognition topic that addresses multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the multiple deliverable arrangements entered into consisted of various units of accounting such as the sale of domains  website development fees  content delivery and hosting fees 
such elements were considered separate units of accounting due to each element having value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
the selling price for each of the units of accounting was determined using a combination of vendor specific objective evidence and management estimates 
revenue relating to domains was recognized with the transfer of title of such domains 
revenue for website development  content delivery and hosting fees are recognized as such services are performed or delivered 
the agreements did not include any cancellation  termination or refund provisions that we consider probable 
subsequent to december  we have not entered into any significant multiple deliverable arrangements 
we launched our spreebird daily deals business in may revenue relating to the spreebird daily deals business is recorded exclusive of the portion of gross billings paid as merchant revenue share  since we generally act as the agent  rather than the principal  when connecting merchants with online customers

allowance for doubtful accounts our management estimates the losses that may result from that portion of our accounts receivable that may not be collectible as a result of the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt  customer concentration  customer credit 
table of contents worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if we believe that our customers financial condition has deteriorated such that it impairs their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances may be required 
we review past due accounts on a monthly basis and record an allowance for doubtful accounts generally equal to any accounts receivable that are over days past due and for which collectability is not reasonably assured 
during the fourth quarter fiscal year  we recorded an additional reserve of million for lec related receivables 
the additional reserve was due to the cessation of billing for these services by local exchange carriers and the expectation of a longer collection cycle for these receivables 
as of december   two customers  yahoo and google  represented of our total accounts receivable 
these customers have historically paid within the payment period provided for under their contracts and management believes these customers will continue to do so 
depreciation of property and equipment depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are calculated under the straight line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows furniture and fixtures years office equipment years computer equipment years computer software years leasehold improvements years life of lease repairs and maintenance expenditures that do not significantly add to the value of the property  or prolong its life  are charged to expense  as incurred 
gains and losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the operating results of the related period 
amortization of intangible assets intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally on a straight line basis over two to four years 
the small business subscriber relationships are amortized based on how we expect the customer relationships to contribute to future cash flows 
as a result  amortization of the small business subscriber relationships intangible assets is accelerated over a period of approximately four years with the weighted average percentage amortization for all small business subscriber relationships acquired to date being approximately in year one  in year two  in year three and in year four 
our third party billing providers were notified that certain lecs would not be providing billing services for our products and services with respect to these small business subscriber relationships 
in the third and fourth quarter  we accelerated amortization relating to these small business subscriber relationships intangible assets based on the expected remaining future cash flows 
the effect of such accelerated amortization on results was approximately million 
as of december   all small business subscriber relationships intangible assets have been fully amortized 
stock based compensation calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock options  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting forfeiture rate of stock awards and in the case of restricted stock units  the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the historical market activity of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of 
table of contents management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected pre vesting award forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted and cancelled before vesting 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the original estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we recorded in the current period 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all current and previously recognized expense for unvested awards is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements

total stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  cost of revenues sales and marketing general and administrative research and development total stock based compensation expense net stock based compensation expense impact on income loss per share basic diluted accounting for income taxes we are required to recognize a provision for income taxes based upon the taxable income and temporary differences for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a calculation of taxes payable under currently enacted state and federal tax laws and an analysis of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities  including various accruals  allowances  depreciation and amortization 
the tax effect of these temporary differences is reported as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that all or some portion or the deferred tax asset will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on net operating loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations or against additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent any tax benefits would have otherwise been allocated to equity 
in making our judgment regarding the valuation allowance  we considered all evidence  both positive and negative  considering our history of losses and placing more weight on the historical results in judging our ability to realize the deferred tax asset related to net operating losses

warrant liability current guidance of us gaap regarding accounting for derivatives  which requires that certain of our warrants be accounted for as derivative instruments and that we record the warrant liability at fair value and recognize the change in valuation in our statement of operations each reporting period 
determining the warrant liability to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the fair value of the warrants 
we calculate the fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of the black scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility is derived based upon our actual historic stock prices over the contractual life of the warrants  which represents our best estimate of expected volatility  and risk free interest rate we use the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the warrant contractual life assumption as the risk free interest rate 
we are exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of the derivative liability related to outstanding warrants 
the fair value of these derivative liabilities is primarily determined by fluctuations in our stock price 
as our stock price increases or decreases  the fair value of these derivative liabilities increases or decreases  resulting in a corresponding current period loss or gain to be recognized 
based on the number of outstanding warrants  market interest rates and historical volatility of our stock price as of december   a decrease or increase in our stock price will result in a non cash derivative gain or loss of approximately  and  respectively 
on february   we exchanged all our outstanding warrants that were accounted for as derivative instruments for shares of our common stock 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets arising from acquisitions and purchased domain names are recorded at cost 
intangible assets  such as goodwill and domain names  which are determined to have an indefinite life  are not amortized 
the first step in determining if there is any goodwill impairment is a comparison of the estimated fair value of an internal reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill to a determination of the implied value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied value  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference 
we engage an independent appraiser to assist management in the valuation 
we perform annual impairment reviews during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
for other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we compare the fair value of related assets to the carrying value to determine if there is impairment 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of domain names for which the fair value is determined by using a third party valuation site which 
table of contents calculates the value of domain names using internal algorithms 
for other intangible assets with definite lives  if an impairment trigger is identified  we compare future undiscounted cash flow forecasts prepared by management to the carrying value of the related intangible asset group to determine if there is impairment 
the spreebird business unit was identified as a separate reporting unit for evaluation of goodwill impairment 
due to lower than expected financial performance by the spreebird business unit and a significant decrease in the market capitalization of comparable public companies during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that there were potential indicators of impairment at june  goodwill was tested for impairment by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit using a consideration of market multiples and a discounted cash flow model level fair value measurement and was written down to its implied fair value  which was approximately million as of june   resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million  which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we performed our annual impairment analysis as of december  during the annual impairment analysis we identified additional impairment relating to the spreebird business unit 
the additional impairment was due to continued declines in the market capitalization of comparable public companies coupled with lower than expected financial performance due to our recent shift in strategy away from direct sales to small and medium sized businesses 
using similar testing the goodwill for the spreebird business unit was written down to its implied fair value of million as of december   resulting in an impairment charge of million  which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or equity prices will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of instruments 
we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates on our current debt instruments and the risk of loss on credit extended to our customers 
we have issued equity instruments  including warrants which contain certain derivatives which fluctuate  primarily as a result of changes in our stock price 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates on our debt instruments 
during  we did not use interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate risk 
square one bank borrowings made pursuant to the formula revolving line will bear interest at a rate equal to the greater of i  or ii the prime rate as announced by square one bank  plus and borrowings made pursuant to the non formula revolving line will bear interest at a rate equal to the greater of i  or ii the prime rate as announced by square one bank  plus 
the debt outstanding under the line of credit entering is million 
therefore  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  per annum 
derivative liability risk current guidance regarding accounting for derivatives requires that certain of our warrants be accounted for as derivative instruments and that we record the warrant liability at fair value and recognize the change in valuation in our statement of operations each reporting period 
we are therefore exposed to the risk of change in the fair value of derivative liability related to outstanding warrants
