item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported results 
the company uses estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as collectability of trade accounts receivable and inventory valuation 
ultimate results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts through review of open accounts  historical collections and historical write off amounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce trade accounts receivable to the amount that reasonably approximates their net realizable value 
the amount ultimately realized from trade accounts receivable may differ from the amount estimated in the consolidated financial statements based on collection experience 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the company s inventory valuation reflects markdowns for the excess of the cost over the amount expected to be realized and considers obsolete and excess inventory 
markdowns establish a new cost basis for the company s inventory 
subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis 
revenue recognition is when both product ownership and the risk of loss have transferred to the customer  collectability is reasonably assured  and the company has no remaining obligations 
the company s ordering process creates persuasive evidence of the sale arrangement and the sales price is determined 
the delivery of the goods to the customer completes the earnings process 
net sales consist of product sales and related delivery charge revenue  net of adjustments for returns and allowances 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located  disruptions associated with shipping distances and negotiations with port employees 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
inflation increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
inflation or other pricing pressures could impact raw material costs  labor costs and interest rates which are important components of costs for the company and could have an adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
foreign currency risk during fiscal years  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  the company is not directly exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   the company does not have any debt outstanding
