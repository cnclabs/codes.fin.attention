overview limoneira company was incorporated in delaware in as the successor to several businesses with operations in california since we are an agribusiness and real estate development company founded and based in santa paula  california  committed to responsibly using and managing our approximately  acres of land  water resources and other assets to maximize long term stockholder value 
our current operations consist of fruit production  sales and marketing  real estate development and capital investment activities 
we are one of california s oldest citrus growers 
according to sunkist  we are one of the largest growers of lemons in the united states and  according to the california avocado commission  one of the largest growers of avocados in the united states 
in addition to growing lemons and avocados  we grow oranges and a variety of other specialty citrus and other crops 
we have agricultural plantings throughout ventura and tulare counties in california  which plantings consist of approximately  acres of lemons   acres of avocados   acres of oranges and acres of specialty citrus and other crops 
we also operate our own packinghouse in santa paula  california  where we process and pack lemons that we grow  as well as lemons grown by others 
our water resources include water rights  usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under  and canals that run through  the land we own 
water for our farming operations is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land  which includes rights to water in the adjudicated santa paula basin aquifer and the un adjudicated fillmore  santa barbara and paso robles basins aquifers

from a general view  we see the company as a land and farming company that generates annual cash flows to support its progress into diversified real estate development activities 
as real estate developments are monetized  our agriculture business will then be able to expand more rapidly into new regions and markets 
recent developments effective november   we amended the interest rate on one of the term loans we have with farm credit west to a fixed rate of for three years

in november  we entered into a second amendment to amended and restated line of credit agreement in order to i increase the revolving line of credit from million to the lesser of million or of the appraised value of any real estate pledged as collateral  which was  at october   ii amend the interest rate such that the line of credit bears interest at a rate equal to libor plus  and iii extend the maturity date from june  to june  we have the option of fixing the interest rate under the rabobank credit facility on any portion of outstanding borrowings using interest rate swaps 
at october   the interest rate was fixed at utilizing interest rate swaps on million of the rabobank credit facility 
in november  we entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement with rabobank international  utrecht to fix the interest rate at on million of outstanding borrowings under the rabobank credit facility beginning july until june this interest rate swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge and is accounted for as a hedge under the short cut method 
therefore  the fair value liability of million is included in other long term liabilities and related accumulated other comprehensive loss at october  additional information regarding the interest rate swaps can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the rabobank credit facility is secured by certain of our agricultural properties and a portion of the equity interest in the san cayetano mutual water company  and subjects us to affirmative and restrictive covenants including  among other customary covenants  financial reporting requirements  requirements to maintain and repair any collateral  restrictions on the sale of assets  restrictions on the use of proceeds  prohibitions on the incurrence of additional debt and restrictions on the purchase or sale of major assets 
we also are subject to a covenant that we will maintain a debt service coverage ratio  as defined in the rabobank credit facility  of less than to measured annually at october  with which we were in compliance at october  farm credit west term loans and non revolving credit facility as of october   we had an aggregate of million outstanding under the farm credit west term loans and farm credit west line of credit 
the following provides further discussion on the term loans and non revolving credit facility term loan maturing november as of october   we had million outstanding under the farm credit west term loan that matures in november this term loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to an internally calculated rate based on farm credit west s internal monthly operations and their cost of funds and generally follows the changes in the day treasury rates in increments divisible by and is payable in quarterly installments through november the interest rate resets monthly and was at october  this term loan is secured by certain of our agricultural properties 
term loan maturing may as of october   we had million outstanding under the farm credit west term loan that matures in may this term loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to an internally calculated rate based on farm credit west s internal monthly operations and their cost of funds and generally follows the changes in the day treasury rates in increments divisible by and is payable in monthly installments through the interest rate resets monthly and was at october  this term loan is secured by certain of our agricultural properties 
term loan maturing october as of october   our wholly owned subsidiary  windfall investors  had million outstanding under the farm credit west term loan that matures in october we guaranteed payment of all indebtedness under this term loan and  in connection with our acquisition of windfall investors in november  began to include the results of operations and all of the assets and liabilities of windfall investors including the liabilities under this term loan in our consolidated financial statements 
the interest rate on this term loan was fixed at until november effective november  we entered into an agreement with farm credit west fixing the interest rate at for three years after which time the rate becomes variable at a rate equal to an internally calculated rate based on farm credit west s internal monthly operations and their cost of funds and generally follows the changes in the day treasury rates in increments divisible by until the loan matures 
this term loan is secured by the windfall farms property 
farm credit west line of credit maturing may on may   we entered into a new non revolving line of credit facility with farm credit west the new loan agreement  replacing the existing non revolving line of credit 
the terms of the new loan agreement are substantially similar to the existing line of credit including a commitment of  and monthly interest only payments at a variable rate  which was as of october  the new loan agreement extends the maturity date from may until may  removes windfall farms  llc as a borrower under the agreement and requires us to remit to farm credit west special principal payments of a minimum of  per lot sold on the windfall investors  llc real estate development project 
as of october   we had million outstanding under the farm credit west line of credit that matures may the farm credit west term loans and farm credit west line of credit contain various conditions  covenants and requirements with which our company and windfall investors must comply 
in addition  our company and windfall investors are subject to limitations on  among other things  selling  abandoning or ceasing business operations  merging or consolidating with a third party  disposing of a substantial portion of assets by sale  transfer  gifts or lease except for inventory sales in the ordinary course of business  obtaining credit or loans from other lenders other than trade credit customary in the business  becoming a guarantor or surety on or otherwise liable for the debts or obligations of a third party  and mortgaging  pledging  leasing for over a year  or otherwise making or allowing the filing of a lien on any collateral 
interest rate swaps we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage the risks and costs associated with our financing activities 
on april   we cancelled two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million each and amended the remaining interest rate swap from a notional amount of million to a notional amount of million 
at october   we had an interest rate swap agreement which locks in the interest rate on million of million in debt at approximately until june of the remaining million in debt  million bears interest at a variable rate  which was or less at october  and million bears interest at a fixed rate of which becomes variable in november our interest rate swaps previously qualified as cash flow hedges and the fair value adjustments to the swap agreements were deferred and included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as a result of the re negotiated terms  the remaining interest rate swap no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and accordingly  fair value adjustments from april  are included in interest expense 
in november  we entered into a forward interest swap agreement with rabobank international  utrecht to fix the interest rate at on million of our outstanding borrowings under the rabobank credit facility beginning on july  until june  additional information regarding the interest rate swaps can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
real estate development activities and related capital resources as noted under transactions affecting liquidity and capital resources  we have the ability to control the timing of our investing cash flows to the extent necessary based upon our liquidity demands 
in order for our real estate development operations to reach their maximum potential benefit to us  however  we will need to be successful over time in identifying other third party sources of capital to partner with us to move those development projects forward 
while we are frequently in discussions with potential external sources of capital in respect to all of our development projects  current market conditions for california real estate projects  while improving  continue to be challenging and make it difficult to predict the timing and amounts of future capital that will be required to complete the development of our projects 
trend information agribusiness the worldwide fresh produce industry has historically enjoyed consistent underlying demand and favorable growth dynamics 
in recent years  the market for fresh produce has increased faster than the rate of population growth  supported by ongoing trends including greater consumer demand for healthy  fresh and convenient foods  increased retailer square footage devoted to fresh produce  and greater emphasis on fresh produce as a differentiating factor in attracting customers 
health conscious consumers are driving much of the growth in demand for fresh produce 
over the past several decades  the benefits of natural  preservative free foods have become an increasingly significant element of the public dialogue on health and nutrition 
as a result  consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables has markedly increased 
according to the usda  americans consumed an additional pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables per capita in than they did in the usda reports that per capita fresh lemon consumption was pounds in and since has averaged pounds per capita versus pounds in the s 
the usda forecasts the us lemon crop at  tons  an increase of compared to and lemon prices are expected to decline due to the increase in domestic supplies 
california is expected to produce  tons of the us lemon crop in  with approximately of the crop historically going to the fresh market in the past decade 
the fresh market is significantly more profitable than the processed market and the amount of production sold in the fresh market is referred to as fresh utilization 
our fresh utilization has historically been comparable to the california industry average and we expect that our fresh utilization will increase due to increased flexibility to sell lemons directly to food service wholesale and retail customers and increased customer interaction resulting from our direct lemon sales strategy 
according to the usda  the us per capita consumption of avocados has increased in recent years from pounds per capita in to pounds per capita in initial usda estimates place consumption at a record pounds per capita in a growing hispanic population  an increasing awareness of healthier foods and the acceptance of mono unsaturated fats has helped to spur demand for avocados 
california is the largest us producer of avocados and the crop of million pounds was the second largest in the last ten years and fourth largest in california avocado production history 
despite a larger than average crop in  initial indications from industry sources suggest california avocado production will be another big one in indications also point to a bumper harvest in mexico in  with projected increased exports to the united states 
barring any weather abnormalities  ample supplies in california and mexico will likely enable retailers to aggressively promote avocados in  likely putting downward pressure on avocado prices 
the usda forecast has california s all orange crop up less than from last season s million tons 
the increase in navel production will just offset the nearly decline in valencia production  to total million tons 
the slight increase in california orange production should keep prices stable 
real estate development according to most accounts  the residential real estate market continues to be weak following the well known economic downturn in recent years 
persistent high unemployment is expected to keep home sales at historically low levels in terms of volume and price 
we have incurred impairment charges on certain of our real estate development projects over the last three years and future impairment is possible 
due to these factors  we anticipate maintaining a cautious and patient perspective with respect to our real estate development activities 
however  interest rates are also at historically low levels  which provide a favorable buying opportunity for potential home buyers 
additionally  we believe that our real estate development properties have certain unique characteristics and are located in desirable locations  in particular east area i  and as economic or real estate market conditions improve or other factors arise  we will take advantage of such opportunities to develop our properties 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents our contractual obligations at october  for which cash flows are fixed and determinable payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years fixed rate debt principal    variable rate debt principal   operating lease obligations   total contractual obligations   interest payments on fixed and variable rate debt  we believe that the cash flows from our agribusiness and rental operations segments as well as available borrowing capacity from our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our future capital expenditure  debt service  working capital and other contractual obligations for fiscal year in addition  we have the ability to control a portion of our investing cash flows to the extent necessary based on our liquidity demands 
fixed rate and variable rate debt details of amounts included in long term debt can be found above and in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the table above assumes that long term debt is held to maturity 
interest payments on fixed and variable debt the above table assumes that our fixed rate and long term debt is held to maturity and the interest rates on our variable rate debt remains unchanged for the remaining life of the debt from those in effect at october  preferred stock dividends in  in connection with the acquisition of ronald michaelis ranches  inc  we issued  shares of series b convertible preferred stock at par value the series b stock 
the holders of the series b stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of of par value 
such dividends are payable quarterly on the first day of january  april  july and october in each year commencing july  and totaled million in each of the fiscal years  and defined benefit pension plan we have a noncontributory  defined benefit  single employer pension plan the plan  which provides retirement benefits for all eligible employees of the company 
effective june  the company froze the plan and no additional benefits accrued to participants subsequent to that date 
we may make discretionary contributions to the plan and we may be required to make contributions to adhere to applicable regulatory funding provisions  based in part on the plan s asset valuations and underlying actuarial assumptions 
there were funding contributions of  and  for fiscal years and  respectively and we expect to contribute approximately  to the plan in fiscal year operating lease obligations we have numerous operating lease commitments with remaining terms ranging from less than one year to ten years 
we have installed a one mega watt photovoltaic solar array on one of our agricultural properties located in ventura county that produces a significant amount of the power to run our lemon packinghouse 
the construction of this array was financed by farm credit leasing and we have a long term lease with farm credit leasing for this array 
annual payments for this lease are million  and at the end of ten years we have an option to purchase the array for million 
we entered into a similar transaction with farm credit leasing for a second photovoltaic array at one of our agricultural properties located in the san joaquin valley to supply a significant amount of the power to operate four deep water well pumps located on our property 
annual lease payments for this facility range from million to million  and at the end of ten years we have the option to purchase the array for million 
additionally  we have agreements with an electricity utility through the california solar initiative which entitle us to receive rebates for energy produced by our solar arrays 
these rebates  which reduce our agribusiness costs and expenses  are scheduled to expire in fiscal year  were million  million and million in fiscal years   and  respectively  and have averaged approximately million per year since the inception of the leases 
we lease pollination equipment under a lease through with annual payments of million 
we also lease machinery and equipment for our packing operations under leases with annual lease commitments that are individually immaterial 
in january  we entered into six operating leases for the sheldon ranch 
each of the leases is for ten year terms and provides for four five year renewal options with an aggregate base rent of approximately  per year 
the leases also contain profit share arrangements with the landowners as additional rent on each of the properties and a provision for the potential purchase of the properties by us in the future 
due to the timing of the growing and harvesting seasons and as a result that the farming costs associated with the leased property were incurred by the lessor prior to lease commencement  we did not share in the citrus crop revenue in fiscal year we incurred  of net lease expense in fiscal year significant accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of accounts receivable  cultural costs  long lived assets including real estate development assets and property  plant and equipment  income taxes  retirement benefits  valuation of derivative instruments and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of significant accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to significant accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounts receivable we grant credit in the course of our operations to cooperatives  companies and lessees of our facilities 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
we provide allowances on our receivables as required based on accounts receivable aging and other factors 
cultural costs growing costs  also referred to as cultural costs  consist of orchard maintenance costs such as cultivation  fertilization and soil amendments  pest control  pruning and irrigation 
harvest costs are comprised of labor and equipment expenses incurred to harvest and deliver crops to the packinghouses 
lemons  oranges  specialty citrus and other crops such as pistachio nuts  cherries and olives are grown in our san joaquin valley orchards 
these crops have distinct growing periods and distinct harvest and selling periods  each of which lasts approximately four to six months 
during the growing period  cultural costs are capitalized as they are associated with benefiting and preparing the crops for the harvest and selling period 
during the harvest and selling period  harvest costs and cultural costs are expensed when incurred and capitalized cultural costs are amortized as components of agribusiness costs and expenses 
we primarily grow lemons and avocados in our ventura county orchards 
due to climate  growing conditions and the types of crops grown  the ventura county orchards may be harvested and sold on a more year round basis 
accordingly  we do not capitalize cultural costs associated with our ventura county orchards and therefore such costs  as well as harvest costs associated with the ventura county orchards  are expensed to operations when incurred as components of agribusiness costs and expenses 
most cultural costs  including amortization of capitalized cultural costs  and harvest costs are associated with and charged to specific crops 
certain other costs  such as property taxes  indirect labor including farm supervision and management and irrigation that benefit multiple crops are allocated to crops on a per acre basis 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including our definite life intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value of that asset  a write down is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
derivative instruments we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item  providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting 
if a derivative instrument is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting  or contracts for which we have not elected hedge accounting  are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of change 
retirement benefits we have a defined benefit pension plan that  effective june  was frozen to new participants and no additional benefits accrue to participants subsequent to that date 
the accounting and reporting for the plan requires assumptions and estimates regarding fair value and estimated return of plan assets and estimated benefit obligations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to develop critical accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  available relevant data and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as new or additional information become available in future periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition as a general policy  revenue and related costs are recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii selling price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we record a sales allowance in the period revenue is recognized as a provision for estimated customer discounts and concessions 
agribusiness revenue revenue from lemon sales is generally recognized fob shipping point when the customer takes possession of the fruit from our packing house 
revenue from the sales of certain of our agricultural products is recorded based on estimated proceeds provided by certain of our sales and marketing partners calavo and other third party packinghouses due to the time between when the product is delivered by us and the closing of the pools for such fruits at the end of each month 
calavo and other third party packinghouses are agricultural cooperatives or function in a similar manner as an agricultural cooperative 
as such  we apply specific authoritative agriculture revenue recognition guidance related to transactions between patrons and agriculture marketing cooperatives to record revenue at time of delivery to the packinghouses relating to fruits that are in pools that have not yet closed at month end if i the related fruits have been delivered to and accepted by calavo and other third party packinghouses ie title has transferred to calavo and other third party packinghouses and ii sales price information has been provided by calavo and other third party packinghouses based on the marketplace activity for the related fruit to estimate with reasonable certainty the final selling price for the fruit upon the closing of the pools 
historically  the revenue that is recorded based on the sales price information provided to us by calavo and other third party packinghouses at the time of delivery have not materially differed from the actual amounts that are paid after the monthly pools are closed 
our avocados  oranges  specialty citrus and other specialty crops are packed and sold by calavo and other third party packinghouses 
specifically  we deliver all of our avocado production from our orchards to calavo 
these avocados are then packed by calavo at its packinghouse  and sold and distributed under calavo brands to its customers primarily in the united states and canada 
our arrangements with other third party packinghouses related to our oranges  specialty citrus and other specialty crops are similar to our arrangement with calavo 
our arrangements with third party packinghouses are such that we are the producer and supplier of the product and the third party packinghouses are our customers 
the revenues we recognize related to the fruits sold to the third party packinghouses are based on the volume and quality of the fruits delivered  and the market price for such fruit  less the packinghouses charges to pack and market the fruit 
such packinghouse charges include the grading  sizing  packing  cooling  ripening and marketing of the related fruit 
we bear inventory risk until the product is delivered to the third party packinghouses at which time title and inventory risk to the product is transferred to the third party packinghouses and revenue is recognized 
such third party packinghouse charges are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on the application of specific authoritative revenue recognition guidance related to a vendor s income statement characterization of consideration given to a customer 
the identifiable benefit we receive from the third party packinghouses for packaging and marketing services cannot be sufficiently separated from the third party packinghouses purchase of our products 
in addition  we are not able to reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received from the third party packinghouses for such services and  as such  these costs are characterized as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
revenue from crop insurance proceeds is recorded when the amount of and the right to receive the payment can be reasonably determined 
we recorded agribusiness revenues from crop insurance proceeds related to avocados of   and zero in fiscal years  and  respectively 
rental revenue minimum rental revenues are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the respective initial lease term 
contingent rental revenues are contractually defined as to the percentage of rent received by us and are based on fees collected by the lessee 
our rental arrangements generally require payment on a monthly or quarterly basis 
real estate development revenue we recognize revenue on real estate development projects in accordance with fasb asc  real estate sales  which provides for profit to be recognized in full when real estate is sold  provided that a sale has been consummated and profit is determinable  collection of sales proceeds is estimable with the seller s receivable not subject to subordination  risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and the earnings process is substantially complete with no significant seller activities or obligations required after the date of sale 
to the extent the above conditions are not met  a portion or all of the profit is deferred 
incidental operations may occur during the holding or development period of real estate development projects to reduce holding or development costs 
incremental revenue from incidental operations in excess of incremental costs from incidental operations is accounted for as a reduction of development costs 
incremental costs from incidental operations in excess of incremental revenue from incidental operations are charged to operations 
real estate development costs we capitalize the planning  entitlement  construction and development costs associated with our various real estate projects 
costs that are not capitalized are expensed as incurred 
a real estate development project is considered substantially complete upon the cessation of construction and development activities 
once a project is substantially completed  future costs are expensed as incurred 
for fiscal year  we capitalized approximately million of costs related to our real estate projects and expensed approximately million of costs 
for fiscal year  we capitalized approximately million of costs related to real estate development and expensed approximately million 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
such deferred income tax asset and liability computations are based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
tax benefits from an uncertain tax position are only recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to interest rates as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
contract terms of our hedge instruments closely mirror those of the hedged item  providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts that are effective at meeting the risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting 
if a derivative instrument is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting  or contracts for which we have not elected hedge accounting  are valued at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of change 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets including our real estate development projects for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
as a result of the economic downturn  in recent years we recorded impairment charges of zero  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these charges were based on independent  third party appraisals provided to us and were developed using various facts  assumption and estimates 
future changes in these facts  assumptions and estimates could result in additional charges 
defined benefit retirement plan as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we sponsor a defined benefit retirement plan that was frozen in june  and no future benefits accrued to participants subsequent to that time 
ongoing accounting for this plan under fasb asc provides guidance as to  among other things  future estimated pension expense  minimum pension liability and future minimum funding requirements 
this information is provided to us by third party actuarial consultants 
in developing this data  certain estimates and assumptions are used  including among other things  discount rate  long term rates of return and mortality tables 
changes in any of these estimates could materially affect the amounts recorded that are related to our defined benefit retirement plan 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements financial accounting standards board accounting standards update fasb asu  fair value measurement topic 
in may  the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which amends asc  fair value measurement 
the amended guidance changes the wording used to describe many requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
additionally  the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the guidance provided in asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
our adoption of these provisions in the third quarter of fiscal year did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements fasb asu  comprehensive income topic 
in june  the fasb issued guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the updated guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic  to defer the effective date for those aspects of asu relating to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the adoption of this standard will only impact the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and will have no impact on the reported results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk borrowings under each of the rabobank credit facility  farm credit west term loans and the farm credit west line of credit are or will be subject to variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates subject us to the risk of increased interest costs associated with any upward movements in interest rates 
our borrowing interest rate for the rabobank credit facility is a libor based rate plus a spread 
under the farm credit west term loans and the farm credit west line of credit  our borrowing interest rate is an internally calculated rate based on farm credit west s internal monthly operations and their cost of funds and generally follows the changes in the day treasury rates in increments divisible by 
at october   our total debt outstanding under the farm credit west term loans was approximately million  million and million for each of the three term loans  respectively 
at october   our total debt outstanding under the rabobank credit facility and the farm credit west line of credit was million and million  respectively 
we manage our exposure to interest rate movements by utilizing interest rate swaps derivatives 
we fixed million and million of our outstanding borrowings with fixed to floating interest rate swaps as described in the following table notional amount fair value net liability october  october  october  october  pay fixed rate  receive floating rate interest rate swap  maturing pay fixed rate  receive floating rate forward interest rate swap  beginning july until june  as of october   the fixed interest rate on our million swap was 
based on our level of borrowings at october   after taking into consideration the effects of our interest rate swaps derivatives  a increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense million for fiscal year and an annual average of million for the three subsequent fiscal years 
additionally  a increase in the interest rate would decrease our net income by million for fiscal year and an annual average of million for the three subsequent fiscal years
