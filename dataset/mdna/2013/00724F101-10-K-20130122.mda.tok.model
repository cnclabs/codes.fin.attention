acquisitions on january   we completed the acquisition of privately held efficient frontier  a multi channel digital ad buying and optimization company 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we began integrating efficient frontier into our digital marketing segment  however  the impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations 
during fiscal  we completed six business combinations and two asset acquisitions with aggregate purchase prices totaling approximately million 
we have included the financial results of the business combinations in our consolidated results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates  however  the impact of these acquisitions was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations

see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  stock based compensation  business combinations  goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the licensing of perpetual and time based software products  associated software maintenance and support plans  non software related hosting services  consulting services  training and technical support 
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software  upgrades  maintenance and support  hosting services  and consulting 
for our software and software related multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  and allocate the total price among the various elements 
vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements 
absent vsoe  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
however  if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support services  custom software development services  consulting services and training 
for multiple element arrangements containing our non software services  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of fair value  third party evidence tpe or best estimated selling price besp  as applicable  and allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method 
for multiple element arrangements that contain software and non software elements such as our hosted offerings  we allocate revenue to software or software related elements as a group and any non software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use its besp for that deliverable 
once revenue is allocated to software or software related elements as a group  it follows historic software accounting guidance 
revenue is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
when we are unable to establish selling prices using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non software elements and as such  we use besp 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to major product groupings  geographies  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives and pricing practices 
significant pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices  volume discounts where applicable and our price lists 

table of contents we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns  price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded 
in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
product returns may be more or less than what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
there could be a delay in the release of our products 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
in the future  actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
we recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term 
over usage fees  and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data  are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred 
we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures  such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
in fiscal  the executive compensation committee of adobe board of directors eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees and stock option grants to non employee directors were minimal 
in lieu of stock options  we granted restricted stock units as the primary form of equity awards to employees 
stock option grants prior to fiscal continue to vest over the requisite service period and had a material impact to stock based compensation cost for fiscal and are expected to have a material impact to stock based compensation cost until the majority of stock options are fully vested 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan espp shares 
this fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  the expected term of the awards  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
we use a month expected term  which approximates our offering period 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense for espp shares in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures for both espp shares and existing stock option grants that continue 
table of contents to vest  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assumed equity awards  as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  subscriptions  support agreements  consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed 
the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold 
if the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee s exercise behavior  then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company s history 
otherwise  our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold 
zero coupon yields implied by us treasury issuances  implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  during the second quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal and determined there was no impairment 
the results of our annual impairment test indicate there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and 
table of contents liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
in addition  we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities  including a current examination by the irs for our fiscal and tax returns 
these examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we are a united states based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries 
in addition to providing for us income taxes on earnings from the us  we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the us while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings  if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated  the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings 
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the us federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned  by changes in  or our interpretation of  tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business  by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates  by lapses of the availability of the us research and development tax credit  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements there have been no new accounting pronouncements made effective during the year ended november   that are of significance  or potential significance  to us 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance  or potential significance  to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations overview of effective in the first quarter of fiscal  we modified our segments due to changes in how we operate our business 
we combined our creative and interactive solutions segment with our digital media solutions segment and our knowledge worker segment  and named it digital media 
we also renamed our omniture segment to digital marketing and combined it with our enterprise segment 
these changes reflect our focus on our two strategic growth opportunities 
our print and publishing segment  which contains many of our mature products and solutions  continues to be reported as it was in fiscal and see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further segment and geographical information 
prior year information below has been updated to reflect these changes 
for fiscal  we reported solid financial results and executed against our two strategic growth areas  digital media and digital marketing  while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions 
in may  we launched adobe creative suite cs which is at the center of adobe creative cloud  our new subscription based offering for creating and publishing content and applications that was also released in may the launch of cs included major updates to all of our core creative suite cs point products as well as four suite versions 
over time  
table of contents we expect creative cloud to transform our business model and drive higher revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry  as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release 
we anticipate accelerated adoption of creative cloud in fiscal  which we expect will cause our traditional perpetual license revenue and  in turn  total net revenues in fiscal  to decline 
during this transition we do not anticipate a corresponding decrease in expenses  which we believe will adversely affect our net income and operating margin in fiscal however  over time we expect this business model transition will significantly increase our long term revenue growth rate by attracting new users  keeping our end user base current and thereby driving higher average revenue per user 
additionally  our shift to a subscription model will increase the amount of our recurring revenue that is ratably reported  driven by broader creative cloud adoption over the next several years 
we plan to continue to offer the perpetual licensing model as we transition our customers to this new subscription based model 
to assist with the understanding of this transition and the related shift in revenue described above  we have introduced the use of certain performance metrics which we will use to assess the health and trajectory of our overall digital media segment 
these metrics include the total number of paid  active subscribers and annualized recurring revenue arr 
we define arr as the sum of the number of paid  active subscribers  multiplied by the average subscription price paid per user per month  multiplied by twelve months  plus  twelve months of contract value of enterprise term license agreements etlas where the revenue is ratably recognized over the life of the contract 
in addition  we expect renewal rates associated with creative cloud  and potentially other subscription offerings  will become key metrics used to measure their performance 
because the majority of creative cloud subscriptions have been annual and the creative cloud launched in may  we have not yet reached the first anniversary of these annual subscriptions and  therefore  we anticipate that meaningful data regarding subscription renewal rates will first become available later in fiscal year financial performance summary for fiscal we continue to derive the majority of our revenue from perpetual licenses 
however  our subscription revenue  as a percentage of total revenue  has increased to in fiscal from approximately and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as we transition more of our business to a subscription based model 
our total revenue of billion increased million and million  or and  from billion and billion in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the continued success of our adobe marketing cloud and creative suite family of products 
cost of revenue and operating expenses of billion increased by million and million  or and  from billion and billion in fiscal and  respectively 
these increases are primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount 
income before income taxes of billion increased by million and million  or and  from billion and million in fiscal and  respectively 
net income of million remained stable compared to fiscal and increased million  or  from million in fiscal net cash flow from operations of billion remained stable compared to fiscal and increased million  or  from billion in fiscal primarily due to increases in net income and deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables from increased cash collections

segment information dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal change change digital media percentage of total revenue digital marketing percentage of total revenue print and publishing percentage of total revenue total revenue 
table of contents fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue digital media revenue from digital media remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to solid demand for our acrobat family of products as well as the continued momentum of the cs launch in the second quarter of fiscal  offset by better than expected growth associated with our subscription offerings 
revenue related to our creative professional products  which included our creative suite editions and cs point products as well as the recently released creative cloud  decreased slightly during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher than expected customer adoption of creative cloud and point product subscriptions 
we anticipate accelerated adoption of creative cloud and point product subscriptions  for which revenue is recognized over time  and that this adoption will cause our traditional perpetual license revenue to decline 
the decreases in revenue associated with our creative professional products were offset in part by growth associated with the may release of new photoshop point products for which the previous release occurred in fiscal revenue associated with our other creative products increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increases associated with third party toolbar distribution via flash player downloads as well as continued demand related to the may release of adobe lightroom for our creative offerings  the total number of perpetual units licensed remained relatively stable while the number of subscription units licensed increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal unit average selling prices  excluding subscriptions  decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal document services revenue  which includes our acrobat product family  also increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased document exchange services revenue including revenue generated from our echosign esignatures service and the launch of adobe acrobat xi in the fourth quarter of fiscal within document services  excluding large enterprise license agreement deals  the number of units licensed remained relatively stable while the unit average selling prices increased for our acrobat offerings for fiscal as compared to fiscal digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased million  or during fiscal when compared to fiscal  primarily due to continued growth of our adobe marketing cloud  which increased year over year and includes our adobe cq wem offerings and revenue generated from products associated with our recent acquisition of efficient frontier 
also contributing to the growth in revenue was our adobe connect hosted offering 
as expected  increases in these areas were offset in part by a decrease in revenue associated with adobe livecycle product offerings as we continue to shift our focus to our adobe marketing cloud including our wem solution 
print and publishing revenue from print and publishing remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to decreases in legacy product revenue  offset by increases in fees received for consulting services and royalties related to postscript products 
fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue digital media revenue from digital media increased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the year over year increase in revenue was driven by continued licensing of the cs product family 
revenue related to our creative professional products  which included our creative suite editions and cs point products  increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in suite revenue associated with our master collection  and to a lesser extent  our design and video authoring suites 
also contributing to the growth was an increase in revenue associated with our illustrator and indesign point products 
revenue associated with our other creative products increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increases associated with third party toolbar distribution via adobe reader and flash player downloads as well as our digital publishing solution which was made available to all enterprise customers during fiscal 
table of contents for our creative offerings  both the total number of units licensed and unit average selling prices remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal document services revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal we attribute this success to strong adoption of our acrobat x product  which was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal as compared to fiscal  unit average selling prices for document services increased and the number of units licensed remained relatively stable 
digital marketing revenue from digital marketing increased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to continued customer adoption of our adobe marketing cloud  which includes our wem offerings resulting from the acquisition of day  which closed late in the fourth quarter of fiscal print and publishing revenue from print and publishing decreased million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower shockwave revenue and the release of coldfusion at the end of fiscal for which a comparable release did not occur in the current year 
also contributing to the decline was a one time large deal in adobe captivate and our tech communications products during fiscal that did not recur in fiscal geographical information dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal change change americas percentage of total revenue emea percentage of total revenue apac percentage of total revenue total revenue fiscal revenue by geography compared to fiscal revenue by geography overall revenue for fiscal increased in the americas and apac and declined slightly in emea when compared to fiscal revenue in the americas increased during fiscal primarily due to revenue increases in digital media and digital marketing  offset slightly by a decline in print and publishing revenue 
despite the launch of cs in may  the current economic conditions in europe and the weakening of the euro and british pound against the us dollar caused revenue in emea to decline slightly during fiscal compared with fiscal revenue in apac increased across all reportable segments during fiscal as compared with fiscal within each geographical region  the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above 
fiscal revenue by geography compared to fiscal revenue by geography overall revenue for fiscal increased in each of the geographic regions when compared to fiscal within each geographic region  every reportable segment contributed to the increase in revenue with the exception of print and publishing  which experienced decreases in emea and apac 
the increase in revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal in the americas  emea and apac was attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above 

table of contents included in the overall increase in revenue for fiscal and fiscal were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below 
our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue

this decrease was offset in part by the favorable impact to revenue measured in japanese yen and other asian currencies as the us dollar weakened against these currencies 
our emea and yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal as noted in the table above 
during fiscal  the euro  british pound and other emea currencies were favorably impacted as the us dollar weakened against these currencies causing revenue in emea measured in average us dollar equivalents to increase compared to fiscal revenue measured in both the japanese yen and other currencies also were favorably impacted as the us dollar weakened against these currencies 
during fiscal  our emea and japanese yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains as noted above

product backlog the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects 
shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders  excluding those associated with new product releases  those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy 
we had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect that our shippable backlog will continue to be insignificant in future periods

cost of product revenue decreased due to the following change change cost of sales excess and obsolete inventory amortization of purchased intangibles royalty cost various individually insignificant items total change cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to decrease in cost of sales and amortization of purchase intangibles  offset by increases in excess and obsolete inventory 
cost of sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in packaging costs associated with our cs products 
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased primarily due to certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisitions in prior years that were fully amortized in fiscal excess and obsolete inventory increased primarily due to increased reserve requirements for adobe creative suite and adobe creative suite products necessitated by the launch of cs in the second quarter of fiscal cost of product revenue decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to decrease in royalty costs  offset by increase in amortization of purchase intangibles 
royalty costs decreased primarily due to a decrease in obligations to certain key vendors 
amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through acquisitions during fiscal and our day acquisition in the fourth quarter of subscription cost of subscription revenue consists of expenses related to operating our network infrastructure  including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment  data center costs  salaries and related expenses of network operations  implementation  account management and technical support personnel  amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead 
we enter into contracts with third parties for the use of their data center facilities and our data center costs largely consist of the amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space  power and similar items

amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to increased amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of efficient frontier in the first quarter of fiscal hosted server costs increased primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and hosting expenses associated with the launch of our creative cloud services in the second quarter of fiscal also contributing to the increase in hosted server costs is the increase in depreciation expense from higher capital expenditures in prior years and data center costs related to higher transaction volumes in our adobe marketing cloud services and creative cloud 
cost of subscription revenue remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to decreased amortization of purchased intangibles resulting from certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of omniture that were fully amortized in fiscal this was offset in part by increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and increases in data center costs related to higher transaction volumes in our adobe marketing cloud services

provision for income taxes dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal change change provision percentage of total revenue effective tax rate our effective tax rate increased by approximately six percentage points during fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  the increase was primarily related to the expiration of the us research and development credit  as well as tax benefits associated with a favorable state income tax ruling and tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to adobe trading companies 
our effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to tax costs of licensing acquired company assets to adobe trading companies 
these costs were partially offset by tax benefits related to a favorable state income tax ruling and the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit 
in january  the united states congress passed an extension of the federal research and development tax credit through december  as a result  we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal will include a discrete tax benefit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent the effective annual tax rate 
we are a united states based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries 
in addition to providing for us income taxes on earnings from the us  we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the us while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings  if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated  the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings 
currently  there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at november  was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
if the total unrecognized tax benefits at november  were recognized in the future  million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate  which is net of an estimated million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future state tax returns 
as of november   the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately million 
this amount is included in non current income taxes payable 
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process 
these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non current assets and liabilities 
we believe that within the next months  it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire  or both 
given the uncertainties described above  we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from to approximately million

other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program  which is described below  business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities of billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non cash items 
the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and decreases in trade receivables 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to an increase in activity for both upgrade plans with support and site and term licenses largely associated with our digital media and digital marketing enterprise license agreements 
the decrease in trade receivables is primarily related to an increase in revenue linearity and improved collections in our digital marketing portfolio offset in part by higher revenue levels due to the cs product release which occurred late in the second quarter of fiscal the primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accrued restructuring and trade payables 
decreases in accrued restructuring primarily related to payments and adjustments for employee terminations and facility exit costs associated with the fiscal restructuring plan  a significant portion of which were paid and adjusted in the first and second quarters of fiscal trade payables decreased primarily due to the timing of payments as a greater number of invoices were paid prior to the fiscal year end in fiscal as compared to fiscal for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities of billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non cash items 
the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued restructuring

trade receivables increased primarily as a result of overall higher sales levels and billing occurring during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal  offset in part by an increased rate of collection for digital marketing services 
decreases in accrued expenses were primarily related to lower accrued bonus levels in fiscal  coupled with payment of our second and third semi annual interest payments associated with our notes totaling million 
the resulting reduction in accrued interest was partially offset by additional interest accruals made during the period 
taxes payable decreased primarily due to the resolution of a canadian tax audit offset in part by quarterly increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid 

table of contents for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities of billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non cash items 
the primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal annual incentive plan and interest on our notes  both of which were paid in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we made our first semi annual interest payment associated with our notes totaling million 
the resulting reduction in accrued interest was partially offset by additional interest accruals made during the period 
increases in deferred revenue related primarily to activity from our acquisition of omniture  the related renewal of calendar year based contracts in addition to increases in maintenance and support orders and royalty revenue deferrals related to changes in customer billing terms 
the primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal were increases in trade receivables  prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as decreases in taxes payable  accrued restructuring and trade payables 
trade receivables increased as a result of products shipped and billed during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the launch of acrobat x and slower receivable payments pertaining to omniture services 
increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets related primarily to higher valuations on our cash flow and balance sheet hedges due to the strengthening of the us dollar 
income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments of approximately million for tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings as well as a million settlement of an irs exam in the fourth quarter of fiscal accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments made related to the fiscal restructuring plan that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition to adjustments made to previously recorded estimates  offset in part by new charges

other uses of cash during fiscal were for treasury stock repurchases offset in part by proceeds from our treasury stock issuances 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including short term and long term investments  venture capital  facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  product support and administrative staff 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies  products or technologies that are complementary to our business

see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our restructuring plans 
other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal due to changes in our planned cash outlay  including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our business acquisitions 
our cash and investments totaled billion as of november  of this amount  approximately was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects 
our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations  and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations 
in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if us tax has not already been previously provided  we would provide for and pay additional us taxes in connection with repatriating these funds 
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
as of november   the amount outstanding under our senior notes was billion 
on march   we entered into a five year billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement  providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries 
as of november   there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire billion credit line remains available for borrowing

stock repurchase program during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved an amendment to our stock repurchase program authorized in april from a non expiring share based authority to a time constrained dollar based authority 
as part of this amendment  the board of directors granted authority to repurchase up to billion in common stock through the end of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we exhausted our billion time constrained dollar based authority granted by our board of directors in fiscal in april  the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting authority to repurchase up to billion in common stock through the end of fiscal the new stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors is similar to our previous billion stock repurchase program 
during fiscal  and  we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions  whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling million  million and million  respectively

we enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price vwap of our common stock over a specified period of time 
we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions 
there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases 
under the terms of the agreements  there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us 
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term 
the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the contract  the number of trading days in the contract  the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price per share of through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal and fiscal for fiscal  and  the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date  though only shares physically delivered to us by november   december  and december  were excluded from the computation of earnings per share

capital lease obligation in june  we entered into a sale leaseback agreement to sell equipment totaling million and leaseback the same equipment over a period of months 
this transaction was classified as a capital lease obligation and was recorded at fair value 
covenants our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
our almaden tower lease includes certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly 
as of november   we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
we believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
our notes do not contain any financial covenants 
under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements  we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at november  was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process 
these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non current assets and liabilities 
we believe that within the next months  it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire  or both 
given the uncertainties described above  we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from to approximately million 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 

table of contents guarantees the lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
as such  we recognized million and million in liabilities  related to the extended east and west towers and almaden tower leases  respectively 
the balance was amortized to our consolidated statements of income over the life of the original leases 
as of november  there was no remaining balance of the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees  for either lease  remaining on our consolidated balance sheets 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time  we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director or officer lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency risk foreign currency hedging instruments in countries outside the us  we transact business in us dollars and various other currencies which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates 
we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
additionally  we may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts to hedge our euro  yen  or british pound denominated revenue 
our revenue exposures for fiscal  and were as follows in millions  except yen fiscal fiscal fiscal euro yen in billions british pounds our european operating expenses are primarily in euro and our japanese operating expenses are primarily in yen  which naturally mitigates a portion of the exposure related to our euro and yen denominated product revenue 
we hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and or forward contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
in addition  we hedge our net monetary assets and liabilities using forward contracts 
these contracts subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
as of november   the total absolute value of outstanding contracts was million which included the notional equivalent of million in euro  million in yen and million in other foreign currencies 
these hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue 
as of november   all contracts were set to expire at various times through june the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk  we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional currency foreign subsidiaries 
as of november  and december   this long term investment exposure 
table of contents totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time  we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro  yen  and british pound 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income  net on our consolidated statements of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended november   there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income  net 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at november   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of november  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries  revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities
