item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we are a leading provider of high speed fixed and mobile broadband services  advanced satellite and wireless networks and secure networking systems  products and services 
we have leveraged our success developing complex satellite communication systems and equipment for the us government and select commercial customers to develop next generation satellite broadband technologies and services for both fixed and mobile users 
our product  systems and broadband service offerings are often linked through common underlying technologies  customer applications and market relationships 
we believe that our portfolio of products and services  combined with our ability to effectively cross deploy technologies between government and commercial segments and across different geographic markets  provides us with a strong foundation to sustain and enhance our leadership in advanced communications and networking technologies 
viasat operates in three segments satellite services  commercial networks and government systems 
in july  we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the parent company of stonewood group limited stonewood  a privately held company registered in england and wales see note to our consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenues our satellite services segment revenues are primarily derived from our domestic satellite broadband services business and from our worldwide managed network services 
our domestic satellite broadband services business comprised approximately  and of total revenues during fiscal years  and  respectively 
with respect to our commercial networks and government systems segments  to date  our ability to grow and maintain our revenues has depended on our ability to identify and target markets where the customer places a high priority on the technology solution  and our ability to obtain additional sizable contract awards 
due to the nature of this process  it is difficult to predict the probability and timing of obtaining awards in these markets 
our products in these segments are provided primarily through three types of contracts fixed price  time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
fixed price contracts which require us to provide products and services under a contract at a specified price comprised approximately  and of our total revenues for these segments for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the remainder of our revenue in these segments for such periods was derived from cost reimbursement contracts under which we are reimbursed for all actual costs incurred in performing the contract to the extent such costs are within the contract ceiling and allowable under the terms of the contract  plus a fee or profit and from time and materials contracts which reimburse us for the number of labor hours expended at an established hourly rate negotiated in the contract  plus the cost of materials utilized in providing such products or services 

table of contents historically  a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customer contracts that include the research and development of products 
the research and development efforts are conducted in direct response to the customer s specific requirements and  accordingly  expenditures related to such efforts are included in cost of sales when incurred and the related funding which includes a profit component is included in revenues 
revenues for our funded research and development from our customer contracts were approximately million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  million or of our total revenues during fiscal year  and million or of our total revenues during fiscal year we also incur ir d expenses  which are not directly funded by a third party 
ir d expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  supplies  prototype materials  testing and certification related to research and development projects 
ir d expenses were approximately  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a government contractor  we are able to recover a portion of our ir d expenses pursuant to our government contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe the specific risks for these critical accounting policies in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from long term contracts requiring development and delivery of complex equipment built to customer specifications 
sales related to these contracts are accounted for under the authoritative guidance for the percentage of completion method of accounting accounting standards codification asc 
sales and earnings under these contracts are recorded either based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract  or as products are shipped under the units of delivery method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
for contract claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
during fiscal years  and  we recorded losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to loss contracts 

table of contents assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and future cost estimates or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
we believe we have established appropriate systems and processes to enable us to reasonably estimate future costs on our programs through regular evaluations of contract costs  scheduling and technical matters by business unit personnel and management 
historically  in the aggregate  we have not experienced significant deviations in actual costs from estimated program costs  and when deviations that result in significant adjustments arise  we disclose the related impact in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
however  these estimates require significant management judgment and a significant change in future cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on our results of operations 
a one percent variance in our future cost estimates on open fixed price contracts as of march  would change our loss before income taxes by approximately million 
we also derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts and purchase orders where revenue is recorded on delivery of products or performance of services in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition asc 
under this standard  we recognize revenue when an arrangement exists  prices are determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and the goods or services have been delivered 
we also enter into certain leasing arrangements with customers and evaluate the contracts in accordance with the authoritative guidance for leases asc 
our accounting for equipment leases involves specific determinations under the authoritative guidance for leases  which often involve complex provisions and significant judgments 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for leases  we classify the transactions as sales type or operating leases based on review for transfers of ownership of the equipment to the lessee by the end of the lease term  review of the lease terms to determine if it contains an option to purchase the leased equipment for a price which is sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the equipment at the date of the option  review of the lease term to determine if it is equal to or greater than of the economic life of the equipment  and review of the present value of the minimum lease payments to determine if they are equal to or greater than of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the lease 
additionally  we consider the cancelability of the contract and any related uncertainty of collections or risk in recoverability of the lease investment at lease inception 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease or when the equipment has been delivered and installed at the customer site  if installation is required 
revenues from equipment rentals under operating leases are recognized as earned over the lease term  which is generally on a straight line basis 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  the accounting standards update asu asu  revenue recognition asc multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which updates asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  of the financial accounting standards board fasb codification  for substantially all of the arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy at the arrangement inception 
the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available a description as to how we determine vsoe  tpe and esp is provided below 
if a tangible hardware systems product includes software  we determine whether the tangible hardware systems product and the software work together to deliver the product s essential functionality and  if so  the entire product is treated as a nonsoftware deliverable 
the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverables using the relative selling prices of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
revenue for each separate unit of accounting is recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria for each element have been met 
to determine the selling price in multiple element arrangements  we establish vsoe of the selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and for software license updates  product support 
table of contents and hardware systems support  based on the renewal rates offered to customers 
for nonsoftware multiple element arrangements  tpe is established by evaluating similar and or interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers and or agreements 
if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe doesn t exist  we determine esp for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transactions  including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices including discounting  margin objectives  competition  the geographies in which we offer our products and services  the type of customer ie distributor  value added reseller  government agency or direct end user  among others and the stage of the product lifecycle 
the determination of esp considers our pricing model and go to market strategy 
as our or our competitors pricing and go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes to our determination of vsoe  tpe and esp 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ materially from those in the current period 
collections in excess of revenues and deferred revenues represent cash collected from customers in advance of revenue recognition and are recorded in accrued liabilities for obligations within the next twelve months 
amounts for obligations extending beyond the twelve months are recorded within other liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
warranty reserves we provide limited warranties on our products for periods of up to five years 
we record a liability for our warranty obligations when we ship the products or they are included in long term construction contracts based upon an estimate of expected warranty costs 
amounts expected to be incurred within twelve months are classified as a current liability 
for mature products  we estimate the warranty costs based on historical experience with the particular product 
for newer products that do not have a history of warranty costs  we base our estimates on our experience with the technology involved and the types of failures that may occur 
it is possible that our underlying assumptions will not reflect the actual experience  and in that case  we will make future adjustments to the recorded warranty obligation 
property  equipment and satellites satellites and other property and equipment are recorded at cost or in the case of certain satellites and other property acquired  the fair value at the date of acquisition  net of accumulated depreciation 
capitalized satellite costs consist primarily of the costs of satellite construction and launch  including launch insurance and insurance during the period of in orbit testing  the net present value of performance incentives expected to be payable to the satellite manufacturers dependent on the continued satisfactory performance of the satellites  costs directly associated with the monitoring and support of satellite construction  and interest costs incurred during the period of satellite construction 
we also construct gateway facilities  network operations systems and other assets to support our satellites  and those construction costs  including interest  are capitalized as incurred 
at the time satellites are placed in service  we estimate the useful life of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite s performance against the original manufacturer s orbital design life  estimated fuel levels and related consumption rates  as well as historical satellite operating trends 
we own two satellites viasat our high capacity ka band spot beam satellite  which was successfully launched into orbit in october and commenced commercial operation in january and wildblue which was placed into service in march  and we recently announced the entry into a satellite construction contract for viasat  a second high capacity ka band satellite 
in addition  we have an exclusive prepaid lifetime capital lease of ka band capacity over the continental united states on telesat canada s anik f satellite which was placed into service in april and own related gateway and networking equipment on all of our satellites 
our property and equipment also include the cpe units leased to subscribers under a retail leasing program as part of our satellite services segment 

table of contents impairment of long lived and other long term assets property  equipment and satellites  and other assets  including goodwill in accordance with the authoritative guidance for impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets  including property  equipment and satellites and other assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the remaining estimated useful life of the satellite to determine if revisions to the estimated life are necessary 
we recognize an impairment loss when the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset or group of assets are less than the asset s carrying value 
any required impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value  and would be recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
no material impairments were recorded by us for fiscal years  and we account for our goodwill under the authoritative guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets asc and the provisions of asu  testing goodwill for impairment  which permits us to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if  after completing our qualitative assessment we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  we compare the fair value to our carrying value including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying value  we conclude that no impairment exists 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value  resulting in goodwill impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter every fiscal year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of changes in certain factors including changes in forecasted operating results and comparing actual results to projections  changes in the industry or our competitive environment since the acquisition date  changes in the overall economy  our market share and market interest rates since the acquisition date  trends in the stock price and related market capitalization and enterprise values  trends in peer companies total enterprise value metrics  and additional factors such as management turnover  changes in regulation and changes in litigation matters 
based on our qualitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value as of march  and  therefore  determined it was not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
income taxes and valuation allowance on deferred tax assets management evaluates the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes asc  net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets increased from million at march  to million at march  the valuation allowance primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards available to reduce state income taxes 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance considered the loss incurred during the fiscal year ended march  however  a substantial portion of the loss incurred in such period was the result of an extinguishment of debt charge that was recorded upon the refinancing of the notes with our additional notes  which were issued in october the additional notes  which is expected to provide a benefit to net income in the future due to the lower interest rate of the notes 
our evaluation considered other factors  including our history of positive earnings  taxable income 
table of contents adjusted for certain items  the significant growth in contractual backlog  and trends and forecasted income by jurisdiction 
consideration was also given to the lengthy period over which our net deferred tax assets can be realized  and our history of not having federal tax loss carryforwards expire unused 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes asc 
under the authoritative guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the authoritative guidance addresses the derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of business there are calculations and transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in addition  changes in tax laws and regulations as well as adverse judicial rulings could adversely affect the income tax provision 
we believe we have adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
however  if these provided amounts prove to be more than what is necessary  the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine that provision for the liabilities is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense would result

amortization of acquired intangible assets we amortize our acquired intangible assets from prior acquisitions over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years 
the decrease in amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately million in fiscal year compared to last fiscal year was a result of certain acquired technology intangibles in our commercial networks segment becoming fully amortized over the preceding twelve months 
expected amortization expense for acquired intangible assets for each of the following periods is as follows amortization in thousands expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year expected for fiscal year thereafter interest income interest income in fiscal year compared to fiscal year increased slightly as we experienced higher average invested cash balances  but slightly lower average interest rates on our investments during fiscal year compared to fiscal year interest expense the increase in interest expense year over year of approximately million was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and additional interest incurred on our initial notes  which were issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the initial notes

these segment operating profit improvements were offset by higher selling  support and new business proposal costs of approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year backlog as reflected in the table below  both firm and funded backlog increased in each of our segments during fiscal year due to certain large contract awards in our commercial networks segment  which we were pursuing in fiscal year and fiscal year  as well as growth in contract awards in the other two segments 
as of march  as of march  in millions firm backlog satellite services segment commercial networks segment government systems segment total funded backlog satellite services segment commercial networks segment government systems segment total 
table of contents the firm backlog does not include contract options 
of the million in firm backlog  approximately million is expected to be delivered in fiscal year  and the balance is expected to be delivered in fiscal year and thereafter 
we include in our backlog only those orders for which we have accepted purchase orders 
our total new awards were  million   million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
new contract awards in fiscal year were a record for us 
in fiscal year  we anticipate that contract awards  particularly in our government systems segment  may be negatively impacted by budget cuts  including sequestration by the us government 
for additional information  see risk factors our reliance on us government contracts exposes us to significant risks in item a of this report 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales 
a majority of our contracts can be terminated at the convenience of the customer 
orders are often made substantially in advance of delivery  and our contracts typically provide that orders may be terminated with limited or no penalties 
in addition  purchase orders may present product specifications that would require us to complete additional product development 
a failure to develop products meeting such specifications could lead to a termination of the related contract 
firm backlog amounts as presented are comprised of funded and unfunded components 
funded backlog represents the sum of contract amounts for which funds have been specifically obligated by customers to contracts 
unfunded backlog represents future amounts that customers may obligate over the specified contract performance periods 
our customers allocate funds for expenditures on long term contracts on a periodic basis 
our ability to realize revenues from contracts in backlog is dependent upon adequate funding for such contracts 
although we do not control the funding of our contracts  our experience indicates that actual contract fundings have ultimately been approximately equal to the aggregate amounts of the contracts 
liquidity and capital resources overview we have financed our operations to date primarily with cash flows from operations  bank line of credit financing  debt financing and equity financing 
at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
the general cash needs of our satellite services  commercial networks and government systems segments can vary significantly 
the cash needs of our satellite services segment tend to be driven primarily by the timing of payment of capital expenditures eg  payments under satellite construction and launch contracts and of network expansion activities  as well as the quality of customer  type of contract and payment terms 
in our commercial networks segment  cash needs tend to be driven primarily by the type and mix of contracts in backlog  the nature and quality of customers  the level of investments in ir d activities and the payment terms of customers including whether advance payments are made or customer financing is required 
in our government systems segment  the primary factors determining cash needs tend to be the type and mix of contracts in backlog eg  product or service  development or production and timing of payments including restrictions on the timing of cash payments under us government procurement regulations 
other factors affecting the cash needs of our commercial networks and government systems segments include contract duration and program performance 
for example  if a program is performing well and meeting its contractual requirements  then its cash flow requirements are usually lower 
to further enhance our liquidity position  we may obtain additional financing  which could consist of debt  convertible debt or equity financing from public and or private capital markets 
in march  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec for the future sale of an unlimited amount of debt securities  
table of contents common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares  warrants and rights 
the securities may be offered from time to time  separately or together  directly by us  by selling security holders  or through underwriters  dealers or agents at amounts  prices  interest rates and other terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing and amount of cash required for our viasat satellite project and any future broadband satellite projects we may engage in  expansion of our research and development and marketing efforts  and the nature and timing of orders 
additionally  we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in complementary businesses  products and technologies which may require the use of cash or additional financing 
we believe that our current cash balances and net cash expected to be provided by operating activities along with availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal year this million decrease was primarily driven by our operating results net loss adjusted for depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges which generated million of higher cash outflows  coupled with a million year over year increase in cash used to fund net operating assets needs  offset by a million net cash inflow related to our refinancing of the notes 
the increase in cash outflows from our operating results was primarily due to the significant operating costs we incurred during fiscal year in connection with the launch and roll out of our viasat satellite and related ground infrastructure and the commencement of our exede broadband services  including upfront costs associated with our sales and marketing efforts  commissions and other costs associated with the acquisition of exede broadband subscribers  which negatively impacted income from operations 
the increase in net operating assets was mainly due to a million increase in combined billed and unbilled accounts receivables  net  during fiscal year compared to the last fiscal year attributable to the contractual timing of certain milestones in our government systems and commercial networks segments  offset by a million decrease in inventory mainly in our commercial networks and government systems segments during fiscal year compared to the last fiscal year primarily due to high demand for cpe terminals from domestic and international customers 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal year of million 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from a reduction of million in cash payments for the viasat satellite  placed in service in january  and a reduction of million in cash used for the related viasat ground network and operating systems  offset by million in higher capital expenditures for new cpe units and other general purpose equipment 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal year cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year reflected the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of the additional notes  offset by the repurchase and redemption of all of our million in aggregate principal amount of notes  and million in debt issuance costs 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year reflected the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of initial notes 
in addition  during fiscal year we had no borrowings or repayments under our credit facility compared to million in repayments  net of borrowings  under our credit facility during fiscal year cash provided by financing activities for both periods included cash received from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases  and cash used for the repurchase of common stock related to net share settlement of certain employee tax liabilities in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards 
satellite service related activities on may   we entered into an agreement with the boeing company boeing to purchase viasat  our second high capacity ka band satellite  at a price of approximately million  plus an additional amount for launch support services to be performed by boeing 

table of contents we have incurred higher operating costs in connection with the launch and roll out of our viasat satellite and related ground infrastructure and  beginning in january  the launch of our exede broadband services  as well as higher interest expense as we no longer capitalize the interest expense for the debt we incurred to finance these activities 
these higher operating costs included costs associated with depreciation  gateway connectivity  subscriber acquisition costs  logistics  customer care and various support systems 
these higher operating costs have negatively impacted income from operations during the past two fiscal years 
during fiscal year  the total number of subscribers of our exede broadband services increased  and we expect that this trend will continue 
accordingly  we expect that the resultant increase in service revenues in our satellite services segment will improve income loss from operations for that segment over time 
however  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we also expect our subscriber acquisition costs to increase during fiscal year due to the expected increase in the number of subscribers on our exede broadband services  which results in an increase of cpe related capital expenditures 
we are involved in a variety of claims  suits  investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including actions with respect to intellectual property claims and other matters 
see legal proceedings in item for a discussion of certain patent infringement litigation involving ss l and loral 
regardless of the outcome  litigation can have an adverse impact on us because we expect to incur costs  which may vary based on interim rulings  discovery and other related activities 
in addition  it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity in a particular period 
credit facility as of march   the credit facility provided a revolving line of credit of million including up to million of letters of credit with a maturity date of may  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either the highest of the federal funds rate plus  the eurodollar rate plus  or the administrative agent s prime rate as announced from time to time  or the eurodollar rate plus  in the case of each of and  an applicable margin that is based on our total leverage ratio

subsequent to the fiscal year end  on may   the credit facility was amended to increase the permitted total leverage ratio for each of the quarters of fiscal year senior notes discharge of indenture and loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with our issuance of the additional notes in october  we repurchased and redeemed all of our million in aggregate principal amount of notes then outstanding through a cash tender offer and redemption  and the indenture governing the notes was satisfied and discharged in accordance with its terms 
on october   we purchased approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the notes pursuant to the tender offer 
the total cash payment to purchase the tendered notes in the tender offer  including accrued and unpaid interest up to  but excluding  the repurchase date and a consent payment per  principal amount of notes tendered  was approximately million

contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of our obligations at march  for the fiscal years ending in thousands  including interest where applicable total thereafter operating leases and satellite capacity agreements other notes line of credit standby letters of credit satellite performance incentives purchase commitments including satellite related agreements total we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several subcontractors and contract manufacturers to provide design and manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors  contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
consequently  only a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable and unconditional commitments 
subsequent to the fiscal year end  we entered into a satellite construction contract for viasat  a second high capacity ka band satellite

our consolidated balance sheets included million and million of other liabilities as of march  and march   respectively  which primarily consisted of the long term portion of our satellite performance incentives obligation  our long term warranty obligations  the long term portion of deferred rent  long term portion of deferred revenue  long term deferred income taxes and long term unrecognized tax position liabilities 
with the exception of the long term portion of our satellite performance incentives obligation  these remaining liabilities have been excluded from the above table as the timing and or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable  short term and long term obligations  including the credit facility and the notes  and foreign currency forward contracts 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents 
as of march   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes  and we held no short term investments 
our notes bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our credit facility  cash equivalents  short term investments and short term obligations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balance in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
our cash and cash equivalents earn interest at variable rates 
given recent declines in interest rates  our interest income has been and may continue to be negatively impacted 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
if the underlying weighted average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents  assuming balances remain constant over a year  changed by basis points  interest income would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  for each of the fiscal years ended march  and march  because our investment policy restricts us to invest in conservative  interest bearing investments and because our business strategy does not rely on generating material returns from our investment portfolio  we do not expect our market risk exposure on our investment portfolio to be material 
our primary interest rate under the credit facility is the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin that is based on our total leverage ratio 
under the credit facility  the effective interest rate as of march  that would have been applied to any new eurodollar note based borrowings under the credit facility was approximately 
as of march   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
accordingly  assuming the outstanding balance remained constant over a year  changes in interest rates applicable to our credit facility would have no effect on our interest incurred and cash flow 
foreign exchange risk we generally conduct our business in us dollars 
however  as our international business is conducted in a variety of foreign currencies  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency risk is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of march   we had a number of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding which are intended to reduce the foreign currency risk for amounts payable to vendors in euros 
the foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of million had a fair value of approximately million and were 
table of contents recorded in accrued liabilities as of march  if the foreign currency forward rate for the euro to the us dollar on these foreign currency forward contracts had changed by  the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts as of march  would have changed by approximately million
