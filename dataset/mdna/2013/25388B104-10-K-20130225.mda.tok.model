accordingly  we recorded a non cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of million  or million after tax  relating to our single reporting unit 
the impairment charge is an estimate  pending receipt of final valuation information 
specifically  we have utilized an estimated market value of a non public equity security in calculating the goodwill impairment charge of million 
at the time of filing  we did not have all the material information required to complete the valuation of this investment 
if the investment valuation is higher than our cost basis  it may result in an additional goodwill impairment charge

at december   the company had a valuation allowance on approximately million of us deferred tax assets related to operating losses and million of deferred tax assets related to other us tax attributes 
we also have a valuation allowance on all of our foreign net operating losses of approximately million 
any future release of this valuation allowance will reduce expense 
liquidity and capital resources years ended december  cash flows in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  approximately of which are held by our international subsidiaries 
if funds held by our international subsidiaries were repatriated to the us  we would incur a us tax liability that is not currently accrued in our financial statements 
however  cash and cash equivalents held in the us are sufficient to fund our current and anticipated domestic operations 
as a result  we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions that would preclude us from funding our expansion or operating needs and do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings 
as of december  and  we had million and million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  respectively 
excluding client payables and client receivables  we had million and million in net short term liquidity as of the end of december  and  respectively 
our primary source of internal liquidity is our operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of net loss adjusted for non cash expenses offset by balance sheet changes such as the impairment of goodwill  deferred taxes  and changes in working capital such as accounts payable and income taxes payable 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of net income adjusted for non cash expenses offset by balance sheet changes such as an increase in accounts payable due to timing of client payments and decreases in accounts receivable and other accrued liabilities

financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million and million  in and  respectively  and in net cash provided by financing activities was million 
in  cash used in financing activities was primarily due to million of convertible senior note repurchases  million repurchases of common stock  million of restricted stock repurchases to satisfy tax withholdings obligation  proceeds of million were provided by sale of stock under the employee stock purchase plan and proceeds of million were provided by the exercise of stock options 
in  cash used in financing activities was primarily due to our million repurchase of common stock 
in our cash provided by financing increased primarily due to million of convertible notes issued  offset by debt issuance costs of million and million repurchase of common stock 
effect of exchange rate changes in  changes in foreign currency rates resulted in a million increase in our cash and cash equivalents 
exchange rate changes decreased our cash and cash equivalents by million and million in and  respectively 
the changes are due to foreign currency volatility on our international entity balance sheet exposures  primarily the euro 
auction rate securities as of december   we held million of auction rate securities ars at par value which we have recorded at million fair value 
as of december   we held million of ars at par value which was recorded at million fair value 
the ars are over collateralized and the underlying student loans are guaranteed by the us government 
almost all of these securities continue to fail at auction due to continued illiquid market conditions 
due to the illiquid market conditions  we recorded a temporary fair value reduction of our ars in the amount of million of par value as of december   under accumulated other comprehensive income loss  compared to a million temporary fair value reduction as of december  of par value 
the increased reduction in temporary fair value as a percent of par is due to certain securities receiving credit rating downgrades in in evaluating our ars portfolio  we note sustained performance of our securities  strong parity levels  observed market redemption activity  and continued receipt of interest and penalty payments 
as we expect to receive all contractual cash flows  we do not believe the unrealized losses to be credit related 
we continue to believe that we will be able to liquidate at par over time 
we do not intend to sell the investments prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis nor do we believe it is more likely than not we may be 
table of contents required to sell the investments prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis 
accordingly  we treated the fair value decline as temporary 
we anticipate we will have sufficient cash flow from operations to execute our business strategy and fund our operational needs 
we believe that capital markets are also available if we need to finance other investment alternatives 

table of contents the discounted cash flow model we used to value these securities included the following assumptions december  december  unobservable inputs redemption period in years credit ratings bb to aaa aaa to aaa penalty coupon rate to to weighted average annualized yield risk adjusted discount rate to to management makes estimates and assumptions about the ars  which can be sensitive to changes and effect the determination of fair value 
an increase in the length of redemption period or an increase in the discount rate assumption would decrease our fair value 
also  a decrease in the securities credit ratings would decrease our fair value 
the portfolio had a weighted average maturity of years and years as of december  and december   respectively 
we classify our ars as level long term investments until we receive a call or partial call on the securities 
upon receipt of a call or partial call  we classify the securities subject to the call or partial call  as level short term investments 
as of december  and december   our entire ars portfolio was classified as level long term investments 
in  we liquidated million of ars due to full calls  partial calls or sales at par 
in  we liquidated million of ars due to full or partial calls at par 
the amount of level assets as a percentage of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis was and in and  respectively 
commitments and guarantees at certain times  we enter into agreements where a letter of credit is required to ensure payment of future obligations by counterparties  such as our credit card processors and international taxing jurisdictions 
upon withdrawal  we are obligated to fund the executor bank on demand 
we have not set aside specific funds to cover this potential obligation as we can generally recover these costs from our clients 
if drawn upon  we expect to fund this commitment with cash and cash equivalents 
there were million and million in undrawn letters of credit at december  and  respectively 
in addition to the contractual obligations included in the table below  we will have significant cash obligations associated with the purchase of hardware and capitalized software to support our business 
cash outflows associated with the purchase of equipment and capitalized software were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we are also parties to legally binding contracts regarding goods and services under which the actual commitment is contingent on certain factors that are unknown or uncertain at this time 
therefore  these items are not included in the table 
uncertain income tax position liabilities of million are not included in the table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities 
in addition  purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table and any amounts which we are liable for under the purchase orders are included in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets
