item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted 

table of contents business and operational overview fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies 
we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately  company owned stores 
most of our customers are in the manufacturing and non residential construction markets 
the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro 
the non residential construction market includes general  electrical  plumbing  sheet metal  and road contractors 
other users of our product include farmers  truckers  railroads  mining companies  federal  state  and local governmental entities  schools  and certain retail trades 
geographically  our stores and customers are primarily located in north america 
like most industrial and construction centric organizations  we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years 
the third quarter of included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices between and of our sales consist of some type of fastener nuts  bolts  screws  etc 
most of which are made of steel and energy prices a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across north america 
in the fourth quarter of  and throughout much of  this inflation turned to deflation 
when the swings are dramatic  this can hurt our gross margins because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices 
this hurt our gross margins in the drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief  but it was small in comparison to the impact of deflation 
the deflation of ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross margins to recover in and see later discussion on gross margins 
the discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during this information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year 
however  we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales change  sequential trend  and end market information that follows that information explains the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty 
over the last several years  we have continued to make significant investments in store locations  national accounts  government sales  internal manufacturing support  international operations now over of our sales  fast solutions sm industrial vending  product expansion with particular emphasis on metalworking products and on exclusive brands  additional sales specialists to support safety products  metalworking products  and our manufacturing operations  and additional sales operational support to focus on under performing stores and under performing industrial vending 
we are excited about the prospects of each 
as always  the pathway to profit is the cornerstone of our business evolution  and it influences everything we do 
remember  our business centers on our  stores their individual success leads to the success of the entire organization over time 
as always  we will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of growth through customer service 
sales growth net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows net sales percentage change the increase in net sales in came primarily from higher unit sales 
our growth in net sales was impacted by price changes in our products  but the impact was limited 
our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services  but was helped by initiatives such as fast solutions sm industrial vending 
the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years 
the growth in net sales at the older store locations was hindered by weakness in the industrial production and non residential construction industries served by our company 
the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar lowered our daily sales growth rate by in

the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the moderating impacts of the previous recessionary environment 
the increase in net sales also resulted from the strengthening of the canadian currency relative to the united states dollar and from our holo krome business  which we acquired in december these two items added approximately and percentage points  respectively  to our growth in the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier 
these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets 
the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent same store view of our business store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier 
the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows store age opened greater than years opened greater than years opened greater than years note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales and approximately  or to net sales 
the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years  and  as stated earlier  the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 
sales by product line the approximate mix of sales from the fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows fastener product line other product lines 
table of contents monthly sales changes  sequential trends  and end market performance note daily sales are defined as the sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the united states in the period 
this section focuses on three distinct views of our business monthly sales changes  sequential trends  and end market performance 
the first discussion regarding monthly sales changes provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores 
the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is  comparing a period to the immediately preceding period in our business 
finally  we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 
monthly sales changes all company sales during the months in   and  all of our selling locations  when combined  had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year jan

the growth in the first three and a half months of generally continued the relative strength we saw in and in most of during there were two distinct economic slowdowns 
the first occurred in the late april may time frame  and then moderated until september 
the second occurred in the october november time frame 
this was exaggerated by an unusual business day comparison in october days in versus days in the maintenance portion of our business is often linked to monthly spend patterns  which are not as business day dependent  this can dilute the daily growth picture given the change in business day divisor and the impact of hurricane sandy 
the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar lowered our daily sales growth rate by during this lowered our growth in the first  second  and third quarters by    respectively and increased our growth in the fourth quarter by 
this was a sharp contrast to and  when changes in foreign currencies increased our growth by and  respectively

table of contents sequential trends we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april  july  and october to december  but generally speaking  climbs from january to october 
the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 
history has identified these landings in our business cycle 
they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays 
the first landing centers on easter  which alternates between march and april easter occurred in april in   and  the second landing centers on july th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmas new year holidays 
the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month to month or because they move around during the week 
the table below shows the pattern to our sequential change in our daily sales 
the line labeled past is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period to we chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics  a weaker industrial economy in north america  and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line 
the   and lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes 
the delta  delta  and delta lines indicate the difference between the past and the actual results in the respective year

table of contents several observations stand out while viewing the sequential pattern the direction of the historical sequential pattern increased daily sales on a sequential basis in february  march  may  june  august  and september and decreased daily sales on a sequential basis in april and july has played out each month  however  the cumulative growth in the daily sales from january to october has fallen short of the benchmark figure and of the actual results in and the magnitude of the february and may delta of approximately was similar 
this fact  as well as the choppiness of the year in general  caused us to approach the year with a conservative tone 
the weakness in was amplified in the first three quarters of the year by changes in foreign currencies primarily canada relative to the us dollar as indicated earlier 
end market performance fluctuations in end market business the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets 
to place this in perspective approximately of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing 
the daily sales to these customers grew in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year  and for the year  as follows q q q q annual our manufacturing business consists of two subsets the industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and the maintenance portion this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing 
the industrial business is more fastener centered  while the maintenance portion is represented by all product categories 
in the second  third  and fourth quarters of  the decrease in the rate of growth was more pronounced in our industrial production business 
this is in sharp contrast to the first quarter of where the growth was more pronounced in the industrial production business  a trend that had also existed in and the first quarter and prior quarters were a direct counter to the contraction  which was more severe in our industrial production business and less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business 
the best way to understand the change in our industrial production business is to examine the results in our fastener product line 
in the first three months of  the daily sales growth in our fastener product line was approximately 
this growth dropped to   and in april  may  and june  respectively  and then averaged and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
by contrast  the best way to understand the change in the maintenance portion of the manufacturing business is to examine the results in our non fastener product lines 
in the first three months of  the daily sales growth in our non fastener business was approximately 
this dropped to   and in april  may  and june  respectively  and averaged and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
the non fastener business has demonstrated relative resilience in  when compared to our fastener business and to the distribution industry in general  due to our strong fast solutions sm industrial vending program  this is discussed in greater detail later in this document 
the patterns related to the industrial production business  as noted above  are influenced by the movements noted in the purchasing manufacturers index pmi published by the institute for supply management http www

the pmi in   and was as follows jan

for background to readers not familiar with the pmi index  it is a monthly indicator of the economic health of the manufacturing sector 
five major indicators that influence the pmi index are new orders  inventory levels  productions  supplier deliveries  and the employment environment 
when a pmi of or higher is reported  this indicates expansion in the manufacturing industry compared to the previous month 
if the pmi is below  this represents a contraction in the manufacturing sector 

table of contents our non residential construction customers have historically represented to of our business 
the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year  and for the year  as follows q q q q annual we believe the weakness in the economy in the fourth quarter of  particularly in the non residential construction market  was amplified by the political uncertainty in the united states 
a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in   and  starting with a base of in the previous october and ending with the next october  would be as follows manufacturing

table of contents growth drivers of our business we grow by continuously adding customers and by increasing the activity with each customer 
we believe this growth is enhanced by our close proximity to our customers  which allows us to provide a range of services and product availability that our competitors can t easily match 
historically  we expanded our reach by opening stores at a very fast pace 
these openings were initially in the united states  but expanded beyond the united states beginning in the mid s 
in our first ten years of being public to  we opened stores at a rate approaching per year 
in the next ten years  we opened stores at an annual rate of approximately to and  over the last five years  at a rate of approximately to we currently expect to open approximately to stores in  or approximately to 
as we gained proximity to more customers  we continued to diversify our growth drivers 
this was done to provide existing store personnel with more tools to grow their business organically  and the results of this are reflected in our earlier discussion on sales growth at stores opened greater than five years 
in the early s  we began to expand our product lines  and we added new product knowledge to our bench 
this was our first big effort to diversify our growth drivers 
the next step began in the mid to late s when we began to add sales personnel with certain specialties or focus 
this began with our national accounts group in  and  over time  has expanded to include individuals dedicated to sales related to our internal manufacturing division  government sales  internet sales  specific products most recently metal working  and fast solutions sm industrial vending 
another step occurred at our sales locations this includes fastenal stores as well as strategic account stores and in plant locations and at our distribution centers  and began with a targeted merchandising and inventory placement strategy that included our customer service project approximately ten years ago and our master stocking hub initiative approximately five years ago 
this strategy allowed us to better target where to stock certain products local store  regional distribution center  master stocking hub  or supplier and allowed us to improve our fulfillment  lower our freight costs  and improve our ability to serve a broader range of customers 
our fast solutions sm industrial vending operation is a rapidly expanding component of our business 
we believe industrial vending is the next logical chapter in the fastenal story  we also believe it has the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution  and that we have a first mover advantage 
we are investing aggressively to maximize this advantage 
at our investor day in may  we discussed our progress with industrial vending 
in addition to our discussion regarding progress  we discussed our goals with the rollout of the industrial vending machines 
one of the goals we identified related to our rate of machine signings the first category below our goal was simple  sign  machines per quarter or an annualized run rate of  machines 
in  we hit our annual goal of  machines during july  and the momentum has continued as we finished the year 
we intend to continue our aggressive push with fast solutions sm industrial vending and  to this end  have established an internal goal to sign  machines in  or  per month rather than per quarter 
this is an aggressive goal  but we believe we can hit this run rate during in addition  during we developed plans to reinvigorate our fastener growth and to improve the performance ie sales growth at under performing locations 
these plans centered on expanding our sales team for industrial production business  improving our delivery systems for other fastener business  and expanding the team that supports under performing stores and districts 

table of contents the following table includes some statistics regarding our industrial vending business note we added the third category of information in this report to highlight the mix change in the machines deployed as our business expands beyond the flagship fast machine q q q q annual number of vending machines in contracts signed during the period cumulative machines installed percent of installed machines that are a fast our most common helix vending machine percent of total net sales to customers with vending machines daily sales growth to customers with vending machines this represents the gross number of machines signed during the quarter  not the number of contracts 
this represents the number of machines installed and dispensing product on the last day of the quarter

the growth in total sales vended and traditional to customers currently using a vending solution compared to the comparable period in the preceding year 

table of contents profit drivers of our business we grow our profits by continuously working to grow sales and to improve our relative profitability 
we also grow our profits by allowing our inherent profitability to shine through we refer to this as the pathway to profit 
the distinction is important 
we achieve improvements in our relative profitability by increasing our gross margin  by structurally lowering our operating expenses  or both 
we advance on the pathway to profit by increasing the average store size measured in terms of monthly sales  and by allowing the changing store mix to improve our profits 
this is best explained by comparing the varying profitability of our traditional stores in the table below 
the average store size for the group  and the average age  number of stores  and pre tax earnings data by store size for the fourth quarter of   and  respectively  were as follows sales per month average age years number of stores percentage of stores pre tax earnings percentage three months ended december  average store sales  to   to   to   to  over  strategic account overseas store company total three months ended december  average store sales  to   to   to   to  over  strategic account overseas store company total three months ended december  average store sales  to   to   to   to  over  strategic account overseas store company total note amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 
when we originally announced the pathway to profit strategy in  our goal was to increase our pre tax earnings  as a percentage of sales  from to 
this goal was to be accomplished by slowly moving the mix from the first three categories to   to  and  to  these groups represented of our store base in the first three months of  the last quarter before we announced the pathway to profit to the last three categories  to   to  and over  these groups represented of our store base in the fourth quarter of and by increasing the average store sales to approximately  per month 
the weak economic environment in caused our average store size to decrease  and consequently lowered our level of profitability  however  subsequent to we improved our gross margin and structurally lowered our operating expenses 
this improvement allowed us to amplify the pathway to profit and effectively lowered the average store size required to hit our goal 
today we believe we can accomplish our pathway to profit goal with average store sales of approximately  to  per month 
in the second quarter of we achieved a pre tax earnings percentage of with average store sales of  per month 
note dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars  not thousands 

table of contents store count and full time equivalent fte headcount the table that follows highlights certain impacts on our business of the pathway to profit since its introduction in under the pathway to profit we increased both our store count and our store fte headcount during and however  the rate of increase in store locations slowed and our fte headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in in the table that follows  we refer to our store net sales  locations  and personnel 
when we discuss store net sales  locations  and personnel  we are referring to fastenal stores and strategic account stores 
fastenal stores are either a traditional store  the typical format in the united states or canada  or an overseas store  which is the typical format outside the united states and canada 
this is discussed in greater detail earlier in this form k 
strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of large customers in a limited geographic market 
the sales  outside of our store group  relate to either our in plant locations  the portion of our internally manufactured product that is sold directly to a customer and not through a store including our holo krome business acquired in december  or our direct import business 
the breakdown of our sales  the average monthly sales per store  the number of stores at quarter end  the average headcount at our stores during a quarter  the average fte headcount during a quarter  and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit  for the third quarter of our peak quarter before the economy weakened  and for each of the last five quarters q q q q q q q total net sales reported less non store sales approximate store net sales approximate change since q change twelve months percentage of sales through a store average monthly sales per store using ending store count change since q change twelve months

table of contents statement of earnings information percentage of net sales for the periods ended december twelve month period net sales gross profit operating and administrative expenses gain loss on sale of property and equipment operating income interest income earnings before income taxes note amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 
gross profit percentage for decreased from  but stabilized in the second  third  and fourth quarters of the gross profit percentage in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters was as follows q q q q the fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by changes in transactional gross profit  organizational gross profit  and vendor incentive gross profit 
the transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized from the day to day fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs 
the organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains 
the third component relates to vendor volume allowances 
in the short term  periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories  while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third 
we believe a normal gross profit percentage range for our business is to 
this is based on our current mix of products  geographies  end markets  and end market uses such as industrial production business versus maintenance business 
our business operated below our expected gross profit range at the end of  and expanded into the low end of this range during in the second quarter of  we moved into the middle of the range as the three components of gross profit improved  the contribution being split fairly evenly between the three components 
we remained in the middle of the range until the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  our gross margin felt pressure and dropped to the lower end of the range 
this drop was primarily due to changes in our transactional margin primarily due to changes in product and customer mix  lower vendor incentive gross profit  and lower freight utilization 
the latter two items created half of the gross margin drop and are more of a seasonal issue 
in the first quarter of  our gross margin improved nominally over the previous quarter 
this was primarily caused by the seasonal improvement of vendor volume allowances as rising fuel prices offset our improvements in freight utilization 
in the second  third  and fourth quarters of  our gross margin improved when compared to the first quarter 
most of this improvement related to improvements in our transactional gross margin 
the improvement was partially offset by the weakening of our selling prices in certain foreign markets due to changes in the exchange rate 
one item of note  in the fourth quarter of we experienced a drop off in the freight component of our gross margin due to lower freight utilization  a typical pattern due to the seasonal drop off in business  this decline was offset by an improvement in the remaining portion of our transactional gross margin that centers on product transactional cost and customer pricing 
operating and administrative expenses improved relative to sales in both as a whole and the fourth quarter of versus as a whole and the fourth quarter of historically  our two largest components of operating and administrative expenses have consisted of employee related expenses approximately to and occupancy related expenses approximately to 
the remaining expenses cover a variety of items with selling transportation typically being the largest 

table of contents the three largest components of operating and administrative expenses grew as follows for the periods ended december compared to the comparable periods in the preceding year twelve month period employee related expenses occupancy related expenses selling transportation costs employee related expenses include payroll which includes cash compensation  stock option expense  and profit sharing  health care  personnel development  and social taxes 
the increase in was driven by the following factors average employee headcount  measured on a full time equivalent basis  grew  sales commissions grew  bonus amounts related to our growth drivers grew this includes items such as industrial vending bonuses and manager minimum pay adjustments  and our profit sharing contribution grew 
the increase in was driven by the following factors employee headcount  measured on a full time equivalent basis  grew  sales commissions grew this increase was amplified by stronger sales growth relative to  which had a meaningful impact on the commission earned  and higher gross profit margins  total bonuses earned increased due to our profit growth  hours worked per employee grew  and our profit sharing contribution grew 
occupancy related expenses include building rent and depreciation  building utility costs  equipment related to our stores and distribution locations  and fast solutions sm industrial vending equipment we consider the vending equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the expense as occupancy 
the increase in was driven by a dramatic increase in the amount of fast solutions sm industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this document  an increase in the number of locations  and increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years 
almost all of our occupancy increase in related to item a dramatic increase in the amount of fast solutions sm industrial vending equipment  as our energy savings offset most of the increase relating to items and 
the energy savings were driven by our efforts to lower energy consumption  a mild winter  and a drop in natural gas prices during the heating season 
the increase in was driven by the same factors noted above with one exception  in approximately of the increase was due to rising utility costs 
our selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in the cost of sales 
selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses increased in  however  they increased at a rate less than sales growth 
the increase in was primarily due to elevated fuel prices in the first quarter  and  in the case of the first  second  and third quarters  the impact of the expansion of our fleet related to additions to our non store sales personnel  particularly our industrial vending vehicles 
the increase in was primarily related to the increase in per gallon fuel costs discussed below and the expansion of our fleet related to additions to our non store sales personnel  particularly our industrial vending vehicles 
our selling and transportation costs in the fourth quarter of were comparable to those in the fourth quarter of because the per gallon fuel costs only grew nominally and the number of our industrial vending vehicles had normalized 
conversely  the increase in the fourth quarter of from the fourth quarter of was driven by the dramatic increase in per gallon fuel costs and the ramp up in the number of our industrial vending vehicles 

table of contents the last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline during the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately    and million  respectively 
during the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately    and million  respectively 
the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs  variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers  changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations  and changes in the number of other sales centered vehicles as a result of store openings and the expansion of our non store sales force 
these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semi tractors  straight trucks  and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of sales and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately between distribution and store and other sales centered use 
the average per gallon fuel costs in actual dollars and the percentage change on a year over year basis for the last three years was as follows per gallon average price q q q q annual average price diesel fuel gasoline price diesel fuel gasoline price diesel fuel gasoline per gallon price change q q q q annual change diesel fuel gasoline change diesel fuel gasoline average of the four quarterly figures contained in the table 
income taxes incomes taxes  as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  were approximately and for and  respectively 
as our international business and profits grow over time  the lower income tax rates in those jurisdictions  relative to the united states  have begun to lower our effective tax rate 

table of contents net earnings net earnings  net earnings per share eps  percentage change in net earnings  and the percentage change in eps  were as follows dollar amounts net earnings basic eps diluted eps percentage change net earnings basic eps diluted eps during  the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate 
during  the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate 
during  the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors included in the discussion on the improvements in the gross margin percentage and in the growth in operating expenses which was dramatically less than sales growth 
operational working capital operational working capital  which we define as accounts receivable and inventories  are highlighted below 
the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows dollar change accounts receivable inventories operational working capital annual percentage change accounts receivable inventories operational working capital for purposes of this discussion  we are defining operational working capital as accounts receivable  net and inventories 
the growth in accounts receivable noted above was driven by our sales growth in the final two months of the period 
the strong growth in recent years of our international business and large customer accounts has created some difficulty with managing the growth of accounts receivable relative to the growth in sales 
this was exaggerated by the short month in december versus business days versus days and due to a drop off in payment activity due to christmas day and new year day falling on a tuesday resulting in a number of our customers being shut down for the last full week of december 
we saw a similar short month impact in september also as indicated above  our sales in the last two months of the year grew from to by  however  our daily sales growth in the last two months of was which resulted in increased year end receivables 
our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable 
this is impacted by other aspects of our business 
for example  the dramatic economic slowdown in late and early caused our inventory to spike 
this occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns 
over the last decade  we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following new store openings  expanded stocking breadth at individual stores  expanded stocking breadth at our distributions centers for example  our master stocking hub in indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from to  expanded direct sourcing  expanded exclusive brands private label  and expanded fast solutions sm industrial vending solutions 
items   and  plus the impact of strong growth with national accounts and international expansion  created most of our inventory growth in both and 
table of contents as we indicated in earlier communications  our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ar i back to a better than a ratio 
on december  and  we had a ratio of and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows net cash provided of net earnings the increases in the net cash provided in each of the three years was primarily due to increases in earnings 
the lower percentage of the earnings figure in was primarily due to increases in inventory necessary to support our industrial vending and metalworking initiatives 
the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows at year end store distribution center total new stores open with the standard store model  which consists of a core stocking level of approximately thousand per location 
this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows net cash used of net earnings the changes in net cash used was primarily related to changes in our net capital expenditures as discussed below

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible 
the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable  the financial condition of a customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers 
inventory reserve this reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage 
the reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends 
the analysis includes inventory levels  sales information  physical inventory counts  cycle count adjustments  and the on hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
health insurance reserve this reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims 
the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
general insurance reserve this reserve is for general claims related to workers compensation  property and casualty losses  and other self insured losses 
the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
tax strategies our effective income tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we establish income tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing 
if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  we recognize the benefit 
we measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities 
we re evaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit  or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit  when i there is a completion of a tax audit  ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance  or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 
significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities  positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods 
legal reserves occasionally we are involved in legal matters 
the outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures 
we record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is reasonably possible  but not known or probable  and can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in most cases  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded 
although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation  the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded

risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this form k under the heading certain risks and uncertainties and item a 
risk factors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end 
commodity steel pricing we buy and sell various types of steel products  these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners 
during the last decade  there has been nominal movement in overall steel pricing  with some deflation occurring in the wake of the economic crisis of the far east markets that occurred in the late s 
this trend reversed to inflation in the period from late to the early part of and again from mid to the fall of in the first half of  we noted meaningful deflation 
in  we noted minimal price changes except for stainless steel which did inflate 
stainless steel products represent approximately of our business 
in and  we noted nominal price increases 
we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers 
commodity energy prices we have market risk for changes in gasoline  diesel fuel  natural gas  and electricity  however  this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight costs to our customers  the efficiency of our trucking distribution network  and the ability  over time  to manage our occupancy costs related to the heating and cooling of our facilities through better efficiency
